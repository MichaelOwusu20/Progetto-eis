Originally a hip-hop dancer and theatre-maker, in recent years he’s taken to photography and now all the threads of his work come together as what he calls a “choreo-photolist”. In this unique performance, the setup has Reid the photographer at the centre, a“studio” behind him where three dancers – Salomé Pressac, Slate Hemedi and Yvonne Smink – pose for the camera, and two large screens either side where Reid’s pictures appear as he takes them, extracting still moments from the moving scene in front of us. First, it’s the beautiful landscapes of their muscles, curves and skin, in black and white, and you do “find your eyes” as the title says, noticing scars, pores and wrinkles of skin you wouldn’t otherwise see. When he takes portraits, Reid tells us in voiceover, his aim is not to photograph what someone looks like, but what they’ve been through. In one arresting sequence, a couple’s playful embrace turns to a blur of struggle and control. Woven into the narration are episodes from Reid’s own life. He calls what he does “conflict photography”, not images of the battlefield, but the ravages of everyday war, especially that of a black person in the UK. He exposes the conflicts of his own life, to distressing depths of despair: addiction, depression, racism, the social care system. But he also shows us creativity, fantasy, collaboration and imagination taking flight. He is asking us to really see him, and the world around us. This isn’t dance, but it is full of choreography: in the models’ movement, their intertwining limbs, manipulation of fantastical props, or as setups become more elaborate, pole dancer Smink suspended in the air as a human kite. But it’s also in the way Reid directs them, live, forging the visual narrative in front of us, building something into being alongside his own story, sparsely told, but hugely impactful (he worked with dramaturg Keisha Thompson). This is a powerful show, filled with devastating honesty and wonder.

Kean has made no secret of his ambition to move to federal politics and on Sunday ruled out contending for the leadership of the NSW opposition, further fuelling speculation. However, Perrottet, a sharp performer in parliament and a key figure in the NSW right, has not yet spoken of his plans, other than to say he will not contest the leadership and that he intends to spend more time with his wife and seven children, aged between 2 and 13. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It’s probably too early to speculate but the more likely direction for Perrottet, say his friends, is to follow the two previous Liberal premiers, Mike Baird and Gladys Berejiklian, into business. Baird initially went into banking after politics, but is now the chief executive of HammondCare, a provider of aged and palliative care. Berejiklian is a senior executive at Optus. As a former commercial lawyer and with four years as state treasurer, as well as more than a year as premier, Perrottet is likely to be snapped up, if and when he calls politics a day. Both men are 41. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kean has time to work the numbers for a tilt at a federal seat, since the next federal election is not expected until 2025. Bradfield, which overlaps with Kean’s state seat of Hornsby, would be the easiest entry point, though Kean has apparently told friends he would consider running in a teal-held seat like North Sydney, previously held by his friend and fellow moderate Trent Zimmerman. The MP for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher, who is the manager of opposition business and a member of the moderate faction, was asked repeatedly whether he would run again. “I think any rational person would say exactly the same thing. I’ve considered my position before previous elections, but if you ask me, am I committed to serving the people of Bradfield? I’m absolutely committed to serving the people of Bradfield,” he told Patricia Karvelas on the ABC’s Radio National. There has also been speculation that Liberal MP Alex Hawke’s days are numbered in the seat of Mitchell. The local branches are now controlled by the hard-right faction, while Hawke is the leading figure of the centre-right. There is no love lost between the two factions, particularly after Hawke was blamed for holding up preselections for last year’s federal election in order to shore up the centre right’s position, a move that some in the party said contributed to the Liberal party’s loss. Hawke did not return the Guardian’s calls. Mitchell covers Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, Winston Hills, parts of Northmead and North Rocks in the south, along with new housing estates around Kellyville and Rouse Hill. Intriguingly, Perrottet grew up in the area and was previously the member for Castle Hill, then Hawkesbury, then Epping. His earlier seats overlap with Mitchell. Those close to Perrottet say his wife, Helen, had ruled out a move to federal politics because of the difficulties it would pose for the family. But a week is a long time in politics. A third former NSW minister, Victor Dominello, could also be Canberra bound, but not as an elected representative. The minister for government services, Bill Shorten, has sounded out Dominello for a possible role assisting with digital delivery of government services."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/22/afternoon-update-ita-buttrose-to-step-down-as-abc-chair-mark-latham-quits-one-nation-and-lachlan-murdoch-pays-13m","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T06:43:11Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Ita Buttrose to step down as ABC chair; Mark Latham quits One Nation; and Lachlan Murdoch pays $1.3m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/afternoon-update-ita-buttrose-to-step-down-as-abc-chair-mark-latham-quits-one-nation-and-lachlan-murdoch-pays-13m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/afternoon-update-ita-buttrose-to-step-down-as-abc-chair-mark-latham-quits-one-nation-and-lachlan-murdoch-pays-13m","fields":{"bodyText":"It is another afternoon of big names making news.

Randolph is a historic Black community in central Arizona flanked by railroads and heavy hazardous industries, a small dusty place where residents are exposed to some of the worst air quality in the state while lacking basic amenities like fire hydrants, trash collection and healthcare. Last year, the community celebrated a historic win when the state regulator rejected a proposal by the public utility Salt River Project (SRP) to more than double the size of its power plant, ruling that it would cause further harm to Randolph residents and was not in the public interest. It was major victory for clean energy and environmental justice in Arizona, according to the Sierra Club, the environmental group which condemned the proposed expansion as “textbook environmental racism”. But SRP has refused to take no for an answer, and residents fear that the state regulator might reverse its decision. “We won, they lost, but they won’t accept it and keep coming back. This is not democratic,” said Ron Jordan, 77, whose family has lived in Randolph since in the 1930s. “They are dangling goodies in front of us, but the community doesn’t want it, we already have too much pollution. This isn’t right.” At a recent community meeting held at the modest church, SRP offered to finance a new community centre, air quality monitoring and $50,000 in landscaping and signage among other projects if residents dropped their opposition to power plant expansion. “We’re not giving up no matter what they offer,” said Guadalupe Felix, 45, whose family have lived in Randolph for three generations. “This plant is going to kill us, we’re already suffocating.” The community says it won’t back down, but nationwide utilities have a track record of getting what they want, according to David Pomerantz, director of the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI). “Refusing to take no for an answer is incredibly common.” * * * Randolph is an unincorporated town in Pinal county first settled in the 1920s and 30s by mostly Black families from Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas who came to pick cotton in the Gila River valley. It was one of the only places Black families could buy property, and by the 1960s the close-knit agricultural community, which was also home to Mexicans and Native Americans, boasted thriving stores, bars, churches and gas stations. Mechanization of the cotton industry led to the community’s economic and population decline, after which the nearby town of Coolidge began annexing the land around Randolph and converted it into an industrial area. Today, only 150 or so residents live in an area the equivalent of seven football fields long by three fields wide, some in houses or plots purchased by their ancestors. There’s no store, no bar, no gas station and no park, just the church with a single lofty palm for shade. The agricultural fields and desert plains where children would ride their bikes and chase roadrunners are long gone, and Randolph is now virtually surrounded by polluting infrastructure including gas plants, pipelines, a hazardous waste site and a steel company contracted to manufacture Donald’s Trump’s border wall. The community is literally surrounded by cumulative and acute hazards. Pinal county has some of the worst air pollution in Arizona, according to the American Lung Association and the Environmental Protection Agency. It is also bearing the brunt of the climate crisis with farmers forced to leave fields fallow or sell them off, many to solar farms, due to ongoing drought and water shortages. In August 2021, a gas pipeline explosion threw Randolph residents out of bed, igniting a huge fireball that killed farm worker Luis Alvarez and his 14-year-old daughter Valeria. Part of the problem is the gas-fired power station, which lights up at night, hums like an airport, and spews out toxins and greenhouse gases from a dozen towering stacks. SRP purchased the plant in 2019, and two years later sought environmental approval from the Arizona corporation commission (ACC) for an almost a billion-dollar 820MW expansion. The ACC is the state utility regulator responsible for approving SRP’s power plants and transmission lines, as well as rate hikes and new energy projects for private energy, water and telecommunication utilities. Every state has a version of the ACC, most commonly referred to as a public utilities commission (PUC). As the community, the Sierra Club and others organised against the plant expansion, SRP announced plans to help finance road paving, landscaping projects and a scholarships and job training program, as well as an attempt to get Randolph recognised as a national historic place. In April 2022, the ACC rejected SRP’s expansion plan after concluding that the power company had failed to consider viable green energy alternatives such as solar and battery storage before pursuing the power plant expansion – which would worsen air quality especially for Randolph residents who live next door. (The commission rejected a recommendation by its power plant and line siting committee to grant the environmental certificate.) SRP requested a new hearing, which the ACC denied. The utility then filed – and lost – a lawsuit at the Maricopa county superior court. “The [ACC] determined that the need for the proposed project is outweighed by its environmental impact. SRP has not shown that decision to be unlawful or unreasonable,” the court ruled in January 2023. SRP still wouldn’t take no for an answer, and has since petitioned the state supreme court to hear the case, and persuaded the ACC to reopen discussion on the expansion. “SRP is used to getting its way, and it’s pushing on all fronts. The ACC has a huge impact in people’s lives, but the process wears communities down, it’s never over,” said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club’s Grand Canyon chapter. “It’s heartbreaking for the Randolph folks who finally felt that their voices had been heard.” Regulating utilities and influencing regulators The ACC, Arizona’s version of a PUC, was established in the state constitution and, unlike PUCs in other states, it is also responsible for railroad and pipeline safety, incorporating businesses and regulating securities. In most states, PUC commissioners are appointed by the governor, but in a quarter of states, including Arizona, the commissioners are elected directly by voters. “Utilities typically try to get a new decision from a PUC when they don’t like the original one about a rate hike or a new gas plant. They will wait it out [for new commissioners] or try to circumvent the commission altogether if they think the legislature will be friendlier to their cause,” said Pomerantz of the EPI. Last year, Indiana’s PUC, the utility regulatory commission, approved two new gas plants – three years after rejecting the power company’s initial proposal for failing to adequately consider renewables. In Virginia, state lawmakers who have received substantial donations from Dominion Energy, which also spends big in Washington, recently attempted to pass legislation to increase the company’s authorised profit margin despite households struggling to pay their bills. Utilities spend big on state politics and in the 2020 election cycle, investor-owned energy utilities contributed almost $12m to influential political organisations such as the Republican and Democrat governor and attorney general associations, according to an EPI analysis. To get what they want from Congress, electric utilities spent $347m on lobbying Washington in the past three years, including $3.4m by SRP affiliates, according to Open Secrets. Utilities are known to have directed large sums to influence campaigns in states with elected commissioners including Georgia, Louisiana and Arizona. In Arizona, the ACC is the primary governmental body for tackling the climate crisis. In 2006, it established an energy standard that mandated utilities to generate at least 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2025. The ACC is among just a handful of partisan utility regulators, and four of the current five commissioners – including the two new members elected in January – are Republicans. Kevin Thompson, who for 17 years worked for the state’s largest gas utility, and Nick Myers are both outspoken critics of the clean energy mandate. Shortly after the superior court judge sided with the ACC’s original decision blocking the plant expansion, the reconstituted commission allowed SRP to remake its case and voted unanimously to restart discussions with the power company. Since then, the SRP has provided Randolph residents with a list of possible community investments and concessions should the expansion be approved. “This is a classic case of systemic racism, one of many communities across the country where companies with money and power will go to any extreme to get what they want,” said Constance Jackson, the NAACP’s Pinal county branch president. “It’s sad the community has to go through this again because the decision was made. It should not be back on the ACC agenda.” JP Martin, an ACC spokesperson, said: “There is a drastic misunderstanding that the SRP extension in Coolidge is on any agenda. The commission’s legal division is engaging with SRP’s legal team – that is all that is currently known.” A utility spokesperson said: “SRP continues to believe that the ACC’s line siting committee, which heard all the testimony, toured the plant and toured the Randolph community, was correct when it approved the proposed expansion … The Coolidge expansion project would be required to comply with an air quality permit that restricts the emissions from the plant to levels that are protective of human health and the environment. The project also aligns with our commitment to clean energy and the transformation of the grid. “SRP continues to seek a collaborative solution with the Randolph community that would provide a way forward and we are committed to continuing to grow our relationship and partnership with the community.” In Randolph, residents are weary but not defeated. “I know it doesn’t look like it now, but Randolph was a great place to grow up. This is our history and we are the voices of our ancestors, so this place is priceless to me,” said Kyle Muldrow, 53, an army veteran and fourth generation resident. “The ACC made its decision, this should be over.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/20/advocates-oppose-queensland-police-power-to-treat-children-worse-than-adults-over-drug-offences","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-20T06:39:07Z","webTitle":"Advocates oppose Queensland police power to treat children worse than adults over drug offences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/20/advocates-oppose-queensland-police-power-to-treat-children-worse-than-adults-over-drug-offences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/20/advocates-oppose-queensland-police-power-to-treat-children-worse-than-adults-over-drug-offences","fields":{"bodyText":"The Queensland Human Rights Commission has sounded the alarm on “discriminatory” laws that would allow police to charge children over a first minor drug offence while letting adults off with a warning. The state government’s police powers and responsibilities and other legislation amendment bill would give adults caught carrying small quantities of illicit substances three chances before facing a criminal charge. Police officers would be forced to consider diversionary options for children but they would still be subject to police discretion under the new law, as revealed by Guardian Australia earlier this month. Bree Callanan, a senior lawyer at the QHRC, said the proposed laws were “a breach of the fundamental principle that children in the justice system should not be treated more harshly than adults”. At a parliamentary inquiry into the laws, Callanan said the measures were “at odds” with youth justice principles and a child’s entitlement to protection under the state’s Human Rights Act. This includes for laws to be in their best interests and for children to be treated without discrimination, she said. “We recommend [the legislation] … be amended so that a … child must receive a drug diversion warning … unless another diversionary option is taken under the Youth Justice Act,” Callanan told the public hearing on Monday. The chief executive officer of the Youth Advocacy Centre, Katherine Hayes, said the proposed laws would entrench children in the criminal justice system. Hayes said this was due to legislation introducing a new tougher sentencing regime for “serious repeat offenders” that was passed by the state government last week. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Children … are more likely to enter custody, which doesn’t effectively address the underlying causes of their use of the substances in the first place,” Hayes said. “This also will contribute to the overcrowding of detention centres and watch houses because of their cumulative effect, which is likely to occur in the coming months.” The Queensland police (QPS) said they supported the government’s approach in their response to submissions to the bill. They claimed that “applying the framework in a mandatory way to children would constrain the ability of police officers to use the existing diversionary options in section 11 of the [Youth Justice Act]”. “For that reason, the bill makes the use of drug diversion warnings and drug diversion assessment programs, in relation to children, discretionary,” QPS said. QPS also noted that the children’s court has the discretion to dismiss charges under the Youth Justice Act if they believe “police should have initiated a diversionary option rather than charging a child”. But the chair of children’s law at the Queensland Law Society, Damian Bartholomew, said while the court does have this discretionary power, children would still be disadvantaged as it would form part of their court history. “That will be quite different to what would be having to an adult in the equivalent situation where under this legislation they would be diverted and the matter would not be presented on their court history,” he told the hearing. It comes as the QHRC also expressed concern over a provision in the bill that would strengthen the drug trafficking offence from 25 years to life in prison, with Callanan dubbing it a “significant limitation on the right to liberty.” The commission also called for there to be no limitations on the number of warnings or diversionary measures that police can issue for a drug offence “unless there is evidence of commerciality”. The QHRC said they otherwise supported the bill and its commitment to a “harm reduction and health-based approach” to personal drug use and possession. The Queensland Mental Health Commission and Alcohol and Drug Foundation also backed the bill and said they hoped it could be a first step towards decriminalisation. Queensland’s mental health commissioner, Ivan Frkovic, said the bill was “an important development in drug law reform in Queensland” that has the potential to “alleviate demands on the justice system” and “achieve positive outcomes for people who use drugs, their families and the broader community”. The state manager at the Alcohol and Drug Foundation, Martin Milne, said 80-90% of illicit drug users are not dependent on drugs and for these people a criminal response does more harm than good. “On the other hand, for those who are dependent on illicit drugs criminalisation is also an ineffective and harmful response,” Milne said. “People who are most dependent on substances need effective health interventions rather than experiencing further harm from the criminal justice system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/28/artificial-intelligence-powering-politics-reboot-democracy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-28T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Artificial intelligence is powering politics – but it could also reboot democracy | Polly Curtis ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/artificial-intelligence-powering-politics-reboot-democracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/28/artificial-intelligence-powering-politics-reboot-democracy","fields":{"bodyText":"The YouTube clip I return to most often is David Bowie being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight in 1999. Bowie is talking about what the internet might do: “I don’t think we’ve even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think that the potential of what the internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we’re on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.” “It’s just a tool, isn’t it?” condescends Paxman. “It’s an alien life form,” insists Bowie. “Is there life on Mars? Yes, and it’s just landed here.” At the time of that Bowie interview I was writing a university dissertation titled Freedom of Speech in Cyberspace: the Challenge the Internet Poses to the Constitution of the United States. It was a heady time. The peak of internet utopia, with tech idealists promising that the decentralising nature of the internet would radically reform power dynamics, and democracy could be reborn. Fast forward 25-odd years and we know the opposite has happened: truth and trust have been eroded, democracy has failed to reform for the digital age and the relationship between those in power and those who elect them is strained to breaking point. It’s at this moment that we are seeing the proliferation of generative AI, and understandably the response has been a mixture of hysteria and hope. The hysteria about killer robots risks masking the real societal impacts that industrial revolutions inevitably have, sifting winners and losers, and disrupting ways of living in more subtle and sometimes pernicious ways. But there is hope for democracy in the AI revolution – if we put the right guardrails around it. If we make AI work for democracy, then in 10 years’ time our information ecosystems could be vastly improved to support democratic decision-making. We could train AI to value verified information, and serve it in ways that make the most complex information more accessible to more people. Politicians could be more trusted to do the right thing by people, because they’ve learned new ways to involve people in decision-making. AI citizens’ assemblies could help people and politicians to navigate through the trade-offs required to tackle the big problems. These concepts are not entirely outlandish. Polis is one such tool, developed in the US and used to shape policies most extensively in Taiwan, including to design regulation for Uber. Deceptively simple, Polis maps people’s views according to consensus, rather than division, and gives people options to suggest policy ideas. In the UK, we at Demos have worked with the Cabinet Office on Polis projects to engage experts and the public in the 2021 integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy. Andrew Gray, an independent candidate in July’s Selby and Ainsty byelection, is using it to power all his policies, declaring himself the first AI-powered politician. In a decade’s time we could repair the relationship between state and citizen. It could facilitate dialogue between MPs and constituents, enabling elements of direct democracy to supplement our representative system. AI could also allow for the better use of citizens’ data to target public services, interventions and support people on a more human level. AI could be used to guide people to access help from the state. But this will only happen if we make it happen. Because right now the incentives to develop generative AI are all commercial, with investors steering the development of the technology in ways that threaten to further leave democracy behind – not least because the talent, expertise and infrastructure follows the money, rather than where it could be used for common good. The Labour peer Jim Knight, who has been close to the latest digital bills going through parliament, makes a startling point: there are four legislative processes regarding digital under way at the moment, if you include the AI white paper published earlier this year. None of them mention protecting or promoting democracy as an explicit aim. Instead, they are concerned with online safety, digital markets and data protection. Democracy is the elephant in the room. Without focusing explicitly on the potential for AI to improve democracy – or at least do no harm – it will most probably corrupt. Distrusted information will proliferate, further eroding trust. But without explicitly updating our democracy to encompass more participatory activities that could be facilitated through these technologies, we will increasingly be left in a system that is centuries out of date, trying to govern in a world that moves at completely different speeds and in completely different ways.

At the meeting, Silveira allegedly asked Do Val to try to induce the country’s top electoral authority, the supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes, into making compromising comments in a taped telephone conversation. The recording would then be used to have De Moraes arrested, and prevent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from taking over as president on 1 January, Do Val claimed. Bolsonaro “sat in silence” while Silveira laid out the plot, said Do Val, who claimed that he had refused to join the conspiracy. The explosive allegations came as Silveira was arrested in the state of Rio de Janeiro on Thursday morning on De Moraes’s orders, having lost his parliamentary immunity with the end of his term a day earlier. De Moraes accuses Silveira, a hardcore Bolsonaro supporter who has previously been detained for threatening the electoral officials, of disobeying court orders and “complete disrespect and mockery” of the judiciary. De Moraes has ordered Do Val to testify before federal police within five days as part of the investigation into the former president’s alleged attempt to subvert democracy, Reuters reported. Do Val’s allegations add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that Bolsonaro sought to overturn the results of the October elections, which Lula won by a slim margin. Bolsonaro has still not officially conceded. These attempts seemingly culminated in the 8 January attack on the capital, Brasília, in which thousands of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked government buildings in what is being treated as an attempted power grab. In the days following the insurrection, police found a draft decree in the house of Anderson Torres, Bolsonaro’s former justice minister and the Brasília security chief at the time of the attacks. Analysts say the document could have been used to pave the way for a military coup. Torres is under arrest and due to give evidence to the police on Thursday. Bolsonaro himself is being investigated as a possible “intellectual author” of the attacks, while authorities are also scrutinising the role of the security forces, amid widespread evidence of collusion with the 8 January rioters. Do Val initially made the allegations during a Instagram live on Wednesday night, and an account of the alleged plot was published by the rightwing magazine Veja on Thursday, before Do Val gave his press conference. Under the headline “Indecent Proposal” Veja reported that Bolsonaro told Do Val that the national intelligence agency and presidential security cabinet were on board with the plan to entrap De Moraes. Do Val gave a different account at the press conference on Thursday, saying that Silveira did all the talking in the meeting and that there was no mention of the two security agencies. A military officer and trainer of elite security teams with a strong social media presence, Do Val was elected for an eight-year term as senator in 2018 riding the conservative wave that brought Bolsonaro to power. He was a staunch ally of the previous government in congress. Following his allegations on Wednesday night, he said on social media that he planned to “definitively” leave politics. Do Val is so far the closest Bolsonaro ally to have turned against the former president – a sign of his growing isolation. The far-right leader is holed up in Orlando, having fled to the US before Lula’s inauguration, and recently applied for a six-month tourist visa. At a fundraising event in Florida on Wednesday, Bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters that he plans to remain involved in Brazilian politics. According to political commentators in Brazil, however, members of his Liberal party believe he has lost any chance of trying to return to the presidency at the next election, in 2026. In a further indication of Bolsonaro’s diminished political clout, his candidate for the senate presidency, Rogério Marinho, lost to the Lula-backed Rodrigo Pacheco in an internal election on Wednesday. Police plan to take Do Val’s testimony as part of their investigations into the 8 January insurrection. Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president’s eldest son, said in congress on Thursday that the meeting described by Do Val “does not constitute any type of crime”. In a statement later, Flávio Bolsonaro said there was never any coup attempt and that his father is a “defender of law and order and has always played within the four lines of the Constitution.” During the inaugural session of the supreme court on Wednesday, Chief Justice Rosa Weber said:“[This court’s values] will never be touched or crushed by barbarity, and nor will its judges be intimidated by barbarity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:47:32Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: International Atomic Energy Agency raises grave concerns over shelling at nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"This blog is closing now, thanks for following the day’s developments. All our Ukraine news is here Here is a summary of events today: Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday on a three-nation visit with a reported aim of countering Russian influence on the continent. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain visited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv today. On Telegram Zelenskiy thanked her for meeting with him adding, such visits are “extremely valuable” for helping the world “hear, know and understand” what is happening in Ukraine. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain has met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Writing on Telegram, the president said: American actress Jessica Chastain is in Ukraine today. For us, such visits of famous people are extremely valuable. Thanks to this, the world will hear, know and understand the truth about what is happening in our country even more. Thanks for the support! Chastain also visited the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, according to Ukrainian public broadcaster, Suspilne News. Here are some images coming over the wires today. The Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine is a focus of attention in the war after Kyiv accused Russia of shelling the plant again and damaging radiation sensors. The plant, in Russian-controlled territory, was also shelled on Friday. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes. Reuters has put together some facts about Europe’s largest nuclear facility. Zaporizhzhia is the largest of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, which together provide about half the country’s electricity. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February was the first time war has broken out in a country with such a large and established nuclear power programme, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says. Zaporizhzhia’s six units each have a net capacity of 950 Megawatts electric, or a total of 5.7 Gigawatts electric, according to an IAEA database. The first unit was connected to the grid in 1984, and the last in 1995. The plant is of strategic importance to Russia because it is only about 200 km (125 miles) from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The plant was captured by Russian forces in the opening stage of the war but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the facility on Friday, prompting its operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. Ukrainian emergency services have released drone footage of a burning building in Mykolaiv, after what authorities say was a Russian strike. Mykolaiv borders the mostly Russian-occupied Kherson region. A medical facility in the southern port city was recently damaged in a Russian attack, which Mykolaiv’s mayor described as ‘terrorism’ Key developments today so far. Ukraine and Russia blamed each other on Sunday for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes.Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher.” Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant, which is in Russian-controlled territory and was also shelled on Friday. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs.The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the ships carrying grain saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians, which infuriated president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation if its Kyiv office head, Reuters reports. The report, published on Thursday, said the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit reportedly aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s February invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor has told Reuters. Of those charged, about 15 were in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remained at large, Yuriy Bilousov, head of the war crimes department of the prosecutor general’s office, said in an interview in the capital, Kyiv. Thirteen cases had been submitted to courts and seven verdicts issued, he said. In May, a 21-year-old captured Russian soldier became the first person to be convicted in a war crimes trial in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. He was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian. “Sometimes we’ve been asked why we prosecute such ... low-ranked officers. It’s just because they are physically here ... If generals were here physically and we were able to capture [them], we would definitely prosecute generals,” Reuters reported Bilousov as saying. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presents orders and the other state awards to service personnel and to members of the families of fallen soldiers in Kyiv on Sunday on the Air Force of Ukraine Day. Ukraine and Russia are pointing the finger at each other for shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for a stronger international response to fresh shelling at the plant, reportedly by Russian forces, Russian occupation authorities claimed on Sunday a strike reportedly by Ukrainian forces had damaged administrative buildings inside the complex, AFP reports. Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s largest atomic power complex that was occupied by Russia early in its offensive – has in recent days been the scene of military strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor. On Sunday, Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher,” AFP reports. “The projectiles fell within 400 metres of a working reactor,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted them as saying. The strike damaged some administrative buildings and fell in a “zone storing used nuclear fuel”. The information could not be independently verified. As Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the attacks, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned on Saturday of “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Amnesty International apologised on Sunday for “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians which infuriated President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation of its Kviy office head. The rights group published the report on Thursday saying the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion, Reuters reports. “Amnesty International deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” it said in an email to Reuters. “Amnesty International’s priority in this and in any conflict is ensuring that civilians are protected. Indeed, this was our sole objective when releasing this latest piece of research. While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused.” Zelenskiy accused the group of trying to shift responsibility from Russian aggression, while Amnesty’s Ukraine head, Oksana Pokalchuk, quit, saying the report was a propaganda gift for Moscow. Ukrainian officials say they try to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, has not commented on the rights report. In its email on Sunday, Amnesty said it had found Ukrainian forces next to civilian residences in 19 towns and villages it visited, exposing them to risk of incoming Russian fire. “This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,” it said. “We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations.” Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the first ships carrying grain previously blockaded by Russia, saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. At his weekly address to pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday, Pope Francis said: This step shows that it is possible to conduct dialogue to reach concrete results, which help everyone. This event presents itself as a sign of hope and my own heartfelt wish is that following this path, it will be possible to bring an end to the fighting and reach a just and lasting peace. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for stronger international response to Russia’s “nuclear terror” after reported new shelling at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear power plant. During a phone call with the European Council president, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy called for sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Twitter. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace today welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. More details about the training programme can be found in this report from last month. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said on Sunday that a worker was wounded when Russian forces again reportedly shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. It said on Telegram that the site of the plant’s dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel are stored in the open air, was hit by rocket attacks. Here is the UK’s Ministry of Defence latest intelligence update on Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent, AFP reports. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. South Africa has remained neutral in the Ukraine war, refusing to join Western calls to condemn Moscow, which had opposed apartheid before the end of white minority rule in 1994. Blinken will hold talks on Monday with his South African counterpart, Naledi Pandor, and also make an announcement on the US government’s new Africa strategy, Pretoria said in a statement. They will “discuss ongoing and recent developments relating to the global geopolitical situation,” it said. The state department last month called African countries “geostrategic players and critical partners on the most pressing issues of our day, from promoting an open and stable international system, to tackling the effects of climate change, food insecurity and global pandemics to shaping our technological and economic futures”. Blinken who is on his second trip to Africa since his appointment early last year, is due to proceed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda later this week. This analysis by the Guardian’s Africa correspondent Jason Burke of Lavrov’s tour gives a good insight into the battle for influence on the African continent. You can read it here: More details on the ships that have left Ukrainian ports. They included Glory, with a cargo of 66,000 tonnes of corn bound for Istanbul, and Riva Wind, loaded with 44,000 tonnes of corn, heading for Turkey’s Iskenderun, the Turkish defence ministry said. It said the other two vessels to have left Ukraine were Star Helena, with a cargo of 45,000 tonnes of meal heading to China, and Mustafa Necati, carrying 6,000 tonnes of sunflower oil and heading for Italy, Reuters reports. The JCC also said it was near finalisation of the shipping procedures to regularise operations to support implementation of the grain deal. The procedures were expected to be published early this week, it said. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement. The JCC said it has also authorized the movement, pending inspection, of Osprey S, inbound for Chornomorsk. That ship is currently at anchorage northwest of Istanbul and was to be inspected on Sunday. On Saturday, the JCC completed the inspection of Navistar, which was cleared to sail, and its joint inspection teams were to continue inspections on Sunday morning of the remaining two vessels that departed Ukrainian ports on Friday. The first ship to leave a Ukrainian port under the deal will not arrive in Lebanon on Sunday as planned, the Ukrainian embassy in Lebanon said. The Razoni left Odesa last Monday carrying 26,527 tonnes of corn. The embassy told Reuters the ship was “having a delay” and “not arriving today,” with no details on a new arrival date or the cause of the delay. Shipping data on MarineTraffic.com showed the Razoni off the Turkish coast on Sunday morning. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Ukraine’s Kherson region has died after an assassination attempt, local Moscow-backed authorities as saying.. Vitaly Gura, the deputy chief of the Kakhovka district, “died of his injuries”, local official Katerina Gubareva, said on Telegram, AFP reports. Gura was attacked at home on Saturday morning and was gravely wounded by bullets, a source in the Russian-backed administration is reported to have told TASS news agency. Kakhovka is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Kherson city. Several assassination attempts have been reported against officials in Ukrainian regions seized by Russia since the start of its military operation in Ukraine in February. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports, Ukrainian and Turkish officials said. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs, Reuters reports. The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the deal last month after UN warnings of possible outbreaks of famine in parts of the world due to a halt in grain shipments from Ukraine that had squeezed supplies and sent prices soaring. Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The JCC has authorised the departure of a total of five new vessels through the Black Sea corridor: four vessels outbound from Chornomorsk and Odesa carrying 161,084 metric tonnes of foodstuffs, and one inbound. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Reuters could not verify either side’s assertions about battlefield developments. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday said that over the past week its forces had “achieved powerful results” in destroying Russia’s logistics supplies and rear bases. He said in a late night address: “Every strike on the enemy’s ammunition depots, on their command posts, and on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians. Reuters also reports: Russia’s war in Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with most fighting shifting to a nearly 350-km (217-mile) front stretching southwest from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, British military intelligence said. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine to help fend off Moscow’s ongoing invasion, senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. The next weapons package to Ukraine from the United States was expected to be $1 billion and include munitions for long-range weapons and armoured medical transport vehicles, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. More on the Zaporizhzhia power plant Reuters reports: Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the plant, prompting operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. The plant was captured by Russian forces in early March, but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom blamed Russia for the damage at the power plant. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. The United States has accused Russia of using it as a “nuclear shield” while Russia’s defence ministry said damage to the plant had only been avoided thanks to the “skilful, competent and effective actions” of its units. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Saturday: I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster,” Both sides have accused each other of engaging in “nuclear terrorism”. Read more here: Good morning and welcome to the blog, where we start with a round-up of the latest developments. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was a rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of the Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement with it after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started and will be loaded with grain, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister said.

The unlikely prospect of Joe Biden reviving the dormant 2015 nuclear deal, potentially lifting sanctions and opening the way for Iran to make billions of dollars in oil exports, would be seen as a gross betrayal by supporters of three-month-long street protests, as well as a controversial signal to send to Ukraine about Washington’s priorities. The west has accused Iran of providing hundreds of drones to Russia, and urged the UN to investigate whether the supply represents a breach of Iran’s obligations under existing UN security council resolutions. But the EU’s Iran negotiators have insisted that restraining Iran’s nuclear programme must be treated separately from all other Iranian issues, including its arming of Russia and domestic suppression. At the weekend the head of Iran’s steering council of foreign relations, Kamal Kharazi, said the only remaining outstanding obstacle to a nuclear agreement was settling the long-running dispute between Iran and the UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA over the origins and explanation of nuclear particles found at three sites in 2019. He is one of the few Iranian officials to claim all the other issues between the US and Iran over the revival of the deal had been resolved. At the same time, after a pause of many months, IAEA inspectors, led by its deputy director general for safeguards, Massimo Aparo, visited Tehran to meet Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdullahian, described the visit as “positive and forward-looking”, giving the overall impression that parts of the regime want a deal. He said a meeting with the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, in Jordan last week gave an opportunity to “complete the discussions”. The UN inspectors left Tehran without any comment on their talks but expectations were low given the long history of failed attempts to extract plausible Iranian explanations for the presence of the nuclear particles. It is possible Tehran’s optimism is merely opportunistic posturing to see if Tehran can expose western divisions over the possibility of rejoining a nuclear deal at a time Iran is accused of committing gross human rights violations and arming Russia. Rumours continue to circulate that Iran is about to execute many more than the two protesters put to death so far. But voices within Iran’s diplomatic corps genuinely believe Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi needs to revive the deal and, if he does not do so, he will have made a historic mistake by driving an isolated Iran into Moscow’s embrace. Economic pressures have also been growing on Iran to strike a deal. Since the protests started, the value of the Iranian rial against the dollar has fallen nearly 20%. Afshin Khani, the top foreign exchange official at the country’s central bank, was forced to resign last week and there have been calls for the governor Ali Salehabadi to follow suit. He has denied reports he is about to raise interest rates by 5% to prop up the currency. But with inflation at just over 50% this summer and the price of cars projected to have doubled in three months, blame is being pinned on Raisi’s ineffectual government. Europe is determined not to give up hopes of salvaging the nuclear deal on the basis that if Iran starts enriching to 90% it will have enough enriched uranium to make a bomb even if it lacks the missile warheads to deliver. Borrell said last week: “In spite of the fact that the nuclear deal remains in a stalemate and the escalation of Iran’s nuclear programme is of great concern, we have to continue engaging as much as possible in trying to revive this deal. I still believe that we have to separate the sanctions on human rights and arms provision to Russia from the nuclear programme, the escalation of which is of great concern.” The IAEA board had on 11 November passed a resolution saying it was essential and urgent for Iran to cooperate with the board over the source of the nuclear particles. The three sites at which Iran has not given a “satisfactory answers” to the IAEA are located in Varamin and Turquzabad near Tehran and Marivan in Kurdistan province. Iran said the particles may have come from abroad. The IAEA estimated that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% – a level just below that required to produce a nuclear weapon – by 6.7kg since 21 August. Iran wants the IAEA to permanently resolve the issue of the sites before it will sign the revived nuclear deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T15:42:52Z","webTitle":"The power of speech in Ambridge | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2022/sep/02/the-power-of-speech-in-ambridge","fields":{"bodyText":"Fear not, George Grundy in fact said “back off” not “buck off” (or anything worse) in last Friday’s episode of The Archers (Letters, 23 August).

Three people have been killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. The number of people killed due to the rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday has increased to 12. The city authority said a 67-year-old wounded man died in the hospital overnight. Russian-installed administrators of Nova Kakhovka have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling a residential area in the city, injuring one person. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reports, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva. A planned visit by the UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been delayed by “some hours”, a diplomatic source has told Reuters. “He’s waiting to be able to travel safely,” a senior Ukrainian government official told the news agency. On Tuesday, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog met President Volodomyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy has praised Ukrainian troops in his nighttime address and singled out units operating near Bakhmut, saying “there is forward movement in various areas”. Putin claimed Tuesday Ukrainian losses during the conflict are near “catastrophic” and that the counterattack had not been successful in any area. The Russian president made the claim during televised meetings with war correspondents and military bloggers. “This is a massive counteroffensive, using strategic reserves that were prepared for this task,” Putin said. “They lost over 160, we lost 54 tanks, and some of them are subject to restoration and repair.” The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously on a resolution calling for Russia to immediately release imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Moscow has also flagged again that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin says he has been cheated by the west who have failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets. Ukrainian forces have been confirmed to have liberated the village of Neskuchne on Tuesday after Reuters journalists were able to reach the area. Russia has yet to acknowledge any gains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-adviser-says-war-in-deadlock-russia-appoints-new-black-sea-commander-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T19:13:47Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukrainian military intelligence believes Russia planning ‘provocation’ at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-adviser-says-war-in-deadlock-russia-appoints-new-black-sea-commander-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/18/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-adviser-says-war-in-deadlock-russia-appoints-new-black-sea-commander-live-news","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the United Nations must ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant occupied by Russian forces after meeting the UN secretary general, Antònio Guterres and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Lviv. Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Authorities updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry updated the number of Russian casualties to at least 44,300. Meanwhile, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths and found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces are preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. Russia’s foreign ministry rejected a proposal by UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to demilitarise the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it would make the facility “more vulnerable”, Reuters reports. The inhabitants of two villages in southern Russia near the Ukrainian border were evacuated on Thursday after a nearby ammunition storage depot caught fire but no one was hurt, an official said. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod region, said in a statement that emergency services were investigating the cause of the fire near the settlements of Timonovo and Soloti, 15km (9 miles) from Ukraine, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian news website posted a video it said showed a large ball of flame erupting from the base. Russia on Tuesday blamed saboteurs for orchestrating a series of explosions at an ammunition depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, further to the south. Authorities have updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. “Last night was one of the most tragic of the entire war in the Kharkiv region,” local governor Oleh Synehubov wrote on Telegram. During the meeting today in Lviv between the leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, the families of soldiers from the Azov regiment marched across the city, calling for the return of their loved ones. A number of soldiers from this regiment are being held by Russia since they surrendered in mid-May the Mariupol steel plant they had been defending for weeks. The families called for Russia to follow the Geneva convention on treatment of prisoners of war and provide their loved ones with what they need. Earlier this month, Russia’s supreme court on declared the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation, a designation that could lead to terror charges against some of the captured fighters. The regiment has been a key piece of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the alleged goal of “denazification”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. However, since then, its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins, with the unit integrating into the Ukrainian national guard. “While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said today. Erdoğan met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, in Lviv today to discuss, among other things, the deal to unblock the Ukraine’s ports that was brokered by the UN and Turkey. The three leaders also spoke urgently about the rising tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with Erdoğan warning of the danger of “another Chernobyl” disaster, Agence France-Presse is reporting. “We are worried. We do not want another Chernobyl,” said Erdoğan. Erdoğan mentioned Vladimir Putin once in his comments to reporters. “We discussed the exchange of prisoners of war and our initiatives in this regard,” he said. “We will continue to talk about that with Mr Putin.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has signed an agreement with Ukraine to help reconstruct infrastructure destroyed by the Russian invasion. Erdoğan is in Lviv today meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and UN chief António Guterres. Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, met in Lviv today to discuss the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s ports and the increasing tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In the meeting, leaders agreed upon the parameters of a possible mission led by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the power plant, which is the largest reactor in Europe. Zelenskiy told Guterres that this “deliberate and cynical terror on the part of the aggressor could have catastrophic consequences for Ukraine and the whole world”, according to a statement released by the office of the president. They agreed that an IAEA mission “must be carried out in a legal way through a territory free from occupiers”. Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv blames Russian forces. During the meeting, Guterres also told Zelenskiy of a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, “where Russia committed a cynical terrorist attack against Ukrainian prisoners of war,” the statement reads. Zelenskiy asked Guterres also to investigate “the issue of compliance by the Russian side with the agreements reached in the context of the withdrawal of Ukrainian defenders from Azovstal”. Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Kyiv has accused Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – Kyiv says it is Russian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN met in Lviv today to review the grain export deal and discuss the growing tensions around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Here are some photos of the visit: After meeting the UN secretary general, Antònio Guterres, in Lviv today, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the United Nations must ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant occupied by Russian forces, Reuters is reporting. On Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote that he and Guterres had discussed the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s blockaded ports and ease a worsening global food crisis, but “particular attention was paid to the topic of Russia’s nuclear blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP”. “This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,” Zelenskiy wrote. “Therefore, the UN must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarisation and complete liberation from Russian troops.” Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv says it is Russian forces who have shelled the facility. Today, Russia said it could shut down the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, after it came under shelling at the frontlines in Ukraine. Kyiv has since denounced the move as a risk that would increase nuclear catastrophe. Zelenskiy noted that he and Guterres also “agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation.” “We also discussed the possible directions of its development, the issue of illegal and forced deportation of Ukrainians, the release of our military personnel and medics from captivity,” he said. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet in Lviv to review the grain export deal. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. With tensions continuing to rise around the plant, scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster. Scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, was hit hard over the course of 12 hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine.

A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine, the Associated Press is reporting. Three MiG-31 fighters with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles arrived at the Chkalovsk airbase in the Baltic Sea enclave south of Lithuania as part of “additional measures of strategic deterrence”, Russia’s defence ministry said. The warplanes will be put on round-the-clock alert, according to the ministry. The Kinzhal has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept, the Russian military said. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. A video released by the ministry showed the fighters arriving at the base but not carrying the missiles. The deployment of Kinzhal missiles to Kaliningrad was an apparent showcasing of the Russian military’s capability to threaten Nato assets – Kaliningrad borders Nato members Poland and Lithuania. It comes after Moscow strongly criticised the deliveries of western weapons to Ukraine, accusing the US and its allies of fuelling the conflict. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, has been hit hard over the past few hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Here is footage: The 25th cargo ship carrying grain has departed Ukraine under a deal with Russia brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to unblock the country’s blockaded ports, Agence France-Presse is reporting. The ship, which is expected to reach Egypt in a few days, departed as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and UN chief António Guterres, who were key to the reaching of the accord, were convening in Lviv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The cargo ship I Maria departed from the port of Chornomorsk. It is loaded with 33,000 tonnes of corn,” Ukraine’s ports authority said in a statement on social media. It said that 600,000 tones of Ukrainian agricultural products had been shipped through a corridor agreed by Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul last month. “So far, 25 ships with Ukrainian products left the ports of Odessa, Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk for the Bosphorus strait,” the ports authority added. The grain agreement lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors through the naval mines laid by Kyiv, with the first commercial ship carrying grain leaving on 1 August. With Ukraine and Russia two of the world’s biggest grain exporters, the halt in exports caused grain prices to soar, fuelling fears of a rise in global food shortages, particularly in poor countries already experiencing shortfalls. With tensions continuing to rise around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster at the plant. The scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. “What the fuck do we need this war for?” Pavel Filatyev, a Russian soldier who fought in Ukraine, has fled his homeland and is risking prison to speak out against the invasion. The ex-paratrooper has published a 141-page bombshell breaking down the day-to-day activities of his unit after they were sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea and eventually entered and captured Kherson. “I simply can’t stay quiet any longer, even though I know that I probably won’t change anything, and maybe I’ve acted foolishly to get myself in so much trouble,” said Filatyev, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette. His memoir, ZOV, detailed how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine with no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said. At one point, Filatyev describes how the ravenous paratroopers, the elite of the Russian army, captured the Kherson seaport and immediately began grabbing “computers and whatever valuable goods we could find”. Then they ransacked the kitchens for food. “Like savages, we ate everything there: oats, porridge, jam, honey, coffee … We didn’t give a damn about anything, we’d already been pushed to the limit. Most had spent a month in the fields with no hint of comfort, a shower or normal food. “What a wild state you can drive people to by not giving any thought to the fact that they need to sleep, eat and wash,” he wrote. “Everything around gave us a vile feeling; like wretches we were just trying to survive.” Read more here: While Ukraine’s foreign ministry has the number of Russian casualties at about 44,300, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths (Russia’s defence ministry disclosed casualties only twice in March, acknowledging just 1,849 personnel killed). Looking into these deaths, Mediazona found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has provided an updated intelligence report on Russian troop locations and movement in Ukraine: Russian shells have again struck Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, yesterday and early this morning. In the attack this morning, at least one person was killed and 18 others injured, while seven were killed and 16 wounded on Wednesday. Here is a look at the destruction left behind: Ukraine’s foreign ministry has posted an update on Russia’s losses since the start of the invasion. According to the ministry, at least 44,300 Russian soldiers have been killed. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. Russian hacker group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said blocked access to more than 200 state and private Estonian institutions. The Estonian government said the impact of the attack was limited and went “largely unnoticed”. “Yesterday, Estonia was subject to the most extensive cyber-attacks it has faced since 2007,” its undersecretary for digital transformation said. “With some brief and minor exceptions, websites remained fully available throughout the day. The attack has gone largely unnoticed in Estonia.” Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Russia’s head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force said the building’s back-up support systems had been damaged in strikes. In the event of an accident, Igor Kirillov added, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused one another of orchestrating attacks on the plant and both have rebuffed each other’s accusations. Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, its interior minister has warned. Dozens of Ukraine’s emergency service workers wearing gas masks and hazmat suits took part in a disaster response drill amid fears of another Chernobyl-like disaster. The exercises saw them practice evacuating the injured, carrying out radiation scans, and washing down contaminated vehicles. “Nobody could have predicted that Russian troops would be firing on nuclear reactors with tanks. It is incredible,” Denys Monastyrsky said. As long as the plant is controlled by Russia there are “major risks”, the minister added. Russia has denied its forces had heavy weapons deployed at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, accusing Ukraine of stoking the fire ahead of a UN visit to the region. Kyiv was preparing a “provocation” during secretary general António Guterres’ stop that would see Moscow “accused of creating a man-made disaster at the plane,” its defence ministry said. “Russian troops have no heavy weapons either on the territory of the station or in the areas around it. There are only guard units,” a statement read. The ministry claimed Ukraine was deploying forces in the area and planned to launch artillery strikes on the plant from the city of Nikopol on Friday, coinciding with Guterres’s visit to Odessa. “The claim for the consequences [of the strikes] will be placed on the Russian armed forces,” the statement said. One more ship loaded with corn has left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, Turkey’s Defence Ministry has said. It is the first of four vessels to arrive at the country’s Black Sea port today, and marks the 25th to leave with grain under a UN-brokered export deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency has accepted Ukraine’s invitation to lead a delegation into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. “I emphasised the mission’s urgency to address nuclear security threats caused by Russia’s hostilities,” he added. The nuclear plant, which is Russian-occupied but run by Ukrainian staff, has faced intense shelling throughout the war, with both sides accusing one another of the attacks. Before I hand you over to my colleague, here is a quick rundown of where things stand: There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The strike follows yesterday’s attack on Kharkiv which killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. “What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. The southeast Asian country has maintained friendly ties with Russia and Moscow is seeking new customers for its energy in the region as its biggest export destination, Europe, will impose an embargo on Russian oil in phases later this year. “We have received permission to import petrol from Russia,” Reuters reports military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun as saying during a news conference on Wednesday, adding that it was favoured for its “quality and low cost”. There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The Kyiv Independent citied Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, as reporting that Russian forces launched rockets on Kharkiv overnight. Yesterday, another strike against a residential area killed seven people in Kharkiv. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank, the UK ministry of defence said in an update this morning. “This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the first Chechen war in 1994,” the report added. It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely. These deficiencies probably contribute to the widespread incidents of turret ejection, which are well documented in eye-witness videos from Ukraine.” The cumulative effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia’s forces,” British intelligence said. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. The statement comes amid fierce debate on whether the west should stop issuing Russian visas or discontinue allowing Russian citizens to visit on holiday. It’s hard to understand the nuances, it’s easier to hate and deny everyone - the solution is for an oyster. A smart man seeks allies, a fool repels friends.” These are tens and hundreds of thousands of people sitting on the fence who could switch to our side,” he wrote. And now they’re not going to do it.” The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, a senior Ukrainian presidential aide has said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Mykhaylo Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by the host and including India, Belarus, Mongolia, Tajikistan and other countries, China’s defence ministry said. China’s participation in the joint exercises was “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, the ministry said. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” (east) exercises from 30 August to 5 September, even as it wages a costly war in Ukraine. It said at the time that some foreign forces would participate, without naming them. China’s defence ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of a bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia. “The aim is to deepen practical and friendly cooperation with the armies of participating countries, enhance the level of strategic collaboration among the participating parties, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats.” Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The Black Sea fleet, which has a revered history in Russia, has suffered several humiliations since Russia invaded Ukraine in the hope of a swift victory. In April, Ukraine struck Russia’s flagship the Moskva, a huge cruiser, with Neptune missiles. It became the biggest warship to be sunk in combat for 40 years. A Russian strike on Kharkiv is believed to have killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Images of rescuers combining through the wreckage have since been shared by the emergency services. Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Ukrainian forces said on Thursday they had beaten back a Russian attack in the southern region of Kherson. “The stakes of the Russian Federation in this war have been raised,” Arestovych added. Ukraine’s ministry of defence said Russian forces were also moving aircraft further back into Crimea and away from the reach of Ukraine’s forces following the recent strikes in Crimea. “The Rashists [Russians] are urgently moving their planes and helicopters deep into the peninsula and to the airfields of the Russian Federation following the recent strikes in Crimea,” the ministry said in a briefing late last night. “The occupiers are carrying out measures to partially transfer aviation equipment from forward-based airfields in Crimea to reserve airfields and airfields permanently based on the territory of the Russian Federation,” the force added. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, in the western city of Lviv. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine ahead of a meeting later today with its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is 7.30am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A Russian strike on Kharkiv killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region that Russia has sought to blame on sabotage. At least 12 Russians were reportedly killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the state border guard service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Ukraine has not lost any US-supplied Himars rocket launchers, the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in contradiction to Russian claims. Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at about 11am on Tuesday. The first wartime shipment of UN food aid for Africa reached the Bosphorus Strait on Wednesday under a UN-backed deal to restore Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea. Marine traffic sites showed the MV Brave Commander taking its cargo of 23,000 tonnes of wheat across the heart of Istanbul bound for its final destination in Djibouti next week. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Canada has disbursed C$450m ($348m) in loans for the purchase of heating fuel before winter for Ukraine, the finance minister in Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland, has announced. Russia foresees a 38% rise in energy export earnings this year due to higher oil export volumes, coupled with rising gas prices, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters. Russia’s earnings from energy exports are forecast to reach $337.5bn this year, a 38% rise on 2021."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2022/sep/30/what-harnessing-geothermal-power-shares-with-fracking","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T05:00:31Z","webTitle":"What harnessing geothermal power shares with fracking ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/30/what-harnessing-geothermal-power-shares-with-fracking","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/sep/30/what-harnessing-geothermal-power-shares-with-fracking","fields":{"bodyText":"There can be few issues in the climate debate as controversial as fracking for gas. The release of methane from drilling and during the extraction process, plus the extra carbon dioxide from burning gas, makes climate change more rapid and dangerous. One of the arguments against fracking has also been the probability of triggering earthquakes. But environmental activists who use the earth tremor argument against fracking should probably be cautious if they are in favour of alternative solutions – gaining geothermal energy and lithium via boreholes from hot rocks beneath our feet. For geothermal power, these extraction systems work by drilling down two deep boreholes into the rocks and then pumping water round a loop. The hot water from the depths is potentially a large source of carbon-free renewable energy. Lithium, needed for batteries for electric cars, and in demand globally in ever increasing quantities, is extracted by a somewhat similar method, depending on the local geology. The water pumped round the deep boreholes under the West Country dissolves lithium from the rocks that is extracted when the hot water returns to the surface. Once operational the heat and lithium extraction schemes in Cornwall should have no detrimental effect on the climate, but unsurprisingly the extraction method, as at the Eden Project in Cornwall, also causes earth tremors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T03:04:46Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear inspectors shut down Russian ‘dirty bomb’ claim against Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/un-nuclear-inspectors-shut-down-russian-dirty-bomb-claim-against-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog has confirmed it found no sign of undeclared nuclear activity after inspecting three sites at Ukraine’s request in response to Russian allegations that work was being done on a “dirty bomb”. Moscow has accused Ukraine of planning to use such a bomb – a conventional explosive device laced with radioactive material – and said institutes linked to the nuclear industry were involved in preparations, without presenting evidence. Ukraine’s government denies the accusation. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, hailed the conclusion, calling it “quite obvious” in his latest national address. “We have invited the IAEA to check, we have given them full freedom of action at the relevant facilities, and we have clear and irrefutable evidence that no one in Ukraine has created or is creating any dirty bombs,” he said. “The only thing that is dirty in our region now is the heads of those in Moscow who, unfortunately, seized control of the Russian state and are terrorising Ukraine and the whole world.” Some Ukrainian and western officials have accused Moscow of making the allegation to give itself cover to detonate its own dirty bomb and pin the blame on Kyiv. The US rejected as “transparently false” Russia’s accusations. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, noted that “the world would see through any attempt by Russia to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation”. In a statement released late on Thursday, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said: “Over the past few days, the inspectors were able to carry out all activities that the IAEA had planned to conduct and were given unfettered access to the locations. “Based on the evaluation of the results available to date and the information provided by Ukraine, the agency did not find any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the locations.” The IAEA said in October it would inspect two locations in Ukraine after a request by Kyiv. On Monday it said those inspections had begun and on Thursday it said they had been completed at three locations rather than two, all of which had been mentioned by Russia. The IAEA named the locations as the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv, Eastern Mining and Processing Plant in Zhovti Kody, and Production Association Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant in Dnipro. The IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, said evaluation of the results “did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials” and environmental samples that were taken at the sites would be sent for lab analysis with results to be reported “as soon as possible”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/sep/06/david-littleproud-national-party-conference-dump-net-zero-commitment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-06T03:15:58Z","webTitle":"David Littleproud faces push at National party conference to dump net zero commitment ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/06/david-littleproud-national-party-conference-dump-net-zero-commitment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/sep/06/david-littleproud-national-party-conference-dump-net-zero-commitment","fields":{"bodyText":"The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, will face a concerted push at the federal conference of the party this weekend to dump its commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Guardian Australia has obtained a copy of a motion submitted by Barnaby Joyce’s federal electorate council in New England that calls on the Nationals parliamentary party room to “abolish its policy of net zero by 2050, and adopt a policy that will reduce Australia’s CO2 emissions in collaboration with the rest of the world”. The new motion – which some party sources interpret as a strategic strike intended to destabilise Littleproud’s leadership – has alarmed moderate Liberals because the Nationals abandoning net zero would reopen an acrimonious internal Coalition discussion about climate policy. As well as dumping net zero, the new motion championed by the New England FEC also calls on the Nationals party room to “ensure that any policies relating to CO2 emissions do not negatively affect on-farm production of food and fibre”. The conference push from Joyce’s party organisation in New England is ironic given the Nationals’ official commitment to the net zero target was actually settled while Joyce was party leader. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Nationals agreed to net zero in October 2021 after the prime minister at the time, Scott Morrison, made it clear ahead of UN-led climate talks in Glasgow that he wanted that target to be government policy. Joyce made it clear during a Nationals party room discussion to settle the policy commitment that he did not support net zero. But a majority of his colleagues – including Littleproud – did. In National party terms, Littleproud, historically, has been significantly more progressive on the climate transition than Joyce. Some Nationals believe the insurrection is likely to succeed at the weekend, although the motion is unlikely to be backed by conference delegates from Western Australia and Victoria. Joyce told Guardian Australia the motion “did not come from me”. But he also acknowledged he was “pleased they’re having the discussion.” Joyce said he would express a view on the motion at the Nationals’ conference “but right now in New England and many parts of Australia, the biggest issue I’m getting run over with is transmission lines, the diminution of value of people’s properties and ... being surrounded by a new industrial park”. “We seem to be wearing this: the transmission lines, the windfarms and solar factories in New England,” he said. “Everywhere else gets to feel virtuous, but we get completely run over with the impediments. You don’t hear any proposals to put wind and solar factories in [Sydney’s] North Head or Middle Head or transmission lines in Sydney or off the beaches. It wouldn’t be tolerated, understandably.” Joyce declared renewables projects and transmission lines were “turning the whole landscape into an industrial park” on behalf of the residents of cities and these were “completely changing” the landscape “for the worse”. “They don’t want any part of the infrastructure but they want the virtue of the source [of renewable energy].” Joyce claimed Labor had “completely botched” the transition to net zero, to the extent they are “now subsidising coalfire power stations” – a reference to the extension of the Eraring power station – because “they’ve got no alternative”. Ahead of the 2022 election a number of Queensland Nationals undercut the Coalition’s support of net zero, including the then candidate for Flynn and now MP Colin Boyce, who described the target as “flexible”, and senator Matt Canavan, who said that net zero was “over”. Asked about these comments and the Coalition’s position on net zero leading into the next election, the deputy Nationals leader, Perin Davey, recently told Guardian Australia: “Officially, we still have a net zero policy in the Nationals as well as in the Coalition.” “We’ve always been technology, not taxes,” she said on 24 August. “The Nationals have been very forthcoming in our openness to talk about nuclear. And we’re very pleased that the Liberals have now started to look at it and are actually making positive noises about nuclear too ... We’re very proud that we’ve led the way.” Littleproud, told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast in May that the Nationals’ engagement with young people would be improved by a focus on the “environment and articulating to them that we are serious about net zero and how we achieve it”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T16:10:51Z","webTitle":"Power is the drug, not the presidency | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/30/power-is-the-drug-not-the-presidency","fields":{"bodyText":"Michael Meadowcroft argues that “the problem of directly elected heads of state is that the power it confers all too often becomes an addiction that drives them to manipulate the constitutional safeguards” (Letters, 23 September). He then cites Ireland as an example of indirect election of presidents. In fact, the Irish presidency is directly elected. Mr Meadowcroft also cites the example of Donald Trump to support his argument. The issue in respect of Trump is not that the head of state is directly elected, it is that the head of state in the US is also effectively head of government. I agree that some politicians become addicted to power, but that is caused by the drug of governmental power, not the drug of presidency. I doubt that Trump would have had any interest in the presidency if the US had an Irish-style system where he would have had only ceremonial duties. In another letter, Margaret Squires expresses concerns about a President Thatcher or Blair. Again, I would doubt that a limited, ceremonial presidency would have held any attraction for them. And even if an electorate does choose a questionable president, they get the chance to get rid of them a few years later. If you have a questionable monarch, you have no choice but to wait for them to expire or abdicate.

However, the realities underlying the menacing vocabulary are a far greyer area than the bluster suggests. It is far from certain that Putin would be prepared to be the first leader to use nuclear weapons in wartime since 1945, over his territorial ambitions in Ukraine. If his primary goal is to stay in power, that could be exactly the wrong way of going about it. Even if he did issue the launch order, he has no guarantee it would be carried out. Nor can he be absolutely sure that the weapons and their delivery systems would work. On the US side, despite the US president’s apocalyptic language at a private fundraiser on Thursday night, it is not at all inevitable that Washington would respond to Putin’s nuclear use with nuclear retaliation. Past wargaming suggests there would be vigorous debate within the administration to say the least. Like US presidents, Putin is normally accompanied by an aide carrying a briefcase with codes used to authorise a nuclear launch. In the US it is called the football, in Russia it is the cheget. In the Russian system, the defence minister and the chief of the general staff have their own chegets but it is believed that Putin can order a launch without them. However, the cheget is relevant for the strategic nuclear forces, the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from land or sea, or long-range bombers. Because they need to be launched within minutes in case of enemy attack, the warheads need to be deployed, mounted on the delivery systems. Any nuclear use in Ukraine would be likely to involve non-strategic, or tactical, weapons with shorter-range delivery systems, and which are usually (but not necessarily) less powerful than strategic arms, though on average they are many times more powerful that the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs. The US only has one kind of tactical weapon, the B61 gravity bomb, of which there are about a hundred in Europe and a similar number in the US, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). FAS estimates Russia has 2,000 tactical weapons, in very many shapes and sizes for use on land, sea and air. The weapons are not deployed on missiles or aircraft, but kept in bunkers in storage sites dotted around Russia. There are 12 national storage sites, known in Russian military parlance as “Object S”, one of which is in Belgorod, right on the Ukrainian border. There are also 34 “base-level” sites, closer to the delivery systems. In a time of crisis, warheads would be moved from national to base-level sites – and up to now western intelligence agencies say no such movement has been observed. Any such movement would be carried out by the 12th main directorate of the Russian armed forces, which has the job of storing and maintaining the warheads and then delivering them in specialised trains or trucks to base-level sites, or directly to the unit designated to launch them. Pavel Baev, a military researcher who worked for the Soviet defence ministry, said that Putin cannot count on these weapons actually working. “Most of these warheads stored there are very old,” Baev, now a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said. “Without testing it’s really hard to say how suitable they are because many of them are past their expiration date.” Baev added that it was also far from clear that the Russian can successfully pair old warheads with the much newer delivery systems that would have to be used, possibly 9K720 Iskander or Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. Not all analysts have such a dim view of the state of the tactical arsenal. Pavel Podvig, who runs a research project called Russian Nuclear Forces and is a senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said: “There’s a maintenance protocol. There are ways of checking whether a weapon is in good health.” What may be more likely to break down, however, is the chain of command if Putin gave such an alarming and extreme order. “It’s one thing to follow the order to start a ‘special military operation’ that you understand will be over in three days,” Podvig said. “It’s another thing to accept the order to drop a nuclear bomb. There’s a sense that this kind of order would be universally considered as criminal. I think the calculation would change.” The Russian leader is already reported to be facing dissent from his inner circle. Taking the leap to nuclear use could stretch his authority to breaking point. “I think it would be prohibitively risky for any commander-in-chief to give this order because if you give the order and it’s not executed, it backfires,” Baev said. If Putin decided to gamble everything and if his military officers went along with him and managed to detonate a weapon in or around Ukraine, then Biden and his team would be faced with choices that all modern US presidents have hoped they would never have to make. US warnings to Russia in recent days have been vague on what the response would be, saying only that it would be “catastrophic”. The White House needs to keep its room for manoeuvre, depending on what Russia does, whether it is a “demonstration” blast over the Black Sea or the Arctic, or the bombing of a Ukrainian military target or – the worst-case scenario – a city. In 2016, the Obama administration carried out war gaming exercises to test its communications channels and decision-making process in the event of a Russian use of a tactical nuclear weapon. There were deep disagreements that led on some occasions to heated arguments. “The debate broke down along two pretty important lines,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was Barack Obama’s special assistant and senior director at the national security council for arms control and non-proliferation. The first question was whether “the US or Nato needed to respond militarily”. “In the game, the answer was no. The US was winning the conventional war,” Wolfsthal, who writes a Substack column titled BoomBoomBoom, said. The counter-argument was that the US could not afford not to respond with nuclear weapons. “There were those who said if you don’t use nuclear weapons, two terrible things will happen. One is: all of our allies will doubt our commitment,” he said. “The second is: if you don’t use a nuclear weapon in response, how do you deter Putin from going nuclear again? You needed nukes to re-establish deterrence. “We never answered that. We never settled that debate,” Wolfsthal said. The 2016 war game – first reported in The Bomb, a book by Fred Kaplan – was played twice, at the level of cabinet secretary, the “principals” and by their deputies. The principals voted to respond with a nuclear strike, but not on Russia, in the hope of avoiding an all-out planet-ending nuclear exchange. Instead they struck Belarus, arguing it was a “belligerent non-combatant”. The deputies voted not to respond with nuclear weapons, arguing that the US could win with conventional weapons and that nuclear use would make it much harder to isolate Putin internationally. Two of the officials who pushed that option are now in senior positions in the Biden administration: Colin Kahl is the Pentagon’s policy chief, and Avril Haines is the director of national intelligence. After the war games were over, Haines suggested having T-shirts printed with the slogan “Deputies Should Run the World”. The 2016 war game was set in a Baltic nation, so inside Nato and under its protective nuclear umbrella. Ukraine stands outside that umbrella. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary is reported to have voted for a nuclear response in 2016. He would not comment or even confirm the war game took place, but he said Ukraine was a very different case. “I would say that if the line is crossed to nuclear use, there has to be a very, very strong response,” he told the Guardian. “But that response doesn’t have to be nuclear.” The key question is more likely to be whether the US and its allies should respond with devastating conventional firepower, as Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, and the former CIA director David Petraeus have suggested. But that would transform the war into one between Russia and Nato, in which escalation to a nuclear exchange could become hard to stop. According to Eric Schlosser, the author of a book about the nuclear establishment, Command and Control, the Pentagon’s Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) conducted another war game in 2019 focused on Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. That wargame appears to have been updated, suggesting it is in constant use. The results in 2019 are top secret, but as Schlosser wrote in the Atlantic, one of the participants told him: “There were no happy outcomes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/feb/02/power-slap-is-this-the-most-stomach-churning-reality-tv-show-ever","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T15:34:15Z","webTitle":"Power Slap: is this the most stomach-churning reality TV show ever?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/02/power-slap-is-this-the-most-stomach-churning-reality-tv-show-ever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/feb/02/power-slap-is-this-the-most-stomach-churning-reality-tv-show-ever","fields":{"bodyText":"If you have your ear to the ground, there is a good chance you will be aware of a new TV show called Power Slap. If you haven’t heard of it, allow me to explain it. But strap yourself in, because hoo boy. Power Slap is a televised “sport” in which two people slap one other as hard as they can, with the aim of incapacitating their opponent to the point of unconsciousness. The players take turns unloading slaps so hard that it is uncomfortable to watch, while the opponent must stand with their arms by their side, since the rules forbid any form of defence (or even flinching). Power Slap has no British broadcaster, but in the US, where it is shown on TBS, it has caused a firestorm, not least because it is objectively stupid and dangerous, with slap fighters often ending up swollen and disfigured, and neurologists condemning the potential injuries they could sustain through repeated concussive impact to the head. And the people who run the league aren’t exactly lovely either. The show’s premiere was delayed, in fact, due to a video of Power Slap producer Dana White hitting his wife. A recent New Yorker piece did a good job of corralling the outrage. The boxer Ryan Garcia said: “Power slap is a horrible idea and it needs to be stopped.” Ariel Helwani, a sports journalist who reports on mixed martial arts, took aim at the state from which Power Slap is broadcast, saying: “Shame on Nevada for sanctioning that.” Even JT Tilley, who operates his own slap-fight league, admits that “90% of people can’t stand this sport”. But Power Slap is not just a sport. It is also a reality show, with the fighters all living together in a nice house, like the contestants on The Apprentice. The difference is that when the fighters leave the house, it is to hit each other as hard as they can. Does this make Power Slap the most awful reality show in the history of television? Not by a long shot. It sounds awful and exploitative, but is it any more awful and exploitative than Cheaters? That was the show in which members of the public could spy on their partners to see if they were unfaithful, before catching them in the act and – more often than not – having a screaming, knock-down fight with them. There was nothing about Cheaters that didn’t turn the stomach, yet it ran for more than 20 years. Is it worse than Fear Factor, a gameshow in which contestants had to commit to some of the most stomach-churning acts imaginable to win some cash? One episode, queasily titled Hee Haw! Hee Haw!, was so hideous that it was only shown on TV once, thanks to a challenge in which guests had to chug donkey semen and urine. But the most gruesome reality show of all time is probably The Moment of Truth, a 2008 US gameshow so sickening that 15 of its episodes were never aired. The premise? A subject is strapped to a polygraph and asked 100 questions of increasing intimacy. The more of these questions they agree to answer on air, the more money they win. In one episode, introduced by its own host as a piece of TV that didn’t deserve to see the light of day, a woman admitted to stealing money from work, to wishing she had married someone other than her husband (who was in the audience with his head in his hands), and to having sex with other men since being married. She was eliminated for answering yes to the question “Are you a good person?”. It was unimaginably horrible from start to finish. In fact, Power Slap may not even qualify as the worst reality show of the moment. Netflix is producing Squid Game: The Challenge, in which the fictional lethal knockout game is played for real by members of the public. While the reality version draws a line at killing the participants, there have been reports that multiple contestants have required medical assistance during filming, with others likening it to a war zone. It certainly sounds as if it will be very difficult to watch. Does Power Slap sound good? No. But the worst ever? Let’s retain some perspective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T23:48:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 477 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. “This is incredibly difficult,” the official said. “They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.” Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. “It is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,” he said. Three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. Three people were killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia’s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world’s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T17:51:19Z","webTitle":"Finnish PM faces battle to hang on to power as general election goes to wire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","fields":{"bodyText":"Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, was facing a battle to hold on to power on Sunday with the country’s conservative opposition National Coalition party (NCP) holding a narrow early lead in a knife-edge general election. Among the 40% of voters who cast their ballots before election day, the NCP garnered a score of 20.8%, fractionally ahead of Marin’s centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on 20.7%. The far-right nationalist Finns party scored 18.6%. The early vote tally is often skewed, however, and analysts warned against reading too much into the partial results as counting continued. Marin said after seeing the early results she was confident her party would win a big share of election-day votes. The party winning the vote will have the first shot at forming a coalition, but talks are set to be long and tortuous, with polls in the election run-up showing the three main parties in an almost dead heat and reliant on smaller parties to form a coalition. Marin, 37, became the world’s youngest prime minister when she assumed the leadership of the SDP – and the Finnish premiership – in 2019 and has successfully led the country through the Covid pandemic and to the brink of Nato membership. Her determination to enjoy a social life has also made headlines, with fans hailing her as a rising star of the centre-left and model for a new generation of young female leaders. Critics argue that her behaviour has at times been inappropriate for her office. She was forced to apologise and took a drug test last year, but also defended her right to party, after photos and video emerged of her drinking and dancing with friends. Marin remains more popular than her party and rival political leaders, with an opinion poll for the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper in December finding 64% of respondents felt she had done a “very” or “fairly” good job as prime minister. But with recession forecast and inflation surging, opposition leaders’ accusations of excessive government borrowing and inflated public spending – along with their pledges to impose tough cuts, particularly on welfare budgets – have proved effective. The NCP’s Petteri Orpo has promised to slash spending on unemployment and housing benefits. “The most important thing in the next government is to fix our economy and push economic growth,” he said during campaigning. Riikka Purra of the Finns – who were part of a coalition government from 2015 to 2017 – says their priority is to cut non-EU immigration, promising also to focus on climate, crime and energy policies if it is part of the new coalition. Whoever emerges as the winner, coalition negotiations are set to be tough, with the SDP and two of its current five-party coalition, the Greens and the Left Alliance, all ruling out any alliance with with the Finns, which Marin has called “openly racist”. Of the two others, the Swedish People’s party, a moderate party representing Swedish-speaking Finns, has said it is “very unlikely” to partner with the far-right Finns. The once-powerful agrarian Centre party, on the other hand, whose vote has plunged in recent years, will not join any coalition resembling the current one. The NCP has not excluded any combination, saying it will wait to see the results. If the NCP finishes first, it could try to put together a right-leaning “blue-black” coalition with the Finns, or pursue a broad “blue-red” alliance with the SDP, an outcome many analysts see as most likely despite obvious policy differences. As many as 10 parties could win seats in the 200-seat parliament. The outcome should be clear by midnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"US elementary school tested for nuclear bomb waste from Manhattan Project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","fields":{"bodyText":"The US army corps of engineers is testing for radioactivity in the kindergarten play yard, sports fields and classrooms of a Missouri school serving mostly Black students, after an independent report revealed the school may have been contaminated by nuclear bomb-making waste dumped from the second world war’s Manhattan Project. Children from Jana elementary school in the Northern St Louis area were sent home to do online learning last week, following an independent report that found levels of the radioactive isotype lead-210 as much as 22 times the expected levels in the school’s play yards and some indoor spaces. For decades nearby areas of North St Louis have been undergoing cleanup for radioactive dumping dating back to the 1940s through 1960s, after the region played an integral role in processing uranium for the development of the atomic bomb. Radioactive hotspots have been discovered in Coldwater Creek, which runs next to the original disposal sites some four miles from the school and then snakes past the school itself. The independent study released in October by a radiation testing firm, the Boston Chemical Data Corp, revealed concerning levels of radiation in locations including inside the school and its play yards. This prompted last week’s school shutdown. The report, which was paid for by a local law firm, also found levels of radium-226 in the school’s soil at double the expected background levels. The report said the level of radioactive lead found on the school grounds was many times higher than the levels allowed by the EPA for Superfund sites, the highly toxic places slated for government cleanups. It said the lead-210 likely resulted from the breakdown of other nuclear waste ingredients. “Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210 found on school grounds were entirely unacceptable,” said the report. It noted that the lead emits alpha particles, which are among the most biologically damaging type of radiation. The US army corps of engineers, which is in charge of the radiation cleanup, has questioned the findings of that report. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the corps was evaluating the independent study and would release its conclusions, as well as the results of its new sampling, in the next two weeks. It said that in 2018 and 2019 its own experts had “identified an area of low-level radioactive contamination on a densely wooded bank of Coldwater Creek. This area is just inside the edge of the school property and not easily accessible.” On Wednesday, teams of its workers in yellow and orange vests fanned out around the school grounds to redo the testing. One worker scanned the school lawn with a radiation detection device mounted on the end of a pole, others marked spots on the sports fields with bright orange bags, while a group of workers operating a boring machine collected core samples from the earth as deep as 28ft beneath the school. “Our team has the right expertise and experience to complete this work,” said Col. Kevin Golinghorst, the Corps’ St Louis District commander in a press release. Two blocks away from the school in a yellow and white tract home proudly displaying a sign on the porch that reads “Jana Elementary Student of the Month”, parent Rodney Green watched his two daughters studying math and English at his dining room table. “We already had to do this online learning during the pandemic – now it’s this,” he said. He was considering taking them to a doctor to test them for radiation effects. Now he worries about his home, which sits only a few houses from the creek. “What if we can’t live out here? Do I have to sell?” he said. “This is a whole community that’s affected. It’s crazy.” School PTA President Ashley Bernaugh, who has been asking for answers since the Army Corps first began testing near the school in 2018, said that she believes cleanup would have happened a lot faster if Jana elementary wasn’t in a mostly Black area. “Jana elementary’s radioactive past looks like a lot of other communities where hazardous waste has been allowed to exist in predominantly minority communities and in lower middle income communities, where it never would have been allowed in upper income level communities because of the public outrage,” said Bernaugh. The history of the radioactive waste in Northern St Louis goes back to 1942, when a company called Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, located along the Mississippi River in the city’s downtown, was contracted by the federal government to process the uranium that was eventually sent to New Mexico to make atomic bombs. The waste from that operation was stored near what is now the St Louis airport. In the 1960s, the waste was transferred to another company, which sold off valuable ingredients and transferred other portions of the waste to two other dump sites in the area. Cleanup of the dumps began in the late 1990s. Residents have been concerned about the health effects of lingering radiation for years. A 2013 Missouri health study found that the number of cases of leukemia, and breast, colon, prostrate, kidney and bladder cancers faced by residents in zip codes near the creek were “statistically significantly higher” than the rate for the rest of Missouri, according to reporting by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Jared Opsal, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, worried the radiation discovered at the school could pose particular dangers to children. “People – and especially children – should not still be collateral damage for World War II,” said Opsal, who said he hopes the federal government will expand and speed up its cleanup efforts, now slated to go on until 2038. “This is WWII nuclear weapons waste and people are still being harmed by it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T17:53:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 191 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian energy giant Gazprom has announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday. In a statement, the company claimed it had detected an oil leak at the main gas turbine at Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. It said the turbine could not operate safely until the leak was repaired, with no indication of how long that may take. An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plans to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of experts had stayed behind at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he said. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. The Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials were “making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit”. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday: “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA, which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” G7 finance ministers have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, the ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin warned that imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders decided to impose price caps on Russian oil, it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in the 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes. The government has said Ukraine could harvest 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying: “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continued to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counter-offensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova on Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Children returned to Ukrainian schools left damaged by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. A senior Russian oil executive died on Thursday after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:22:02Z","webTitle":"Russia readies for southern offensive as alarm raised over shelling of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. The assessment came as both sides traded blame for renewed shelling on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with the UN nuclear watchdog raising grave concerns about the attack. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” said the UK’s defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief. According to a separate source with Ukraine’s military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source. One of the major obstacles to Ukraine’s offensive in the south could be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe’s largest, which was shelled on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it was a crime and “an act of terror”, saying the shelling was carried out by Russian forces. In a phone call on Sunday with the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, about the plant, Zelenskiy called for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry and nuclear fuel in response. But the head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. It was not possible on Saturday to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. Ukraine’s nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said that containers of spent fuel had been hit in the latest shelling, damaging three radiation monitoring sensors and injuring one employee. Spent fuel is highly radioactive, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a statement on Telegram, Energoatom said the damage meant it was currently impossible to detect increased radiation or leakage of radiation from the spent fuel containers. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the size of the plant “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond”. The UK’s defence ministry predicts Russia’s war in Ukraine will soon enter a “new phase” as it believes the fighting will shift from Donbas to a 217-mile front stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson. At present, the brunt of Russia’s attacks is around what remains of Ukrainian-controlled eastern Donbas. Russian forces are still trying to achieve their aim of capturing the whole of Donbas. Russian forces now control Luhansk oblast, with the exception of a few small settlements, and about half of Donetsk oblast. Russia is currently carrying out two offensives to capture the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka and continuing to shell dozens of towns and villages from all directions, according to a statement by Ukraine’s general staff. Russian forces now appear to be occupying the southern part of Pisky, a village in Donetsk oblast near Avdivvka, as well as the small settlement of Travneve, 11 miles south of Bakhmut, according to the ISW, which reported that the Ukrainian army seemed to be holding the line elsewhere. Ukraine’s general staff said on Sunday that Russia was deploying troops and air defence systems to Belarus. However, the same Ukrainian military intelligence source said no offensive formations had been detected in Belarus, though rocket attacks from its northern neighbour continued to be a threat. Meanwhile, four more ships successfully left Ukraine’s ports, raising hopes that the deal brokered by Turkey and the UN to end Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports might hold. Russia’s decision to strike Odesa port hours after the deal was signed cast doubt on that. The deal is valid for 120 days and can be renewed if both sides agree. The first ship to set sail from Ukraine’s ports since the invasion left on Monday. Twenty million tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since February, pushing some import-dependent countries in the Middle East and north Africa toward famine. Before the war, Ukraine exported some 6m to 8m tons of grain a month. Using its rivers and railways, Ukraine is managing to export about 2m tons a month and hopes the reopening of its ports will increase the total to 3m a month in four to six weeks’ time, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told Bloomberg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"Guardian Essential poll: majority of Australians favour capping power prices, lifting wages and cheaper childcare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","fields":{"bodyText":"More than three-quarters of voters support capping electricity and gas prices and reducing the tax on petrol as Australians call for more cost-of-living relief in the lead-up to the budget. The Guardian Essential poll of 1,133 people found 77% of voters approve those measures, with a majority also in favour of increasing the minimum wage, cheaper childcare and cutting income tax. Voters were also overwhelmingly of the view that the prime minister should be required to get parliamentary approval before going to war, with 90% in favour and just 10% saying they should not need approval. Last week a parliamentary inquiry recommended that parliament have input after the decision to go to war, with ministers forced to explain the “legal basis” for going to war. The poll found respondents under cost-of-living pressure on a range of expenses, including 70% finding it “a bit difficult” or “struggling” to afford housing expenses including rent and mortgage payments, and 64% who said the same of utility bills. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Most voters said that governments could make a difference to the cost of living: 31% said “a lot” of difference, 40% “a fair amount”, 18% “not that much”, 5% “hardly anything” and 6% “unsure”. Support was highest for capping prices for electricity and gas, and reducing fuel excise, with 77% describing these as “something that would make a difference and the government should do”. However, 18% said cutting petrol tax was “something that would make a difference but the government should not do” and a further 5% said it wouldn’t work. A majority were also in favour of increasing the minimum wage (73%), making childcare cheaper (66%), cutting income tax (60%) and changing industrial laws so it’s easier for workers to negotiate pay rises (57%). On Friday the Albanese government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission’s annual minimum wage review calling for the wages of the low-paid to keep up with inflation. In the lead-up to the May budget the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has said the government’s job is to look at “how we can provide cost-of-living relief” without making the job of the Reserve Bank to reduce inflation harder. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said cost-of-living relief was a “priority” but needed to be provided in “the most responsible and affordable way consistent with the budget constraints that we’ve got, as well”. In addition to capping coal and gas prices, the energy price relief plan passed in December promised $1.5bn in consumer rebates to flow after the budget. In September, Labor made the unpopular decision to allow the temporary six-month halving of petrol tax to lapse. The poll was conducted last week after Labor and the Greens announced a deal with an absolute cap on emissions that helped the government pass its safeguard mechanism requiring industries to reduce emissions intensity in the Senate. The poll found the proportion of Australians who say not enough is being done to combat climate change fell four points to 39%, while those who said it is doing too much increased by four points to 16%. Thirty-three per cent said it was doing enough – up one point – while 12% said they did not know. About half (51%) backed the establishment of a national authority to manage the transition to renewable energy, a proposal supported by Australian unions and the Greens. Half were in support of “governments assessing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions when considering the approval of new projects, including coal and gas”, another measure backed by the Greens but rejected by Labor in negotiations. Despite the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, citing earlier Guardian Essential polling that 62% of Australians want to stop new coal, the new poll found support drops to just 34% when respondents were asked about “ending all future coal mining and gas extraction projects”. The safeguard deal imposed a requirement of net zero emissions on the Beetaloo basin and liquefied natural gas export projects, but not gas for domestic consumption, reflecting Labor’s view new projects might be needed to support its use as a transition fuel. There was a small movement within the margin of error in relation to Anthony Albanese’s approval, down one point to 52%, with disapproval up one to 35%. A bigger increase was recorded among those who said they “strongly disapproved” of the job he was doing, up three points to 17%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T05:01:08Z","webTitle":"US utilities shut off power to millions amid record corporate profits – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","fields":{"bodyText":"Some of America’s largest utilities cut power to millions of struggling customers in recent years even as they spent billions of dollars on stock buybacks, dividend payments to shareholders and executive salaries, a new analysis of industry data has found. The report also reveals that companies could use just a tiny fraction of their investor and executive spending to forgive debt at all households where power was cut. The shutoffs disproportionately affect low-income customers and those from communities of color, and the “harrowing” situation is driven by corporate profiteering, said Selah Goodson Bell, a study co-author and energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity. Losing power has an often devastating impact on a household, including in terms of health and safety. “Shutoffs allow corporate utilities to punish customers’ economic precarity while guaranteeing record profits and massive payouts for themselves and their investors,” the authors wrote in the report. It was compiled with the utility industry analyst Energy and Policy Institute and BailoutWatch. In the 30 states where shutoff data was available, utilities cut service 1.5m times during the first 10 months of 2022, and an estimated 4.2m times nationwide. The report also reveals the issue is worsening: the number of electric shutoffs jumped by nearly one-third and gas shutoffs spiked by 76% between 2021 and the first 10 months of 2022. Illinois posted the highest number of shutoffs during that time period at over 500,000, and it was followed by Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. Exelon Corp, the parent company to utility giants like ComEd in Illinois and Peco in Pennsylvania, reported 648,000 shutoffs. It was followed by The Southern Co, DTE Energy, Ameren and FirstEnergy. Some of the companies that probably have the highest totals aren’t included. Between 2020-2021, Florida utilities shut off power 1.4m times, a “staggering” figure largely driven by NextEra’s Florida Light and Power division. But Florida no longer requires utilities to keep track of disconnections. The report highlighted how little utilities would need to cut into dividends, stock buybacks and executive salaries to forgive customer debt. It examined financial filings from 12 large utilities responsible for 86% of the shutoffs between January 2020 and October 2022. On average each spent about $4bn on dividends, and customer debt from their collective 4.9m shutoffs totaled about 1% of their dividend spending. “That was one of the data points that really hit home because that’s just such a small scrape of the amount of money that utilities are shelling out to shareholders that could really change lives in millions of households,” Goodson Bell said. FirstEnergy, which serves Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio, shut off power about 240,000 times for customer debts totalling about $25m. Meanwhile, the company paid $2.3bn in dividends. The 12 companies collectively paid about 70 top executives $1.2bn, or about $5.9m annually per executive. NextEra, which cut power most frequently before it was no longer required to report data, is much more generous to its executives and shareholders. The company paid the highest average pay-per-executive at $11.2m, and spent the second highest on dividends at $8.1bn. Increasing gas and electricity prices are partly driving the number of shutoffs, but so are regulatory decisions to allow companies to almost always pass on increased costs to customers. Utilities also continue investing in capital-intensive projects that in many cases are good for their investors but not cost effective for consumers, who could benefit from community solar, rooftop solar or other distributed energy sources. As climate change creates more extreme hot and cold, more pressure is put on low-income customers who can’t afford the extra use of a furnace or air conditioner. The authors say addressing the situation would require including uniform federal record keeping, a halt on new fossil fuel investment, and a ban on punitive billing practices. States could tax utility profits to pay off customer debt, design more effective debt relief programs, eliminate consumer debt, and develop a percentage-of-income-based payment plan. But the clearest solution, Goodson Bell said, is a ban on shutoffs. “Since we see energy as a human right and shutoffs are not something that the utility industry needs to do to financially operate, we’re calling for a permanent ban,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"bodyText":"The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-24T12:44:59Z","webTitle":"How Landscape made Einstein a Go-Go: ‘It was so ahead of its time we waited a few months to release it’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","fields":{"bodyText":"John L Walters, songwriter, electronics, Lyricon We had been this cult and edgy instrumental jazz-punk-indie band that no one would sign. The nicest rejection letter I got was from Quincy Jones: “Great horns, great arrangements, pass owing to time commitments.” I’d started the band as a nine-piece to play my own music, which wasn’t very economically viable. We got it down to five and decided we’d try to make the band sound as big as possible using electronics. We were very conscious of the way technology was changing everything. Einstein a Go-Go was one of my first attempts at writing a tune to be played on a Lyricon – an electronic wind instrument that has a six-octave range. We actually demonstrated it on Tomorrow’s World. For Einstein a Go-Go, I programmed a simple drumbeat on a Dr Rhythm drum machine, then came up with the hook based on the jazz tunes I used to write in school. We’d always been instrumental, but I’d met Ian Dury on the pub circuit and been really inspired by the way he combined a big band with spoken-word lyrics, which had taken him from a cult act to No 1. My initial concept for the song was a joke based on the fact that Einstein played violin: “Don’t you know anything about time, Albert?” I’d read his biography and was also thinking about his famous quote that “God does not play dice” with the universe. But when I took the tune to Richard he said: “No, let’s make it about someone who idolises Einstein but is actually a nuclear terrorist.” The phone calls in the intro are genuine ones to the Kremlin and the White House. When we asked “Can we speak to President Carter?” they played for time so they could trace the call. Then we called the Iranian embassy: “Can we speak to the Ayatollah?” If you did all that today they’d send a Swat team, but we had a sign in the studio reading “No compromise”. We felt that the record company was going to drop us anyway so we might as well go for it. Richard James Burgess, songwriter, vocals, electronics I knew there was no way we’d have success with another instrumental album, but we also felt that bringing in a singer with a big ego could upset the chemistry and friendships we’d built up while doing over 200 gigs a year. So we decided to do it ourselves. I’d written lyrics in bands since my teens, so I ended up on vocals. The hot topic at the time was how the UK would have five minutes’ warning if the Soviet Union launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. We bounced that idea around and came up with a more cartoon Einstein reference: “Albert says that E = MC squared.” Superficially it’s a jokey, nothing song but it’s actually about the very scary subject of religious fundamentalism. Hence the line “Bible says we must pay. I am the judge for the judgment day.” We’d been out to Peter Gabriel’s place in Bath to borrow his Fairlight [synthesiser and sampler] and he’d played us his new song, Intruder. I was really struck by its idea of a malevolent presence, and made our song about a fundamentalist terrorist. We did all the pre-production in my house in Camberwell, then went into a proper studio to do vocals, guitar overdubs and such. Programming everything on a Roland MicroComposer was a very laborious process and if there was a power cut you lost everything. I’d been going to the Blitz club and realised the New Romantic scene was developing. After I played our stuff to Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp, he asked me to produce them, and I think the wind behind Spandau helped us. Also, the video was critically important to Einstein a Go-Go becoming a hit. We used dancers from [dance troupe] Shock, drums that looked like human faces and we had [trombonist] Pete Thoms’ disembodied head saying “Einstein a Go-Go.” The record stalled at No 32, but having played drums on Top of the Pops before with the Buggles, I knew that whenever a booked live act got stuck in fog at the airport, the BBC would more than likely replace them with a video. I told our manager to get down there with the video and that’s exactly what happened, which helped the song into the Top 5. Einstein a Go-Go always felt a bit ahead of its time. We actually held it back for a few months because we felt it would get more attention in 1981 than 1980.

Among his accusers was his own mother, forced to join in the taunting. China’s future leader was targeted mostly because his father, a top Communist cadre, was purged by Chairman Mao Zedong. His fall dragged the family down too; Xi’s half-sister died, reportedly after intense abuse. Half a century later, the teenage boy publicly humiliated in the capital has become China’s most powerful ruler since Mao, and perhaps – given his singular control of a superpower – the most powerful man in the world. His rise was not predestined. He fought his way to the top over decades, but with such discretion that when he took over in 2012, almost no one knew what type of leader he would be. His father, Xi Zhongxun, had been a respected party elder and a former vice-premier known for a relatively liberal outlook. For years, reformers inside and outside China hoped his son might have inherited his politics along with a strong physical resemblance. Instead, the younger Xi has bolstered the party and its networks of surveillance and control over individuals and business. He swept away norms of collective rule instituted after Mao died to concentrate power in his own hands, and fostered a personality cult to bolster his strongman approach. He is all but certain to end this week confirmed as national leader for a historic third term, and with his approach, which combines repression and surveillance at home with aggression abroad, cemented in place for at least five more years. A ‘red princeling’ shaped by Maoist indoctrination Xi was born a “red princeling”, a child of the Communist party elite, in 1953, four years after Mao declared the establishment of the new People’s Republic. His earliest years were a gilded, gated existence as a child of a senior party leader. He was educated in the elite August 1st School, a cradle of future leaders. The Cultural Revolution, launched by Mao in 1966 as part of an internal power struggle, shattered that world permanently. But there had been earlier warnings of horrors to come. In 1962, when Xi was nine, his father had a spectacular fall from grace. Accused of leading an “anti-party clique” – in the obscure world of elite Chinese politics part of the case against him was support for an obliquely critical novel – the elder Xi was sent into internal exile, managing a tractor factory hundreds of miles away. Then came the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when violent gangs of ideologically crazed teenage “red guards” held all of China ransom. At its peak, the elder Xi was beaten, publicly interrogated and paraded through the streets. He spent most of the following decade in prison. His downfall meant the next generation of his family became targets too. Xi Jinping’s half-sister is thought to have killed herself after intense persecution. At one point the future national leader was in a small group ambushed by club-wielding red guards at school and had to literally run for his life. The atmosphere was so volatile that when Xi once fled detention and ran home, his mother promptly reported him to authorities to avoid being accused of shielding him and bringing further trouble to the family, according to an account by Yang Ping, a friend of his father. “I had a stubborn streak in me and I couldn’t stand being bullied,” Xi recalled in an essay published in 2002. “I antagonised the radicals [red guards], and they blamed me for everything that went wrong.” In 1968, as part of Mao’s campaign to send young people to the countryside to be “re-educated” by peasants, Xi was sent to live in a tiny village in China’s north-west, to help with back-breaking rural labour. In the official narrative, Xi’s endurance of hardship in this period toughened him; Liangjiahe has now been turned into a pilgrimage site. “When I went to the countryside as a 15-year-old, I was perplexed and lost. By the time I left at the age of 22, I had a clear life goal and was filled with confidence,” he wrote in the 2002 essay. Xi returned to Beijing when universities reopened seven years later, and he was accepted as a “worker-peasant-soldier” student at Tsinghua University on a programme that enrolled students not on academic merit but class background. These years left him with a sense of threat and insecurity that would last his entire life, and manifest in his policies once he achieved ultimate power, analysts say. “He was influenced by the environment in which he grew up and the indoctrination he imbibed in his teenage years,” said Chen Daoyin, a former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “In his youth, he was always in an insecure position … He was psychologically vulnerable.” A former victim of political struggles, the elder Xi had lobbied for a law to protect the freedom to express political opinions. But the younger Xi was shaped by Maoist propaganda and brutal party politics, analysts say. “His father was a liberal, but he went to jail. To avoid his father’s fate, Xi learned to do things in an opposite fashion,” said Willy Lam, a veteran China watcher. Protecting the party and consolidating power The turmoil of that time traumatised everyone who lived through it. After Mao’s death, China’s leaders concluded that power should never again be concentrated in the hands of a single man. They set up a system of collective leadership that lasted until Xi’s rule. Xi Jinping appears to have drawn almost the opposite conclusion and reverted to Mao’s ruling style. Both in his image and rhetoric, he emulates the late Great Leader. He has accumulated power, shored up the authority of the Communist party and cultivated a personality cult, as if personal strength and the system that once tormented him were China’s only bulwark against another descent into chaos. Under his decade-long rule, authorities have vastly expanded censorship and party controls on the economy, created a sprawling network of internment camps in western Xinjiang and have been accused of genocide for abuses including mass detentions and forced sterilisation. Across China they carried out the harshest crackdown on civil society since the bloody destruction of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. Human rights lawyers have been detained, jailed or disqualified, non-governmental organisations have been closed or forced to disband, media censorship tightened and outspoken journalists and activists jailed or silenced. “The lesson that Xi had learned was that by being a good and obedient communist, you could survive and even thrive, even if that meant forgetting the party’s treatment of his father,” said Prof Michel Bonnin, an expert on the Cultural Revolution at the Paris-based École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. “It was better to be a good child of Chairman Mao than a rebel.” He never turned on the organisation that had presided over his early misery and loss, applying for party membership seven times. He was only granted it after his father’s political status had been downgraded from its Cultural Revolution extremes. Instead, after university he set out on an initially uneventful career as a young cadre, his path smoothed by his parents – who reportedly put in calls to his first boss in central China and then pulled strings to have him moved to coastal Fujian province. He spent the best part of two decades there, rising slowly but steadily through party ranks, from a peripheral district to provincial party chief, while commuting to Beijing to spend time with his glamorous second wife, the singer Peng Liyuan. Peng, whose elegant image helps boost China’s soft power abroad, once performed for the troops who cleared democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square. Xi was in Fujian when one of the biggest corruption scandals of recent decades came to light. Authorities raided the “red mansion”, where a wealthy businessman treated officials to food, drink and sex workers, in order to curry favour for his projects. Yet somehow he emerged personally unscathed. Instead, he may have taken away a heightened sense of how corruption was eroding public faith in the party, and how anti-corruption drives could be used to target political rivals. Purges have been a key instrument in his consolidation of power over the last decade, reaching to the very top of the party. When he was not yet 40, another traumatic upheaval sharpened Xi’s instinct for autocracy – this time a geopolitical collapse, rather than a national or personal crisis. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991, after Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempt at reforms, has haunted China’s Communist party. To Xi, the implosion of the party and system that inspired China’s own communists was a warning that political liberalisation and a lapse in ideological control would lead to disaster. He saw a political vulnerability that matched his personal insecurities. Soon after he came to power in late 2012 he told party cadres that they must study the collapse of their neighbour, and return to Leninist discipline. “In the end, just one blithe word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist party, and a great party was gone,” Xi reportedly said. “In the end, there was no real man who came out to resist.” It was a failure Xi was determined not to repeat. Yet while Xi has deftly consolidated power and removed obstacles to his rule, critics say he lacks intellectual grounding for leadership, even if “Xi Jinping Thought”, his contribution to the Chinese Communist canon, has been enshrined into the state constitution and is studied across China. He earned his PhD in Marxist theory and ideological and political education from Tsinghua University at a time when he was also governor of Fujian province, which is unlikely to have left much time to study, according to Cai Xia, a former professor at the party school who now lives in exile. “Why, unlike his predecessors, is Xi so resistant to others’ advice?” she wrote in a recent article for Foreign Affairs. “Part of the reason I suspect is that he suffers from an inferiority complex, knowing that he is poorly educated in comparison with other top CCP leaders.” His insecurities may have fuelled both paranoia and an aggression that makes it harder for him to reverse course on bad policy; his concentration of power has stifled dissent in the party that once helped thrash out ideas. A quest for total control Xi’s fear of the disintegration of the party and collapse of its rule translates into a quest for total control over everything, from the personal lives of individuals to China’s giant multinational firms, say analysts. “What strikes me most about Xi Jinping is his Stalinist way of governance, using his apparatus to purge the party, [emphasising] the party’s unified leadership and going back to the real party dictatorship,” said Jean-Philippe Béja, a research emeritus professor at Sciences Po in Paris. “No one is beyond the reach of the party.” Businesses that fuelled China’s extraordinary three decades of growth, from tech giants to tutoring companies, have in recent years found the party demanding either a stake or more oversight, installing officials and demanding party cells be set up. During Xi’s rule, the party has reached into the private sector and family lives in ways not seen since the start of the “reform and opening” era under Deng Xiaoping in 1978, meddling in details such as how much time young people can spend playing video games. The CCP’s love of control, and growing ability to monitor digital communication, has been thrown into relief by its handling of the Covid outbreak. The pandemic provided excuse and motivation to bring in an all-encompassing tracking of citizens’ lives and movements that analysts say is reminiscent of Mao-era totalitarian controls, but turbo-charged by modern technology. Xi this week said he remains committed to the zero-Covid policy of total elimination, even as the rest of the world opens up and learns to live with the virus. Like Stalin, Xi believes in party control by party institutions, making him “a more orthodox Marxist-Leninist leader than Mao”, said Bonnin. “The obvious problem is that the country might choke under such tight and rigid control.” He has upended foreign policy too, after decades of following Deng Xiaoping’s exhortation to keep a low profile – or “hide your light and bide your time”. Under Xi, China has seen rapid military expansion in the South China Sea, effectively taken control of Hong Kong, and ramped up threats against Taiwan. A cohort of aggressive “wolf warrior” foreign envoys, meanwhile, have cast aside diplomatic conventions. And in his third term there is no expectation that Xi’s ideology or principles will shift, even though he faces increasing headwinds. In Xi’s speech at the opening of the party congress on Sunday, he urged cadres to “dare to struggle” – using the word douzheng (“struggle”) that was widely used in the Mao era – and extolled “a fighting spirit” to defend national dignity and national interests amid a “turbulent” international situation. The economy is ailing amid greater state meddling and the fallout from Covid, there is domestic discontent over the handling of the pandemic, and tensions with the west have been rising for years over issues from trade to the treatment of Uyghurs. But if anything, political triumph is likely to cement Xi’s hardline instincts to protect a system that many “red princelings” like him see as both inheritance and mission. “In their eyes, the nation was fought for and won by their father’s generation,” said Song Yongyi, a US-based historian of the Cultural Revolution. “It belongs to them and their families.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T10:55:55Z","webTitle":"Blue review – racial violence, love and loss in a lyrical and angry work of unflinching power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/21/blue-review-tinuke-craig-jeanine-tesori-english-national-opera","fields":{"bodyText":"Hugely admired in the US after its first performance at the Glimmerglass festival in 2019, Jeanine Tesori’s powerful Blue gets its UK premiere at English National Opera in a production by Tinuke Craig, conducted by Matthew Kofi Waldren. Setting a text by Tazewell Thompson, it’s an angry but lyrical work that deals unflinchingly with the impact of racial discrimination, police brutality and racially motivated violence on a Black family in present day Harlem. The narrative is horribly and tragically familiar. Tazewell’s relatively straightforward dramatic premise brings complex emotional resonances in its wake. At the work’s centre is the murder, at a peaceful protest, of a Black policeman’s son by one of his father’s white colleagues, an act that is never shown, though we witness the events that surround it. Around the time of his birth, the boy’s mother and her friends worry about his future in a prejudiced world, and years later we find father and son locked in ideological conflict over the former’s job. After the murder, there is only grief, as a painful confrontation between the father and the Reverend who fails to console him leads us to the son’s funeral. There are no easy answers to anything we have seen, and at the end an epilogue takes us back to what, we gradually realise, was the family’s last meal together. Tesori’s score largely adheres to traditional structures of arias and ensembles, though it also has a directness of expression that proves persuasive. The pace falters at the start with a meandering extended quartet for the mother and her friends, but the music gradually begins to hit home. The scene for the father and the Reverend, and an agonised aria for the mother, have considerable power. There are allusions throughout to gospel, blues and jazz, and a swerve towards oratorio in the formal hymns and rituals of the son’s funeral. Craig’s effective staging confines the action in a succession of cramped domestic interiors but uses video to take us through the streets of Harlem and chart the emergence of the political movements that drive the son on. There are blazing central performances – wonderfully sung and acted with passionate conviction – from Nadine Benjamin and Kenneth Kellogg as the mother and father. Zwakele Tshabalala is touching as the headstrong yet vulnerable son, his arguments frequently carrying the work’s intellectual and ideological weight, while Ronald Samm impresses as the Reverend, struggling to find the means to assuage a grief that is almost beyond comprehension. The smaller roles – two trios, one female, one male – are cast from strength, while Kofi Waldren conducts with considerable commitment and finesse. The playing is exemplary. • At the Coliseum, London, until 4 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T19:38:51Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Liberal to speak out for voice, Wong overruled nuclear treaty advice, Turkey ‘in shock’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/08/morning-mail-liberal-to-speak-out-for-voice-wong-overruled-nuclear-treaty-advice-turkey-in-shock","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone.

The company accompanied its move with feelgood boasts about how it expected to pay £600m under Rishi Sunak’s three-year “energy profits levy” on North Sea oil and gas production. Four months later, there is less bashfulness. Earnings will be “towards the top end of the range” of analysts’ expectations, Thursday’s trading update said, and shareholders can have a much more significant distribution – a buyback of 5% of the share capital, which will cost roughly £250m. The shares rose 6%. Centrica, it seems, will live with the flak – and since its largesse is nothing compared with the oil majors’, you can understand the thinking. But Sunak, let’s hope, read Centrica’s update in detail. The North Sea fields and energy traders are still doing nicely (less so British Gas during warm weather) but an unspecified chunk of the forecast-beating returns are coming from electricity generation. That refers to Centrica’s 20% holding in the UK’s nuclear power stations, a part of the energy industry untouched by the North Sea-only windfall tax. Nuclear, though, is every bit as much of a cash cow currently. Its operating costs haven’t budged but, since the price of electricity is tied to the price of gas, revenues will be through the roof. The government has danced ineffectually around the generation sector for months, pondering price caps and voluntary negotiations to switch projects on to new-era “contracts for difference”, but no solution has yet appeared. It’s time to make a decision. If all the technocratic solutions are deemed to be too fiddly, then it has to be windfall levy. With nuclear, the case is particularly strong because there is no question of creating disincentives to future investment (the grumble from renewables developers). Any future nuclear plant, such as Sizewell C, would be funded by a bespoke financing and pricing model. Centrica, note, will have taken its share buyback decision in full knowledge that some form of levy is likely on nuclear’s windfall returns. And it still thinks it can afford £250m. Sunak should take the hint. Wolfson is right about foreign workers The last time Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, pleaded for the government to allow more foreign workers into the UK, he received a pile of abuse from a prime minister (Boris Johnson) who hadn’t bothered to understand his proposal. The leave-supporting Wolfson wasn’t – and still isn’t – advocating uncontrolled immigration. Rather, he wants a demand-led system that would incentivise UK businesses to hire local workers. Overseas recruits would have to be paid the same as local counterparts, and the employer would pay a 10% surcharge to the Treasury on the wages of foreign-hired labour. “It would automatically mean that businesses never bought someone into the company from outside if they could find someone in the UK,” he said in a BBC interview released on Thursday. “But if they genuinely can’t, they’ll pay the premium.” Last time around, Johnson launched a kneejerk Brexit refrain about British business being addicted to cheap foreign labour, which completely missed the point. A question now, then, is whether the latest inhabitants of Downing Street will engage with the real issue: the lack of flexibility in the UK’s labour market that plainly comes at a cost to growth. Under Liz Truss, there were nods of recognition. The deregulation part of her short-lived agenda contained a push to reform the shortage occupations list to cover, for instance, seasonal agricultural workers and broadband engineers. Where does Sunak stand? We’ll find out (possibly) in next week’s autumn statement, but business lobbyists suspect he’ll be in the Johnson camp. They anticipate no pro-business measures on immigration. If so, it will be another missed opportunity. Wolfson is right that it’s time to move on from tired referendum-era arguments. Hospitals, pubs, restaurants and many other sectors are crying out for a pragmatic approach. His proposal offers a sensible way forward. FTX’s big-name backers exposed As long as they do no harm to the rest of us, crypto punters are free to gamble as much of their money as they wish on their fantasies of alternative asset classes. But the astonishing detail in the implosion at FTX, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange, is that the operation had so many big-name backers.

While Australia was yet to actually join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the shift in its voting position to “abstain” after five years of “no” is seen by campaigners as a sign of progress given the former Coalition government repeatedly sided with the United States against it. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said through a spokesperson that Australia had “a long and proud commitment to the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime” and that the government supported the new treaty’s “ambition of a world without nuclear weapons”. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The previous Coalition government was firmly against the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a relatively new international agreement that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. Australia voted against opening negotiations on the proposed new treaty in late 2016 and did not participate in those talks in 2017. Since 2018 it has voted against annual resolutions at the UN general assembly and first committee that called on all countries to join the agreement “at the earliest possible date”. That changed early on Saturday morning when Australia shifted its voting position to abstain. Indonesia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Ireland were among countries to co-sponsor this year’s supportive UN resolution. Australia traditionally argued the treaty would not work because none of the nuclear weapons states had joined and because it “ignores the realities of the global security environment”. It also argued joining would breach the US alliance obligations, with Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia. But the treaty has gained momentum because of increasing dissatisfaction among activists and non-nuclear states about the outlook for disarmament, given that nuclear weapons states such as the US, Russia and China are in the process of modernising their arsenals. The treaty currently has 91 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it entered into force last year. The Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) had been urging Australia to vote in favour of the UN resolution on Saturday – or at least abstain in order to “end five years of opposition to the TPNW under the previous government”. Three in four members of the Labor caucus – including Anthony Albanese – have signed an Ican pledge that commits parliamentarians “to work for the signature and ratification of this landmark treaty by our respective countries”. Labor’s 2021 national platform committed the party to signing and ratifying the treaty “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. These conditions suggest the barriers to actually signing may still be high. But Gem Romuld, the Australia director of Ican, said the government was “heading in the right direction” and engaging positively with the treaty. Romuld said it “would be completely self-defeating to wait for all nuclear-armed states to get on board” before Australia joined. “Indeed, no disarmament treaty has achieved universal support and Australia has joined all the other disarmament treaties, even where our ally – the US – has not yet signed on, such as the landmine ban treaty,” Romuld said. In 2017 the US, the UK and France declared that they “do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party” to the new treaty, and the Trump administration actively lobbied countries to withdraw. Wong told the UN general assembly last month that Australia would “redouble our efforts” towards disarmament because Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T04:34:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear subs, tax cuts, or money to raise the jobseeker rate – how would you spend Australian tax dollars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Government spending is always contentious, with every choice made being highly political.

The Nationals leader proposes making the grocery code of conduct compulsory, boosting penalties to a “punitive” $10m maximum and adding powers to break up grocery giants in the event of misconduct. In an interview marking one year of the Albanese government, Littleproud told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that the Nationals are a “sovereign party” that will “do our own thing”. Littleproud revealed he has had “initial talks” with the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, about competition law reforms that the Coalition “were moving to [in government] but were too slow”. “The Nationals wanted to move at a lot quicker pace in terms of a compulsory grocery code. The current penalty on breaching the grocery code, which is voluntary for our big supermarkets, is about $64,000 … That’s a cost of doing business. “Let’s have punitive penalties there, $10m plus divesture powers. I think if Woolies or Coles would lose … [alcohol retail business] Dan Murphy’s because they did the wrong thing by a farmer or by a small supplier, that they’d make sure they’re playing within the guidelines of fair and equitable trade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoonemail newsletters for your daily news roundup “Because this is the problem: they have 74% of the retail market. That is a market imbalance and even the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] say that. On Friday, Coles’ supermarkets announced total group sales in the third quarter grew 6.5 per cent to $9.7 billion, with supermarket sales up 7.0 per cent to $8.6b and liquor sales rising 2.6 per cent to $801m. Outgoing CEO Steven Cain attributed the success to Coles’ home brand range, Flybuys points program and weekly special deals. Littleproud said the Nationals would like to work with the government to protect small business. “So I think there’s some reforms there that the Nationals would like to work with the government, to say let’s shift the dial on this, let’s protect small business against big supermarkets. “And it’s only regulatory. So if they’re doing the right thing, Coles, Woolies and Aldi shouldn’t care one iota. “The small supplier and particularly farmers are getting done over and this is where they just need protection. They’re not asking for charity, they’re just asking for a fair price that’s transparent to their cost of production and what it is to get on on to … their shelves and on to your plate.” On Friday the former competition watchdog head Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Leigh said he “[welcomed] bipartisanship in this important area of competition policy” after a decade in which the Coalition presided over “the worst productivity growth in the postwar era”. “As I’ve highlighted in a series of recent speeches, Australia’s economy has become increasingly dominated by a handful of big players,” he said. “Since coming to office, Labor has increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct and banned unfair contract terms. “We’re consulting on banning unfair trading practices and tackling anti-competitive behaviour in specific sectors. We’re also in the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms under the grocery code of conduct.” In a wide-ranging interview, Littleproud said at the 2022 election the Nationals had “lost a lot of voters, and particularly in the cohort of 18- to 54-year-old women and young people”. Littleproud suggested the Nationals could re-engage with these voters by advocating for childcare accessibility, regional health, and committing that “we are serious about net zero and about how we achieve it”. Littleproud echoed opposition leader Peter Dutton’s call for an investigation of small-scale modular nuclear power to help firm electricity from renewables, which the Albanese government has ruled out on cost and feasibility grounds. Littleproud defended the Nationals’ decision to come out in November in opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. In contrast to Dutton’s claims that the voice proposal lacked detail, Littleproud said “the detail has been there for some time about the principle that the prime minister would be putting to the Australian people”. Littleproud argued that Australia doesn’t “need a bigger bureaucracy, you just need a better one” to help narrow the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health and social outcomes. “The thing that I’m most disappointed in all this is that there is no ambitious goal to say, as a nation, that we will have closed the gap by 2030, 2035.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-14T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"A key lesson from the Niger crisis: Africans, not global powers, will plot the continent’s path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","fields":{"bodyText":"A “coup belt” now extends across the African continent, running along the Sahel region that bisects north and sub-Saharan Africa. On 10 August, Niger, where the democratically elected president was deposed by a military junta, became the last link that completed the corridor of countries run by coupsters. It is the ninth coup or attempted power grab in west and central Africa since 2020. This might appear at first glance as a retrenchment, the thrusting of African countries back into military rule and weak democratic cultures, with a dash of Russian mischief to complete the picture of a fragile region at the whim of local strongmen and meddling. The reality is much more complicated, and perhaps even oddly hopeful. Let’s first address that which is not entirely true. Much has been made of Russian intervention in the region, primarily through the activities of the Wagner group. Wagner, in terms of troop deployment, is indeed present in Africa, but only concentrated in a few countries: Central African Republic, Mali and Libya. The rest of Wagner’s active military presence is fluid and inconsistent in loyalty, as mercenary deployment often is: providing support, arms and training to governments and insurgencies alike. The organisation’s main concern appears to be a sort of economic piracy, forging partnerships with local militias and governments to extract and skim off the yield of natural resources: gold in Sudan, oil in Libya, diamonds and uranium in Central African Republic. To achieve these ends, Wagner deploys not just firepower and manpower, but nestles within the soft power of the Russian state. All Eyes on Wagner, a project that tracks the outfit’s activities through open source information and witness accounts, told me that Wagner is assisted by the Russian non-profit organisation the Foundation for National Values Protection, which claims to monitor perceptions of government among the citizenry so as to better shape and “get a feel” for what works in certain countries. The result is that Wagner is skilled in the sort of propaganda and targeted local outreach that portrays it as the representative of benign foreign powers, a contrast to the US and ex-colonial European forces. “A gift from Yevgeny Prigozhin” is how food parcels of rice, sugar and lentils distributed to poor people are labelled. Two weeks ago, Putin proposed to liberate African countries from neocolonialism. In Niger, pro-coup demonstrators assembled waving Russian flags and chanting “down with France”. This is not to understate Wagner’s and by extension Russia’s influence, but these are enablers, rather than causes, of the spate of coups since 2020. And their presence galvanises US attention and diplomatic scrambling, further establishing the impression that these coups are somehow proxy skirmishes for power on the part of foreign regimes, obscuring the real dynamics on the ground. That perspective of Africa as merely a weak link in the global security chain has also overemphasised Islamic terrorism in the Sahel as a contributing factor. The presence of jihadist groups in the region has historically elicited a classically narrow militarised response from western powers that have deployed troops in Niger and greater west Africa. But this provides no solution for, or understanding of, the fact that increased terrorist activity, like the coups themselves, is a symptom of demographic and economic trends across the region rather than a primary trigger for democratic instability. Which brings us to the varied reasons behind these coups. Unsettling as they are to foreign interests, they are, for the most part, hyperlocal and a long time coming. Weak states, strong military and paramilitary forces, the climate crisis that has disrupted ways of living and a demographic bulge that has resulted in large populations of young people with poor economic prospects, all combine to empower government takeover and sow widespread despair and a sense of loss of agency that young, charismatic strongmen can exploit. It is easy to collapse these reasons into the fatalistic conclusion that parts of Africa that share these patterns are simply condemned to cycles of violence. But often these structural problems sit alongside homegrown efforts to build and nurture democracy that endure, despite the challenges. Niger itself was a good news story, with its now deposed president coming to power in a democratic election in 2021 that was Niger’s first peaceful transition of power since independence, one that successfully saw off a coup attempt before the president took office. In Sudan, on the far east of the coup belt, a popular uprising against Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year dictatorship agitated so hard for civilian governance that a 2021 coup was launched to forestall that popular demand and proceeded to cut off Sudan from the rest of the world and hobble its economy, before plunging the country into war between different military factions. The result is the hopeful prospect, even though it may not seem like it, of coups no longer being allowed to pass as business as usual on the continent. There is a realisation among heads of state and regional organisations that democratic governments must be encouraged – the normalisation of overthrowing democratically elected governments by force creates a contagion effect and is disruptive to all of the continent’s prospects. As it stands, the airspace of Libya in the north of Africa, Niger in the west and Sudan in the east is closed to commercial flights, creating a triangle that cargo and passenger traffic must thread. Over the past three months, air traffic into Africa from Europe has been forced to recalibrate flight paths twice, as countries became unsafe to fly over. The stakes are high, no longer just when it comes to security, but economic stability. The outcome of these continent-wide risks is that the Niger coup has drawn a response from Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States), which is unprecedented. The organisation has threatened military action if the coup is not reversed. A meeting to thrash out details of that on Saturday was cancelled. But the threat, and the resolutely strong censure, remain. Last week, after the coupsters refused to stand down, hoping that Ecowas would blink first, west African leaders activated standby forces, with President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria warning that “no option is taken off the tables”. “If we don’t do it,” he said, “no one else will do it for us” – a clear-eyed declaration that Moscow, Washington, Paris and London have nothing to offer African countries and that their concerns for democracy ring hollow as they do little but pursue narrow interests in the region. It is “an unavoidable reality”, writes veteran Africa correspondent Howard French, that “Africans will ultimately make or break their continent’s geopolitical landscape – and foreign interlopers, however muscle-bound they may appear, are ultimately fated to play a secondary role.” Amid stale cold war framings, western military calculations about jihadist contagion and fretting about loss of influence on the part of ex-colonial powers, Niger’s coup and those that preceded it may in fact plot a path to a future in which it finally becomes clear that Africa’s stability will not be forged in the Pentagon or on heated analysis panels on cable news, but on its own terms and through its own mechanisms, once it faces its worst fears and opts for self-preservation.

Now the film is contending with more darts. Sir Michael Caine is furious at the news that Zulu, the 1964 film about the battle of Rorke’s Drift that made him an international star, has been named as something that could encourage far-right sympathies by the Research Information and Communications Unit, run as part of Prevent, the government’s counter-terror operation. As if to troll Sir Michael and everyone else, the unit includes on its list The Four Feathers, The Great Escape and The Dam Busters – the last one perhaps because of the name that Wing Commander Guy Gibson gives his dog. (To quote the explanation given by David Brent, “it was before racism was bad”.) But the list also includes works by Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Kipling and Edmund Burke as well as The Thick of It, Yes Minister and Michael Portillo’s Great British Railway Journeys. (Maybe we’ll let them have that last one.) But is Prevent really trying to get Zulu and all these other texts cancelled? Or is it merely recording the (perhaps mischievous) way that far-right groups solemnly invoke these things as touchstones? And could it be that Prevent’s clumsy list will cause people to watch Zulu all over again, to get a new generation to see Stanley Baker, that lion of British cinema who played Caine’s commanding officer Lt John Chard, and of course Caine himself, playing a stiff-upper-lipped posh type for the first and last time in his life? There is also Jack Hawkins as the alcoholic civilian missionary who is evacuated in a truck screaming: “You’re all going to die! Don’t you realise? Can’t you see?” It’s certainly a tricky watch, with the concept of empire now being re-examined. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift happened during the Anglo-Zulu War, caused by Britain’s invasion of Zululand in 1879. The combatants’ manpower on both sides might be said to have been about equal but the British had the cannons, breechloading rifles and Gatling guns. The Zulus were defending an unprovoked attack on their territory by an invader with superior weaponry. But the film Zulu claimed underdog status for the British by focussing on a specific event in which just 150 British soldiers held off around 4,000 Zulu warriors. The movie sentimentally imagines a final standoff in which the British and Zulus actually sing to each other, imbued with respect for each other’s martial gallantry: the Zulus a funeral lament and the British a chorus of Men of Harlech. Did director Cy Endfield consider a game of football between them on no man’s land? The movie doesn’t exactly provide the overall context: this was part of a catastrophic reverse for the British, taking into account the previous Battle of Isandlwana – to which Rorke’s Drift was a footnote – in which they were defeated despite their weaponry advantage. After Rorke’s Drift, moreover, some Zulus were hanged using a specially constructed gallows. The movie is arguably part of the cover-up mythology that began almost immediately: the seizing on and inflation of a relatively unimportant event. Undoubtedly the look and feel of Zulu inspired a film that does not feature on the Prevent list: Carry On Up the Khyber, that well-known satire of British colonialism. Perhaps the Research Information and Communications Unit could host a double-bill of these films at the Home Office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T17:41:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 188 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were shelling ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow was using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces had taken back four villages near Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main target being Kherson. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fire in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply. Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russia officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have been reported to have failed in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another vessel carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team would visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the UN nuclear watchdog inspectors to reach the Zaporizhzhia plant. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the IAEA mission through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Zaporizhzhia plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventive safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counterproductive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to punish Russia for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed the French utility company Engie that it is reducing its gas deliveries owing to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in the war, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it was likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase in size by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting from January next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-24T08:28:11Z","webTitle":"New Icac powers spark concerns as NSW opposition flags move to stop ‘reckless’ change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","fields":{"bodyText":"Special powers handed to the New South Wales corruption watchdog to use illegally obtained recordings have been described as “concerning”, with the opposition and members of the crossbench vowing to try to stop them from proceeding. The government granted the powers to the Independent Commission Against Corruption on Wednesday to assist it with an ongoing investigation in response to a request from its chief commissioner, John Hatzistergos. A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the request was made after the commission found illegal recordings as part of its investigation into the Sydney developer and fugitive Jean Nassif, his company Toplace and branch stacking. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said on Thursday he would work to stop or change the powers to ensure they could apply to just the one Icac investigation. “This is reckless drafting. It should have been subject to proper scrutiny of parliament where we could have finessed the drafting … but this hasn’t been done,” he said. “You have an Icac and a government that have made this reckless and outrageous and outlandish and over-the-top power grab.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The former supreme court judge Anthony Whealy KC said the powers should be used sparingly and transparently. “As a one-off, it’s tolerable, but the idea that authorities can get access to illegally obtained intercepts is rather concerning,” he said. “The power has been exercised or is about to be exercised transparently. That is, at least we all know that this power has been specially conferred, so that’s a good thing. “I would like to see it used only sparingly and in exceptional cases.” Whealy, who also serves as the chair for the Centre for Public Integrity, said there would likely be problems if a matter was referred from Icac to the director of public prosecutions if the initial case involved illegally collected phone taps. “In a criminal prosecution, I think they’d be hard-pressed to get admitted into evidence,” he said. The Liberal Democrats upper house member, John Ruddick, will attempt to garner support from other MPs over the next two weeks to overturn the new power when parliament returns for its next sitting fortnight. “It will provide an incentive for people to take secret recordings of phone calls with … all sorts of enemies and hand them over to Icac and this is appalling. “I’d be prepared to pay the cost of having a few criminals going free for the rest of us to have more civil liberties.” Ruddick said it would “come down to the Greens” to achieve the simple majority required to block the new power. Hatzistergos wrote to the premier, Chris Minns, the special minister of state, John Graham, and the attorney general, Michael Daley, on 9 August. According to a statement by Graham and Daley, Hatzistergos’s letter “indicated” that Icac had obtained evidence that appeared to be recordings of private conversations made by a third party. “In his letter, the chief commissioner advised that the Icac wishes to lawfully obtain, possess, publish and communicate the recordings and reports of the recordings as part of an ongoing investigation,” the statement read. The government has given Icac an exemption through a regulatory change, which is different to legislation in that it did not require the majority support of parliament to be enacted. The powers will automatically be revoked at the end of 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T18:59:25Z","webTitle":"Howard ministers considered extinguishing native title over SA site earmarked for nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"bodyText":"John Howard’s government considered extinguishing native title over a South Australian site earmarked for a nuclear waste dump “by agreement or by compulsory acquisition”, the 2002 cabinet papers reveal. The records, released on Sunday by the National Archives of Australia, shed light on the Howard government’s part in the decades-long battle to create a national storage site for Australia’s low- and medium-level nuclear waste. The Keating government began searching for a site to store the nation’s nuclear waste as early as 1992. In 2012 the Gillard government passed a controversial bill to create the nation’s first nuclear waste dump – saying it hadn’t yet decided on a location, although many believed it was destined for remote Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Now preliminary works have started on a site at Napandee, near Kimba in South Australia, after the Morrison government resources minister Keith Pitt declared native title had been extinguished there. The legal and political obstacles were apparent in 2002 when the finance minister, Nick Minchin, and science minister, Peter McGauran, brought their submission to cabinet. They proposed that federal laws should be used to override SA laws that would ban the establishment of a dump, and that Indigenous land use agreements could be used to override native title. If native title parties had not “agreed to the surrender of their native title through an ILUA”, the government should consider compulsory acquisition, they said. Cabinet noted that “the extinguishing of native title, whether by agreement or by compulsory acquisition, is likely to raise difficult issues”. The cabinet submission noted there were “strong imperatives” for “the safe keeping of hazardous radioactive waste materials” that arise from medicine, industry and research. The waste is now stored at Lucas Heights outside Sydney, and more than 100 institutions across the country. “Given the sensitivity of the project and the need for certainty of tenure that provides exclusive use of the site for the duration of the project, there appears to be no practical alternative to the extinguishment of native title,” the submission said. But the government would need to provide “benefits” in return, and be prepared for legal challenges. The submission also suggested a media strategy, saying that ruling out having intermediate waste (leaving just low-level waste) would “deprive the SA government of the argument the national repository was the thin end of the wedge, and that the government has a hidden agenda to site the national intermediate waste store in the state”. The current government plan is to use the Napandee site as permanent storage for low-level waste, and temporary storage for intermediate-level waste (the long-term plan for the intermediate waste is not clear). The prime minister’s department agreed with the 2002 plan, while the Attorney General’s Department supported it, but said there was not enough information to work out whether “security measures will be sufficient to prevent access to the repository for the purpose of terrorist or other criminal activity”. The Department of Foreign Affairs warned of the “distinct” possibility of “dirty bombs”, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. A dirty bomb is where an explosive is used to scatter radioactive dust. The Department of Defence had “serious concerns” about the initial proposal to use Woomera for storage. “A principal concern is the risk of a weapon impact on the national repository as well as the negative publicity that would result,” the department said. The traditional owners of the Napandee site, the Barngarla people, are still fighting the federal government in court. The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, has said he supports their cause. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, has said the waste “cannot continue to build up”, and has committed to working with the Barngarla people to protect the site’s cultural heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"Best podcasts of the week: Trans moshpits, non-binary emo and the power of music for queer lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","fields":{"bodyText":"Picks of the week Dinner’s on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson Widely available, episodes weekly In this lofi podcast, the Modern Family star uses his contacts to bag freebie meals in New York and LA for a new guest each week.

HV There’s a podcast for that This week, Ammar Kalia chooses five of the best niche podcasts, from a deep dive into the written works of Jane Austen to a podcast about the humble pen itself Beach Too Sandy, Water Too Wet There is no better way to plumb the depths of obscurity than to go searching for negative reviews of strange products and places online. This long-running podcast from siblings Alex and Christine Schiefer pays hilarious tribute to the niche world of one-star reviews, providing dramatic readings of everything from screeds against suburban branches of Hooters restaurants in the US to dud strands of weed, caves, matchmaking services, and wedding chapels. It is as much an exploration into the psyche of the people who feel compelled to leave reviews as it is an unearthing of the unusual places and things they experience. Centuries of Sound Since sound recording began in the 19th century, sonic traces of our history have ranged from changing styles of music to recorded speeches, radio broadcasts and the simple bustle of background noise. British sound artist James Errington has been compiling this audio archive since starting his podcast in 2017, making immersive sound mixes of music, chatter and atmosphere for each year from the 1850s onwards. While discursive interludes provide context for the mixes, the audio itself is an engrossing guide, placing listeners directly back in the time of the music and sound’s making. The Pen Addict We might spend most of our lives glued to screens and tapping at keyboards, but there is still a satisfying pleasure in putting pen to paper and scratching away. At least, that’s the premise for this stationery-themed podcast, hosted by aficionados Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley. The pair guide listeners through the latest developments in fountain pen technology, paper stock and ballpoint design in each episode. While it might sound yawn-inducing, the show’s attention to detail is strangely fascinating; from the rarefied world of collectors to what your handwriting says about you, there’s more to our writing implements than meets the eye. The Thing About Austen A historical podcast with an ingenious route into its 18th- and 19th-century periods of study, this series from literary academics Zan Cammack and Diane Neu examines the world that surrounded the novels written by Jane Austen (pictured above). Much more than just an exploration of genteel society and marriage comedies, Cammack and Neu’s wide-ranging and gleefully nerdy discussions drill down into the smallest details from Austen’s popular texts, from Sense and Sensibility’s toothpick cases to Northanger Abbey’s muslin. By raking through Austen’s objects, Cammack and Neu discover the writer’s ingenuity and what her characters’ possessions ultimately reveal about their time and place.

But north-east Baden-Württemberg boasts several successful specialist firms which make up the Mittelstand, the base of small and medium-sized engineering businesses that are the backbone of the German economy and are envied around the world. The fan and ventilator manufacturer ebm-papst is still headquartered in Mulfingen – a town with a population of about 3,600 – but its products are found all over the world in cars, household appliances and datacentres. However, the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, combined with labour shortages and post-pandemic disruption to supply chains, is piling pressure on these businesses, which are traditionally family-owned – and without the deep pockets enjoyed by Germany’s corporate giants. With Germany braced for recession this year, how this industrial heartland responds and adapts to the multiple crises will help shape not just the country’s future but wider eurozone, too. Germany is forecast to be the third worst-performing G20 country (-0.3%) this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Russia and the UK. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of Germany’s economy, more than double 9% seen in the UK and France, and well ahead of Italy’s 15%. The biggest industrial employer in the region, about 4,000 work for ebm-papst in Mulfingen, the majority producing fans and motors for ventilation, refrigeration and air-conditioning technology. Founded in 1963 by Gerhard Sturm, the company, which calls itself a “hidden champion”, remains family-owned but has been run for the last year by the chief executive, Klaus Geißdörfer. Under his leadership, the company decided to end the production of fans for cars. Instead it has switched staff to focus on new technologies, such as making ventilators for heat pumps and fans to cool datacentres. “We said that we’d better focus on the things where we really are the best in the world,” says Geißdörfer from his office at ebm-papst’s headquarters. “We decided to significantly increase our capacities, which we will ramp up next year, because at the moment we are not able to follow demand.” Despite profiting from booming sales in fans for renewable technologies, the past few years have not been plain sailing for ebm-papst. Covid lockdowns in China and the resulting supply chain disruption occasionally brought its German production lines to a halt, which Geißdörfer says “makes no sense”. As a result, the company has worked to source more parts locally, close to its big factories in Germany, as well as in the US and China. Just down the road in this economic heartland are the headquarters of the almost 80-year-old screw and fastener maker Würth, which sits near Bürkert, a manufacturer of measurement and control systems for liquids and gases. These companies have helped south Germany become an industrial powerhouse, bringing prosperity and a sense of local pride to the area. “The region has lots of world market leaders,” says Donata Lell, who runs a local guesthouse and restaurant. She believes the industrial base boosts her customers’ spending power: “People here earn more money.” Geißdörfer, who hails from neighbouring Bavaria, is convinced the small community of Mulfingen is a good place to run a manufacturing business. “We have smart people here. I like the spirit people have here, they are very enthusiastic,” he says. But does the company have enough of those people for it to meet growing demand? Despite Geißdörfer’s positivity, ebm-papst has difficulties finding staff with the right skills, as well as problems getting hold of components, such as semiconductors. Ebm-papst has tried to solve its worker shortage by offering some remote working to staff in administrative roles, plus free bus travel to work for employees who live within a 40km (25 mile) radius, a perk currently used by about 1,500 people. Amid the company’s cost pressures, and higher prices demanded by its suppliers, staff say they are struggling with the cost of living crisis. Employees on the factory floor have raised their personal financial difficulties directly with Geißdörfer. “I had people coming to me and saying ‘I cannot buy any Christmas presents for my children any more’,” he says. “I talk to people, and they say, ‘I cannot afford vacations any more’.” During the summer the company paid staff an extra €2,500 in cost of living payments, made in five monthly €500 instalments from October onwards. “We stay close together with our people, and we support them in tough times and we go through crises together and try to find a way to handle it,” Geißdörfer says, describing this as a strength of the Mittelstand. “That’s the positive thing with this kind of family business structure we have in Germany. I see also other companies doing similar things.” Yet that might not be enough. The IG Metall metalworkers’ trade union, the country’s largest, already represents workers at ebm-papst’s other manufacturing sites in Germany, but not at its main site in Mulfingen, as a result of a historic work agreement. It is working to get its foot in the door there too, says Uwe Bauer, IG Metall’s representative for the Schwäbisch Hall region. Bauer says the union has recruited several hundred members in Mulfingen in recent months, as workers realise full employment locally has created “an employees’ market”. “Businesses have to rethink what to do about skilled workers,” Bauer says. “We get a lot of requests about which companies are bound by collective wage agreements. Wages play a role, but so do regular working hours,” Bauer says. Ebm-papst’s pay offer nationally is broadly in line with the collective wage agreement deal struck between IG Metall and employers in Baden-Württemberg in late November, although the workers in Mulfingen are not subject to this agreement. The pay deal, which sets the benchmark for wage increases for almost 4m metal and electrical sector workers across Germany, increases workers’ wages by 5.2% from June and 3.3% from May 2024. In addition, they will also receive a €3,000 “inflation bonus”, as the union calls it, which is tax-free and payable in two instalments in March 2023 and 2024. The agreement is generous by historical standards, but still drew some criticism for coming in below inflation, when the annual rate stood at 10% in November, according to official statistics. While pay matters are settled for now, sourcing parts remains a challenge amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips since the start of the pandemic. In the race to obtain these vital components, Mittelstand firms find themselves unable to compete financially with the country’s largest manufacturers, particularly carmakers. “As a company we can grow faster if we can get more semiconductors,” says Geißdörfer. “Somehow, we compete. But the industry is competing with the automotive industry, the solar industry and the renewable energy industry, and we all need the same kind of electronics.” The government should do more to support the country’s vital network of small and medium-sized companies, he says, particularly with soaring energy costs, which Geißdörfer believes are making European companies globally uncompetitive compared with Asian or American rivals. Recent falls in wholesale energy prices have offered only a glimmer of hope. “I really have worries about German smaller and mid-sized companies that heavily depend on energy. They have real problems at the moment to work to face those huge energy costs increases.” While he welcomes government support with energy bills, Geißdörfer and other Mittelstand bosses fear Berlin does not have a clear industrial strategy, particularly while it weans the country off cheap Russian gas. Angela Merkel’s government’s decision to turn off its nuclear power plants after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan has left it exposed to the Kremlin’s weaponisation of gas. “In Germany, we need to reinvent ourselves,” says Geißdörfer, acknowledging the geopolitical challenges, including the energy transition, and Brexit. “We are still strong enough to have sufficient money and we can afford it, but we need to do this fast, to think about how to have a stable economy going forward. But it is one minute before midnight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T14:44:28Z","webTitle":"Harrison Birtwistle tribute – music of power and beauty as Sinfonietta remember a great friendship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/mar/06/harrison-birtwistle-tribute-music-of-power-and-beauty-as-sinfonietta-remember-a-great-friendship","fields":{"bodyText":"The relationship between Harrison Birtwistle and the London Sinfonietta spanned more than half a century, and took in more than 30 premieres and performances in 28 countries. The orchestra’s tribute to the great composer, who died 11 months ago, was generous and sincere – a concert conducted by Martyn Brabbins that included both the first and last of the large-scale ensemble works that the Sinfonietta introduced, and which also involved musicians from the Manson Ensemble of the Royal Academy of Music, where Birtwistle studied clarinet in the late 1950s, a connection that he renewed at the end of his life. And, with the news of the sudden death three days earlier of Nicholas Snowman, co-founder of the Sinfonietta, who was a close friend of Birtwistle and a steadfast champion of his music, the occasion had taken on an extra poignancy. Snowman in fact commissioned the earliest piece in this programme, Verses for Ensembles, which the Sinfonietta first performed in 1969. With its block-like construction, raw, uncompromising soundworld of wind instruments and percussion, and mysterious elements of ritual as the instrumentalists move around the platform, Verses remains in many respects the archetypal Birtwistle score, and, as Brabbins’s performance showed, it has lost none of its excoriating power, derived in large part from its debts to Stravinsky and Varèse. Birtwistle observed that he always felt he was composing the same piece, exploring different facets in turn of one block of musical material, but how his music evolved was shown by the ensemble piece here from the other end of his career, In Broken Images, from 2011. The musical blocks by then have smoother edges, their rawness is tempered by a group of strings, and the argument is less static, more in a continuous process of development, while its rhetorical power remains intact. On occasions like this, one always wants to hear more pieces than a single concert can contain, but it seemed a pity that the programme began with a couple of miniatures, the “conversation for two instruments” Duet 1, and Virelai, an arrangement of a 14th-century work by Johannes Ciconia, rather than a more muscular piece. There was room however for one of Birtwistle’s most beautiful scores, The Fields of Sorrow, a setting of a brief Latin text by Ausonius for two sopranos (Abigail Sinclair and Lisa Dafydd) and chamber choir (Londinium), with two pianos and the inevitable wind instruments creating fragile, mysterious textures around them. Here, between the more strident pieces, were a few minutes of perfect tranquillity. This article was amended on 9 March. The word ‘fulsome’ was changed to ‘generous’."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:21:30Z","webTitle":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia appeared close to taking control of Bakhmut on Monday, although Ukraine said it continued to fight on in the south-west fringes of the city largely devastated by an intense year of deadly fighting. Hanna Mailar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine still controlled “certain facilities” in the Litak district, but reports said the defenders had lost control of the last of the remaining high-rises in the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukraine has switched its primary focus to engaging in limited counterattacks on the higher ground to the immediate north-west and south of the ruined city, which could be used to threaten the Russian attackers below. “The offensive potential of the enemy has been significantly reduced, huge losses have been inflicted on the enemy” Mailar said. She added: “We have gained time for certain actions, which will be discussed later.” Bakhmut was first shelled in May 2022 and Russian forces consistently targeted the mining city that had a pre-war population of about 70,000. Although not considered of particular strategic value, the city has acquired a high symbolic value for both sides in the conflict. The two sides fought building by building in the most intense fighting seen in Europe since the end of the second world war, with Russia taking a year to advance about 24km on the Bakhmut sector of the eastern Donbas, a front that has otherwise remained relatively static since last autumn. The effort was led by the Russian mercenary Wagner group, using seasoned veterans to command a large number of former prisoners. But experts question whether, as the battle draws to an end, Wagner can continue to fight further. The Institute of the Study of War said on Sunday night it believed Wagner’s offensive was likely to be at its culmination point and that “it is unlikely that Wagner will continue fighting beyond Bakhmut at its current depleted state”. Joe Biden, the US president, said at the G7 summit in Japan that Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, killed and wounded, in fighting for the city, higher than previous Ukrainian estimates of 70,000. Ukraine does not release casualty figures but it is believed to have lost tens of thousands in the protracted struggle. Wagner’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declared on Saturday that Bakhmut had fallen, filming himself at the city’s battered railway station a few kilometres behind the frontline. Other video footage showed Russian troops waving flags at the western edge of the city, although not in the Litak district still being fought over. At that point, Prigozhin announced Wagner forces would withdraw from the city by Thursday, leaving its defence to regular Russian troops, although it was unclear whether that was a firm declaration of intent, or a feint designed to lure Ukrainian forces back into attacking the city. Attacking forces are often considered at their most vulnerable when an advance culminates, usually due to combat exhaustion, and Ukraine has been hinting that it hopes to surround the invaders in the city by attacking to the north and south. But the Ukrainian counterattacks remain relatively limited so far, and the expectation is that Kyiv will soon launch a more significant assault as the weather improves, using about 12 brigades-worth of troops, many of which have been equipped with western tanks, fighting vehicles and artillery. Three civilians were killed and 14 injured across Ukraine in overnight shelling while the country’s air force said it had shot down four cruise missiles and 20 drones. But the air force spokesperson Yuri Inhat said Ukraine did not “have enough means” – air defences – to deal with high-speed ballistic missiles across the country. Ukraine said it had reconnected the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its external power supply after a brief outage that had left it reliant on emergency generators.

Australia will spend $9bn over the next four years. From this year Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with US and UK navies, including within both countries’ submarine industrial bases. From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate their nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling near Perth as part of a push to step up training of Australians. The imperative Increased Chinese naval power and assertiveness – particularly in the South China Sea – has convinced the Australian government that it requires submarines capable of operating far from home bases, both as a deterrent and for attack capability in the event of a crisis. The current fleet of Collins class conventional submarines are expected to lose their edge from the 2030s. Nuclear-powered submarines have a distinct advantage over the diesel-electric boats of Australia’s fleet because they don’t need to surface to “snort” to recharge their batteries. Nuclear subs can leave port and stay underwater for weeks, avoiding detection. Four phases 1. Embedded personnel and port visits: Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with the the allies’ navies. US nuclear-powered submarines will increase their visits to Australian ports, with Australian sailors joining US crews for training. 2. Submarine rotations: From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines through HMAS Stirling. 3. Sale of US Virginia-class submarines: From the early 2030s – pending approval by Congress – the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines, with a potential option for two more if required. 4. SSN-Aukus: A combination of UK submarine design and US defence technology will contribute to the development of the new SSN-Aukus submarine – intended as the future attack submarine for both the UK and Australia. Both Australia and the UK intend to start building SSN-Aukus submarines in their domestic shipyards before the end of this decade. The first such boat may enter into UK service in the late 2030s, but the Australian navy will receive its first Australian-built SSN-Aukus submarine in the early 2040s. Australia will begin construction works on the shipyard required to build nuclear-powered submarines in Osborne, South Australia, this year. The US Joe Biden said the three nations stood at an “inflection point in history” argued that in “forging this new partnership, we’re showing again how democracies can deliver, how our own security and prosperity and not just for us, but for the entire world”. The US president stressed – repeatedly – that the submarines that will be part of the Aukus deal will be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state and it’s committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them.” Australia Australia’s prime minister said the Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between Australia, the US and the UK. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Anthony Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. China China responded to the announcement by saying the nuclear submarine cooperation plan was “a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region”. “The irony of Aukus is that two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state, clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT [non-proliferation treaty],” China’s mission to the UN tweeted. Nuclear waste The nuclear reactors that will power the SSN-Aukus submarines will not be built in Australia. They will arrive from either the UK or US in a welded power unit and will not require refuelling during their expected lifetime. Australia has said it will not enrich uranium or reprocess any spent fuel from the submarines. But it has committed to managing all of the radioactive waste generated by the submarines within Australia. “This includes radioactive waste with lower levels of radioactivity generated by day-to-day submarine operations and maintenance,” a government fact sheet says. “And radioactive waste with higher levels of radioactivity, including spent fuel, which is produced when submarines are decommissioned at the end of their service life.” No decision has been made on the location yet. Nuclear non-proliferation concerns The Aukus scheme is the first time a provision in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. Paragraph 14 allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium – the core of a nuclear weapon – from international oversight. James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there was “real and concrete harm done” to the non-proliferation regime. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.” The Winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Australia’s decision to buy and build nuclear-powered submarines was both a major proliferation risk and could be seen internationally as a precursor to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Ican urged Australia to sign the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons: the ban Ican has championed and to which 68 states around the world are now a party. The Australian government counters that it has no intention of seeking nuclear weapons, and adds: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” Jobs The Australian government estimates the nuclear submarine program will need 20,000 jobs over the next 30 years, within the ADF, the domestic ship-building industry and the public service. The government forecasts 8,500 will be directly employed in Australia’s building and servicing of the submarines, including scientists, engineers, project managers, construction workers, electricians, fitters and builders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T01:51:49Z","webTitle":"UN calls for demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,” Grossi said. Guterres said that, as a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces should cease all military operations around the plant. “As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he added. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offered qualified support for Grossi’s proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the plant and asked for more detail on the plan. “If the content of this proposal is to demilitarise the territory of the nuclear power plant – and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarised protection zone,” he said. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, blamed recent shelling of the plant on Ukraine and portrayed Russian forces as protecting the plant. He did not respond to the call for a security zone, a proposal Moscow has so far rejected. Nebenzya said he had not had time to read the IAEA report. The IAEA report presented on Tuesday said the agency was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. The report came as a Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. “Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainewas behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. At least two Ukrainians collaborating with the Russian government were killed in suspected partisan attacks in August. In one case, the deputy head of the Russian-installed military administration was shot to death in his home in the city of Nova Kakhovka. In late August, a Ukrainian politician from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party who had gone over to work with the Russians was killed in the Kherson region. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the security council the Zaporizhzhia staff were “no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.” Russian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity, prompting fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility and the report did not ascribe blame for the damage its inspectors had discovered. The UN agency sent a 14-person team to the site last week, including its director general, Rafael Grossi, to assess the situation at the plant. At least two members of the team are to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility’s safety. “There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said. “This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities.” The IAEA said that, during its inspection, its team “closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant, in particular on 3 September when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the administrative building”. On the same day, the plant was disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line. “While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. Grossi is expected to brief the UN security council in New York on his findings later on Tuesday. Earlier, blasts rang out and power was cut in Enerhodar, the city surrounding the plant, according to Dmytro Orlov, the Ukrainian mayor who operates from outside Russian-held territory. Moscow repeated its longstanding accusations that Ukrainian forces had been shelling the plant. Kyiv says it is Russia that has been staging such incidents, to undermine international support for Ukraine and as a possible pretext to cut the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and steal its output. On the battleground in the east of the country on Tuesday, three civilians were killed in Russian rocket attacks in the Kharkiv region, a senior official said. In the past week the focus of fighting has shifted to the south, where Ukraine has started a long-awaited counterattack to recapture territory seized early in the war. Ukrainian officials posted an image online of three soldiers raising Ukraine’s flag on a rooftop in Vysokopyllya, in the north of Kherson. If confirmed, it could mark perhaps the most strategic breakthrough on the battlefield in the counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T18:17:09Z","webTitle":"Biden denounces Putin’s nuclear threats as ‘reckless’ in UN address","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s partial mobilisation and planned annexation of more Ukrainian regions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also shrugged off Putin’s moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counter-offensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. “We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Zelenskiy said in a pre-recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly, which Russia had tried to stop but was overwhelmingly voted down by member states. “Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine … It wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilisation at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war because it will be even hotter than the war now.” Both Biden and Zelenskiy sought to deepen Russia’s isolation, on a day when North Korea said it would not supply ammunition to Russian forces. In his speech to the general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called “reckless” threats and “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that Moscow had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. A senior US administration official said the US would not lessen its commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. The official said Putin’s latest actions were an “act of weakness” that showed his “desperation”. “This is another episode in what has been a series of episodes over the course of this war where Putin is trying to rattle his sabre trying to scare us off,” the senior official said. “He has not succeeded before – he won’t succeed now, but that doesn’t mean that we’re blind to the dynamics that could relate to escalation and that we weren’t thinking carefully through in close consultation with our allies and with Ukrainians how we would deal with that.” Biden portrayed the Russian leader and his “imperial ambitions” as a threat to the founding values of the UN, seeking to consolidate Ukraine’s global support and coax some developing countries away from their neutral stance, as Putin raised the stakes. “This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,” Biden said. “Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.” In his speech, Zelenskiy reminded world leaders of the mass graves being exhumed in the recently liberated town of Izium as the general assembly gathered, saying that among the bodies was a man strangled with a rope, and another who had been castrated before the murder. The Ukrainian president said that was not the first of such atrocities. He told the global assembly: “Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?” As Zelenskiy was speaking, a rare bit of good news emerged from the conflict: a prisoner swap in which Russia released 215 Ukrainian soldiers – many of whom had fought a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol in May – in exchange for 55 Russians and Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and oligarch who had taken sides with the Russian invaders. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, thanked the Ukrainian government for including two US citizens among 10 foreign fighters it asked to be freed as part of the swap, and also thanked Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for facilitating the deal. The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, dismissed Putin’s threats, telling the UN assembly late on Wednesdy: “We have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. “He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.” Earlier on Wednesday, Putin had delivered a highly anticipated televised address to declare a “partial mobilisation”, which he claimed was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which he said wanted “to destroy our country” and was trying to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that will apply to “those with previous military experience”. The announcement triggered an exodus of Russian men scrambling to avoid the draft. Air tickets rose in price and were soon sold out. Russian opposition groups called for nationwide anti-war street protests and by Wednesday evening, more than 1,300 people had been arrested at the demonstrations, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info. “Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation is an act of desperation,” the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Twitter. “Russia cannot win this criminal war. Putin has underestimated the situation from the outset – including the will to resist of Ukraine and the resolve shown by its friends.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there had been no perceived change in the deployment Russian nuclear forces. “The most important thing is to prevent that from happening, and that’s the reason why we have been so clear in our communications with Russia about the unprecedented consequences, about the fact that the nuclear war cannot be won by Russia,” Stoltenberg told Reuters. Putin’s announcement came a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold “referendums” this weekend on becoming part of Russia. In his speech, Putin gave support to those ballots in the parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia runder Russian control. He also delivered barely veiled nuclear threats against Nato, saying: “I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of Nato countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal.” Putin added: “It’s not a bluff.” The Russian leader and his senior officials have made a string of similar nuclear threats since launching the invasion in February, in an effort to deter Nato countries from intervening. But in his UN speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to make clear the US and its allies would not be deterred from supporting Ukraine’s fight to defend its territory. “Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations charter, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force,” Biden said. “The Kremlin is organising a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the UN charter. This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. “Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime,” he said, adding that such “irresponsible nuclear threats” directly contradicted Russia’s international responsibilities and its agreement with a joint statement by nuclear weapons powers at the beginning of this year that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Seeking support from the developing world in what he framed as a contest between democracy and dictatorship, Biden offered US support for reform of the UN security council to make it more inclusive as well asbillion of dollars for global food security and efforts to curb disease. US officials have conceded that their focus on Ukraine has led some developing countries from the global south to feel that their concerns were being ignored in a great power showdown. In his speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to address those fears, pledging $2.9bn for food security this year, and $6bn for the global fund to fight Aids tuberculosis and malaria. He also threw US support behind a longstanding demand for a more inclusive and representative security council with more permanent and non-permanent members, including permanent seats for countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T16:53:35Z","webTitle":"The SNP was already clouded by failure – under Humza Yousaf it could lose power altogether | Dani Garavelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"So, in an SNP leadership contest that became a pitting of competence against progressive values, progressive values won out. Humza Yousaf – who has billed himself as the continuity candidate, the torchbearer for Nicola Sturgeon’s liberal agenda – came through in the end, although by a tighter margin than any new leader of a party would want. Those members for whom Kate Forbes’s views on sexual and LGBTQ+ equality were a red line – and who had pledged to tear up their membership cards if she was victorious – can breathe a sigh of relief. Ditto the wider central belt, left-of-the-party supporters, who had viewed the prospect of a fiscal and social lurch to the right with dismay. It’s true that with Yousaf there will be less immediate upheaval. As the “establishment” candidate, he already has the support of the majority of MSPs and ministers. He will find it easier than Forbes would have done to form a cabinet, and his election makes it unlikely the Greens will walk out of their powersharing deal, as they had already threatened to do if Forbes became first minister. But there are downsides to Yousaf’s victory, too, both for the party and the country. If there is one thing Forbes was right about, it is that “continuity won’t cut it”. Yousaf cannot just pick up where his predecessor left off. It was a growing recognition that the Salmond/Sturgeon era had run out of steam that led to her resignation. The divisions within the party, and the miasma of failure around it, have only increased as a result of a bitterly fought contest and a relentless succession of bad news stories, something that is evident in the tight result. Yousaf will take the helm with little of the goodwill that accompanied Sturgeon’s 2014 anointment. That she was able to unite such an ideologically disparate party was due in part to her popularity and control freak tendencies, and in part to a tacit agreement to “wheesht for indy” – that is, to suppress dissent in the service of the greater cause of independence. With no second referendum on the horizon, and Sturgeon out of the picture, the cork has popped off the bottle and will not be forced back in. Yousaf inherits a party where most of the big figures of the Sturgeon era – John Swinney, Jeane Freeman and chief executive, Peter Murrell – have departed, and one which faces a barrage of internal and external questions over its integrity and transparency. The clamour for answers has become louder in recent weeks, thanks to the Holyrood public audit committee’s damning report into the CalMac ferries scandal – which revealed the waste of taxpayers’ money running into the millions – and the revelation that the party had misled the media over a 30,000 drop in membership figures. And, of course, there is still the police probe into the £600,000 of funds said to have gone missing from the party’s accounts (the party has not responded to the allegation, due to the ongoing investigation). That Yousaf was at the heart of the SNP as its culture of complacency grew – that he either failed to notice or turned a blind eye to it – makes it harder for him to convincingly promise a reset. In addition, Yousaf’s competency for the top job is doubted even by some of those who voted for him. As justice secretary, he presided over the widely derided hate crime bill, and during his tenure as health secretary waiting times for hospital treatment soared. The crisis that has engulfed the NHS must be the new first minister’s top priority. But one might wonder how the man who was in charge of it as it declined is going to find new ideas and resources to fix it now. It is clear from his campaign that Yousaf understands the disappointment many supporters feel about the SNP’s failure to improve the lives of the marginalised. His openness to introducing new taxes for the wealthy is preferable to Forbes’s more conservative economic bent. And yet his pledge to hold a summit for anti-poverty groups has all the hallmarks of the same old, same old: setting up yet another talking shop instead of taking action. Meanwhile, his predisposition to fight the UK government on its section 35 obstruction of the SNP’s gender recognition reform bill may be exactly what the progressives who voted for him want; but it will also rekindle the divisions that helped force his predecessor’s exit. As for the opposition parties, they denigrated Sturgeon’s achievements during her final first minister’s questions last week. But they know the departure of such a formidable figure opens up fresh opportunities. One of the quirks of the contest was that many unionist activists and commentators seemed to be lobbying for Forbes, which suggests they thought a victory for her would most boost their own position. But the Greens would have been the likely beneficiaries of a mass exit of “woke” members, and Forbes might have proved a challenging adversary across the chamber. It is impossible yet to know if Scottish Labour will rise to the occasion and capitalise on the widening faultlines within the SNP. But it is worth noting that there are long-term supporters within the party who believe the best thing that could happen to it would be a term out of office; and that Yousaf as first minister might be the best way to achieve it.

This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Canary Wharf offices and retail spaces to be powered by Scottish windfarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","fields":{"bodyText":"Offices and retail spaces across the Canary Wharf business district will soon be powered by clean energy generated by a windfarm in Scotland. Canary Wharf Group, which manages the 60-hectare (150 acres) estate in east London, has struck a deal with one of the world’s biggest providers of renewable energy to meet almost three-quarters of its electricity demand from wind power. The deal is expected to help some of the UK’s biggest corporate names occupying office space in Canary Wharf – including EY, HSBC and BP – to cut their emissions while reducing their energy costs. Brookfield, an asset manager chaired by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, will provide Canary Wharf with green energy. The company, one of the world’s largest investors in renewable power, will do so by growing its renewables portfolio with the development of a new onshore windfarm in Scotland, which is due to begin generating electricity from 2026. The estate manager has bought renewable electricity for the business district from energy suppliers since 2012 but the deal with Brookfield is the first time it will source its clean electricity directly from a renewable energy project. The 15-year agreement could be extended to supply all of Canary Wharf’s 18m sq ft of office, retail and leisure spaces with 100% renewable electricity, according to Shobi Khan, the chief executive of Canary Wharf Group. Khan told the Guardian that the deal took three years to agree but should help to reduce electricity bills by about 50% compared with using power generated by gas power plants. The deal is part of a wider campaign to transform the estate into a sustainability leader, he said. “The point is to not only do something good for the environment but have it make good business sense, too,” Khan added. Brookfield has used its global portfolio of about 25,000 megawatts of renewable energy – the equivalent of all the UK’s onshore and offshore windfarms combined – to strike clean energy supply deals with about 700 corporate customers. The Canadian asset manager’s real estate investment arm also owns a 50% stake in Canary Wharf, which it acquired in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-11T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘Her writing became a catalyst for my own’: the power of Sylvia Plath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","fields":{"bodyText":"A few years ago a friend sent me a photo of himself wearing a Sylvia Plath T-shirt. It was pale pink – the colour of the Smith College memorandum paper on which the poet drafted many of her poems – and printed with the iconic picture of Plath in side profile, wearing a white hairband. I thought it was the greatest thing I’d ever seen. I am one of countless poets who developed an obsession with Sylvia Plath after being introduced to her work as a teenager, and her writing became a catalyst for my own. I recited her poems out loud in my bedroom, just as I would sing along to my favourite songs. The poems’ cadences sank into me, the way Plath sank into my own personal mythology, long before any other writers did. Beyond the power of her work, what Sylvia Plath represented to me is still hard to understand. On a personal level I felt a kinship with her because we had both lost parents as children (she, her father at eight; me, my mother at seven). We had both received sharp, early lessons in the savagery of the world. Such lessons are, of course, not unusual. Most teenagers, despite their backgrounds, have a sense of this savagery. Perhaps that’s why Plath’s work so often hits home in those years, when one is beginning to reckon with life’s difficulties and work out how, if, one might harness them. Ariel, Plath’s final, posthumously published collection of poems, shows us how. Understandably, these poems have often been interpreted in the light, or shadow, of her oncoming death. Sylvia Plath died of suicide 60 years ago today, at the age of 30. The circumstances around her death have been described, fictionalised, analysed – sometimes sensitively, more often voyeuristically – in biographies, memoirs, films and literature. Posterity loves a tragic female artist, a tendency that Plath’s daughter Frieda Hughes rightly objected to in My Mother, a furious poem written in response to the 2003 film about her parents, Ted and Sylvia. Its final lines read: They think I should love it – Having her back again, they think I should give them my mother’s words To fill the mouth of their monster, Their Sylvia Suicide Doll, Who will walk and talk And die at will, And die, and die And forever be dying. A death, however tragic, is only a very small part of a life. There is in fact incredible vigour and energy in Plath’s poems. Despite the anguish that powered its writing, Ariel is full of bright, glittering images, “electrifyingly-colored sherbets”, flowers of astonishing redness, and its soundtrack is hoofbeats. I read these things as symbols of the poet’s irrepressible life force, not her illness. Plath’s most recent biographer, Heather Clark, sought to make the poet’s life, not her death, the driving force of her book. Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath, a title taken from Plath’s poem Stings, captures perfectly the reasons why we should remember her. “Comet” comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “long-haired star”, an image that calls to mind the ending of Plath’s Lady Lazarus, a poem about coming back from the dead: “Out of the ash / I rise with my red hair’. Stings uses the metaphor of a beehive and its queen bee to describe a kind of renaissance of the self. The poet writes: “They thought death was worth it, but I / Have a self to recover, a queen.” As we memorialise Sylvia Plath on the anniversary of her death, we should honour this spirit of resurrection – and recover a queen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
