The elegant century-old property on one of Miami’s most exclusive islands was quietly razed earlier this month. The take-down followed the enactment of a law from the DeSantis administration last summer stripping municipalities of their power to prevent the demolition of certain properties, regardless of historic designation. The owners of the 1922 Mediterranean-style villa and guest house, which had nine bedrooms and once boasted the city’s largest private swimming pool, moved quickly to obtain a demolition permit, ending a years-long campaign to save the residence at which Capone is said to have plotted the St Valentine’s Day massacre. Observers say the law poses an unprecedented threat to Miami’s historic neighborhoods and skyline, with wealthy landowners and developers “salivating” at the opportunity to wipe away unprotected older buildings of character and architectural significance for soulless modern “McMansions”. “The new owner has come along, paid 15m plus, and decided not to dramatize this thing, just knock it down and present everyone a fait accompli,” said Paul George, the resident historian of the HistoryMiami museum. “That’s essentially what happened here, it lost whatever protection it had. The ghost of Al Capone was vivid in Greater Miami all this time and with the demolition we lose a sense of place, we lose a picture and an idea of what things were like in a certain time, and we lose that idea of who lived there and how they lived. “Now you’ve got a vacant lot, and it’s a lot harder to draw a mind picture of what went on there over the previous 100 years than it would be if the building was still standing.” The property had a checkered recent past. It went through several owners and fell into disrepair by the early years of this century before its restoration to prohibition-era opulence in 2015. Original features such as a striking all-black art deco bathroom were refurbished, along with additions made by Capone after he bought the house for $40,000 in 1928. Those additions included a two-story pool cabana and a gated sentry house from which armed guards would watch the road outside. It last changed hands in 2021, bought for $15.5m by the Miami businessman Albert Claramonte and his wife Karise, who already owned the adjoining property on Palm Island. The couple’s reported original plan to level the Capone buildings and merge the two lots was stalled until the new law took effect. Karise Claramonte hung up on a call from the Guardian. Toni Alum, a spokesperson for the family’s trust, told the Miami Herald in November that disclosing their vision for the 30,000 sq ft (0.7-acre) lot would “ruin the plans we are working on”. Deirdre Marie Capone, the mobster’s great-niece and only living family member with memories of the “majestic” mansion, said she was saddened by its demise. She recalled her great-uncle living his final years there in seclusion and ill health between his 1939 release from Alcatraz after serving seven and a half years for tax evasion, and his death from a heart attack following a syphilis-induced stroke in January 1947. “The whole family would come from Chicago and gather around my uncle every Christmas. I kind of grew up there, I learned to swim there, and I learned to ride a bike there,” the 83-year-old said. “I have a lot of early memories of playing there and being in the pool with my dad and my uncle, it was an unbelievable piece of property. It was a symbol of what Miami Beach was back in the beginning, and when you were in the house you’d feel old Florida. “I was happy when I saw the people of Miami Beach rallying and petitioning not to have it torn down, but money comes in and people want more. It’s sad because it’s going on so much around here, getting rid of the past for something bigger and more luxurious.” DeSantis signed the law, formally the resiliency and safe structure act, in May of last year. With few exceptions, it removes the ability of municipalities anywhere in Florida to block the demolition of any coastal or flood zone structure deemed a hazard, or not up to code, even if it is recognized locally as historic. Its sponsor, the Republican state senator Bryan Avila, insisted the law was needed to hasten the removal of dangerous or worn-out buildings at risk of collapse, and was not intended to smooth a path for greedy developers. “Ocean Drive is not going to get bulldozed,” he told legislative colleagues in April. Critics, however, say the law opens up exactly that possibility and is another example of a DeSantis power grab. The governor has previously asserted control in areas under the purview of other entities, including higher education, the drawing up of voting maps, mandating that municipalities keep burning fossil fuels; plus oversight of Disney, Florida’s largest private employer. In its analysis of the law, Florida Politics notes that numerous iconic buildings and neighborhoods in and around Miami are now without protection, including the Art Deco design district, the Versace mansion on South Beach and the Delano hotel. “It’s government overreach, and it’s going to have a detrimental effect on the character of our city that we’re already seeing with the Capone house,” said Sarah Giller Nelson, chair of the Miami Beach design review board. “People from all over the world come to Miami Beach to take in our historic buildings. Those who live in Miami Beach love it. Our unique, historic character is a huge economic driver and this law undermines that, so it makes no sense.” Nelson continued: “Boards like the one I chair ensure the quality of design compatibility within the community, and the law completely does away with our authority and input. It’s deflating.” George, the veteran historian, agreed. “We have all these great buildings and great neighborhoods in jeopardy,” he said. “The developers are salivating.” This article was amended on 27 August 2023 to correct the date on which DeSantis signed the demolition law."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T15:58:58Z","webTitle":"Cynical Tories can’t understand the power of compassion and community | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","fields":{"bodyText":"During the Covid pandemic, I worked as a Catholic chaplain in an NHS hospital. In those very worst of times, I witnessed the very best of humanity. I am amazed, therefore, that in her war against the “anti-growth coalition”, Liz Truss attempts to squander one of the few positive elements to emerge from the pandemic: cooperation and mutual support within communities. She talks in aggressive and combative terms about those who don’t agree with her ideas for growth, hoping for another Brexit-like split in society. During the pandemic, our hospital and community, like many throughout the world, worked together to support and care for one another. All ideological and political arguments were set aside as we realised that we had to work together. The strong ties that we built during the pandemic are being threatened by the rhetoric of the prime minister and her cabinet. She is behaving like the worst of tyrants, encouraging communities to look for the enemy within. This is disgraceful behaviour. It is so sad that she seeks to highlight the divisions in society, rather than calling for us all to work together, to make our communities safe, prosperous and happy once again. Josephine Feeney Leicester • The opinion pieces in last Saturday’s paper revealed just how ideological and fantastical Tory policy really is. I would like to suggest that Conservative ministers come and spend some time in towns and cities like mine, not just on a flying “here today, gone tomorrow” visit, but as members of the community. Were they to come to Newport, I would like to introduce them to the teachers who give substantially to their in-house food schemes out of a sense of vocational responsibility; the churches and other civic groups that run school uniform banks, breakfast clubs and night shelters; the Mind charity groups that try to provide struggling people with a little peace and quiet for a few hours a week; the outreach schemes that feed the homeless on the streets, and so many more. I would like to show members of the government what dignity, compassion and community look like in practice. I would like to introduce them to the poor helping the poor, and I would like to remind them that the rights and freedoms that some of them now enjoy were won in cities like mine. But above all, I would like to show them how compassion trumps ideology every time. Canon Andrew Lightbown Newport Cathedral • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After a £9bn investment by Malaysia-backed developers and more than a decade of restoration, the doors to the almost century-old decommissioned power station opened on Friday for the first time in 40 years. The space has been transformed into a glitzy shopping centre of 250 stores, alongside mostly luxury flats, office spaces and an upcoming cinema and ice rink. After the grand opening, a five-day free festival of live music will take place on the site. Emma and Marcus Liberman, a married couple from north-west London, decided to travel down for the centre’s opening after decades of speculation regarding what would become of the former industrial station. “When we first came to London, there were plans for redeveloping the power station about 30 years ago, but it never came to anything,” Marcus said. “And I’ve always looked to this amazing building, and wanted to see what it was really about, so just really wanted to come and see it.” He added: “It’s just really exciting to see it actually turned it something, being used and full of life again, as opposed to a rather sad looking, deteriorating building.” Bernice Ondebola, a 67-year-old retired nurse who has lived in Battersea for most of her life, said the new development was a “lovely sight” compared with the abandoned and derelict former station. “I grew up in south London, and have been living not too far away from the power station for the past 35 years,” Ondebola said. “In some ways the area is so unrecognisable compared to when I first started living here, with, you know, all the new flats and also the new tube. But I think the shopping centre is nice because it has a bit of everything for everyone.” Ondebola said she especially liked how the centre, despite its modernisation, has retained many of its period features. “You can really feel that you’re inside the power station, with all the exposed brick and the machinery you can see on the ceiling,” she ssaid. “The building has such a big presence in our local area so it’s nice that it has become a place that everybody can use.” Serge, a 52-year-old business owner and who has lived in London for the past 30 years, said that watching the power station transform from an abandoned building had been momentous. “I’ve seen the station abandoned, and the whole surroundings at that time wasn’t very pleasant-looking. It’s very nice to see somebody invested in the area and moved the whole project ahead”, he said. Although most people attending the opening were positive about the redevelopment, there was some concerns raised about the lack of affordable housing provided – at just 386 homes, a 40% reduction from the original plans. Alice White, a 25-year-old student, was at first sceptical when she heard of the power station’s redevelopment plans. “I know there was a lot of debate about how many of the new flats inside the station would actually be affordable,” White said. But despite still having some reservations regarding the development, White thought the centre was “quite enticing”. “I can’t lie, the range of shops and places to eat here are kind of exciting,” White adds. “I live locally, and what I’m most happy about is not having to go all the way to Westfield or Oxford Street whenever I need to make some returns at Zara.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T17:28:49Z","webTitle":"Putin and Macron trade blame over risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron have traded blame over safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which has been a focal point of fighting in recent weeks. Separate readouts of a phone call between the French and Russian presidents highlighted the difficulties in trying to find an accord to ensure safety at the site. “The Russian side drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on the plant’s facilities, including radioactive waste storage, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences,” said a statement published on the Kremlin’s website. It called for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In its statement, the French presidency said the occupation by Russian troops of the plant was what was putting it at risk. “He [Macron] asked that Russian forces withdraw their heavy and light weapons and that the IAEA’s recommendations be followed to ensure safety at the site,” the Elysee said. Earlier, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said the last operating reactor at the plant had been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Energoatom, the state-run operator of all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, said one of the power lines was restored on Saturday night, allowing plant operators to shut down the last reactor. “A decision was made to shut down power unit No 6 and transfer it to the safest state: cold shutdown,” the operator said. Electricity supply to the plant has been cut with increasing frequency over the past few weeks, including at least three times last week. Energoatom said the risk of continued damage to the supply line “remains high” and that it did not want to risk the plant being powered by diesel generators, “the duration of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel”. The plant was disconnected from the Ukrainian grid for the first time in its history on 25 August. Energoatom has called for a demilitarisation of the plant by Russian forces, who took control of the area in early March. On Friday the IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said the situation at the plant was increasingly precarious, after its offsite electricity supply line was cut again. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over shelling of the plant and the nearby area. Ukraine claims Russia is carrying out attacks as part of a false-flag operation to blame Ukraine. Russia blames Ukraine’s forces. Researchers and journalists have pointed to some evidence that supports part of Ukraine’s claims. However, the Guardian has not been able to independently verify events at the power plant. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA’s director general, warned last week that Ukraine was considering shutting down the plant because it “no longer had confidence in the offsite power”. Grossi did not apportion blame for the shelling of the plant. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply, the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said.

Marcus Rashford’s five goals in nine games is United’s highest tally, with Antony, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho each scoring three times and Cristiano Ronaldo twice. United’s only other scorer is Bruno Fernandes, who has one strike in 12 appearances. Ten Hag, asked whether he has players who can score at least 20, said: “Yes, I’m confident, mostly. In my team, there are players who will score. They come into the [scoring] position and in the last part [of the field]. It’s also about the freedom from the player, the intuition, the space they have to take. When they have that feeling then you will see that with their talent they will score that number. “You can also divide it, because we have many goalscorers across the offensive department. But we also need something from midfield and the defensive department.” Rashford’s buildup play sparkled in Thursday’s 1-0 Europa League victory against Omonia Nicosia though his finishing disappointed. “He did a lot of things well but finally he knows that he has to be more clinical and he has to score a goal,” Ten Hag said. “When you have such good movements and make such good combinations, good actions, then you have to finish. I know sometimes it’s the game, it’s not your night and it’s about the form of the day but it can change in another game. “He’s in a really good run, that shows in the chances he creates. Now it’s in the last two games he’s been a little unlucky. On Sunday [at Everton] he deserved a goal but they cancelled it [for a handball]; today he didn’t score. I say save it for the coming week.” United host Newcastle on Sunday, then Tottenham on Wednesday before Saturday’s visit to Chelsea. “These are real tests for us as a squad to go into battle,” Ten Hag said. “And it delivers energy. Newcastle do really well. It’s a team who can play in high intensity with a lot of energy and that makes it a tough opponent. We know we have to play our best.” In midfield Ten Hag can choose from Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Fred. He is yet to settle on his best combination. “It’s difficult to say in this moment,” he said. “They have to play longer together but what’s important is that we need a squad. Fred played a good game [against Omonia]. We have some combinations and in the midfield it’s always about balance. I’m happy with all four and hope they keep going this way.” Martial faces a fitness test but Harry Maguire’s hamstring requires more time to heal. “Next week he’ll be back in training or after next week,” said Ten Hag."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T09:52:27Z","webTitle":"Cubans protest over power outages four days after Hurricane Ian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/cubans-protest-over-power-outages-four-days-after-hurricane-ian","fields":{"bodyText":"Four days after Ian, a category three hurricane, protests have sprung up at different points in Cuba over the lack of electricity after the storm. Alex Bandrich, 35, a graphic designer with his chihuahua, Richi, in hand, was at a protest with more than 100 people on a main road of the well-heeled Vedado neighbourhood on Saturday night. “I haven’t had light in my house for the last five days,” he said. “I’ve lost food, although I kept some at a friend’s place [with power], and I’ve had to take my daughter to my mother-in-law’s place.” Given the stress that people without power are under, the atmosphere at the Vedado protest was calm. Police didn’t interfere with the protest, there were no arrests. Instead, the state opted to send officials, accompanied by party members, to talk with protesters. María Perez, who identified as a regular citizen, said she had come to talk to protesters to defend “the revolution”. “Every time I think the social project that we have created is in danger, I will be here,” she said. Still protesters’ tactics were creative, creating a quandary for the state: there were reports that people lined up in the street to block traffic outside the capital’s main baseball stadium; in east Havana, others put rocks outside a bus station, saying they wouldn’t allow transport to run until the power came back. State authorities say that power – which went out across Cuba after Hurricane Ian – was mostly back in the capital as of Friday afternoon. Since the hurricane, protests have also been reported in the western city of Matanzas and the eastern city of Holguin. On Thursday and Friday night there was no internet in Cuba. It was not clear whether this was coordinated by the government in order to make protests more difficult to organise (as has happened before) or whether the internet blackout was a result of power failure caused by the storm. The internet was mostly functioning Saturday night. The Cuban government regularly tries to distinguish between “legitimate” protests by upstanding citizens, and “counter-revolutionary” protests, typically backed by the US, which imposes sanctions on the country. While the former is enshrined in the country’s 2019 constitution, the government says it will not tolerate the latter. The distinction, however, often breaks down in practice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T08:05:20Z","webTitle":"Penny Wong and Paul Keating spar as minister warns against ‘frenzied’ Taiwan war speculation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/17/penny-wong-and-paul-keating-spar-as-minister-warns-against-frenzied-taiwan-war-speculation","fields":{"bodyText":"Penny Wong has warned politicians and media against playing “the most dangerous of parlour games” by adding to “frenzied” speculation about a war over Taiwan. The Australian foreign affairs minister said on Monday that such a conflict would be “catastrophic for all” and there would be “no real winners” – but the warning was quickly overshadowed by a fresh war of words with Paul Keating. Wong hit back at the former Labor prime minister, who ridiculed the minister for “running around the Pacific islands with a lei around [her] neck handing out money”. “I think in tone and substance he diminished both his legacy and the subject matter,” Wong told the National Press Club in Canberra, adding that Australia had a clear interest in a peaceful, stable region. Keating gave his latest retort two hours later, saying Wong had spoken in platitudes about keeping the balance of power but had “not a jot of an idea as to how this might be achieved”. In a statement on Monday, Keating said Australia was “straddling a strategic divide, a divide rapidly becoming every bit as rigid” as seen in Europe in 1914 at the outbreak of the first world war. “Australia’s major foreign policy task is to soften that rigidity by encouraging both the United States and China to find common cause and benefit in a peaceful and prosperous Pacific. Nothing Penny Wong said today, on Australia’s behalf, adds one iota of substance to that urgent task.” Wong’s speech focused on the need for all countries to “exercise our agency to avert war and maintain peace” at a time when the Indo-Pacific region faced “the most confronting circumstances in decades”. Wong said Australia did not want great power competition between the US and China to “career into conflict”. In the wake of Nine newspapers’ controversial “Red Alert” series – which warned of the risk of war within three years – Wong said there was “much frenzied discussion in political and media circles over timelines and scenarios when it comes to Taiwan”. “Anyone in positions like mine who feels an urge to add to that discussion should resist the temptation,” she said. “It is the most dangerous of parlour games.” Wong said Australia stood against any unilateral change to the status quo over Taiwan, and opposed the threat or use of force or coercion, because this was “the proposition most capable of averting conflict and enabling the region to live in peace and prosperity”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the speech, without naming Keating, Wong took aim at “some” who implied that “we should attach ourselves to what they anticipate will be a hegemonic China”. She named Robert Menzies and John Howard as examples of “those throughout Australia’s history who have thought our foreign policy should simply be to attach ourselves to a great power”. But she said the Albanese government would “always be more ambitious for Australia” and pursue greater self-reliance. China has not ruled out the use of force to take Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that Beijing claims as a wayward province. Earlier this month China engaged in three days of military drills near Taiwan in what it called a “stern warning” after Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, travelled to the US and met the house speaker, Kevin McCarthy. Wong said the job of the Australian government was to “lower the heat on any potential conflict, while increasing pressure on others to do the same”. “That may not sell as many newspapers today, but it will help you to sell them for a lot longer,” she said. She said Australia shared “the objective of a world that is free of nuclear weapons” but refused to give a timeframe on Labor meeting its platform commitment to sign and ratify a landmark new UN treaty. Wong acknowledged one of the reasons more than 90 counties had now signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was because of “frustration that there has been insufficient progress” towards disarmament. “If this can spur more progress in that arena, that is a good thing,” she said. “We set out very transparently in the party platform our consideration of that treaty.” The platform commitment was subject to a number of conditions, including the need to work to achieve universal support for the TPNW, but at present the nuclear weapons states, including the US, oppose the blanket ban. Wong confirmed, though, that the US had given an assurance that the American submarines to visit Australia on increased rotations from 2027 would be conventionally armed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/russian-nuclear-sabre-rattling-is-designed-to-create-fear-in-the-west","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T17:26:46Z","webTitle":"Russian nuclear sabre-rattling is designed to create fear in the west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/russian-nuclear-sabre-rattling-is-designed-to-create-fear-in-the-west","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/russian-nuclear-sabre-rattling-is-designed-to-create-fear-in-the-west","fields":{"bodyText":"It was inevitable, after Russia’s sudden military reverse near Kharkiv, that Vladimir Putin would respond, announcing a partial mobilisation of extra troops and a fresh bout of sabre-rattling on nuclear weapons a day after announcing plans to hold high-speed annexation referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine. The timing, on the morning of Joe Biden’s speech to the UN general assembly aimed at rallying support for Ukraine, demonstrates that, to some extent, Putin’s announcements are about news management – to seize the agenda with tenuous claims that Russia is threatened by Nato “nuclear blackmail”. That helps cover up the fact that the mobilisation – of about 300,000 Russians with military experience, according to Sergei Shoigu, the country’s defence minister – is a measure that will take months to have any meaningful military impact. If, that is, Moscow can obtain anything like that number at all, given Russia’s ongoing difficulties in recruitment and retention. Resignation letters written by Russian troops exhausted by months of fighting following the recapture of Izium illustrate the point, although the decree announced by Putin also makes clear soldiers on short contracts are now barred from leaving the frontline until the war is over. “Operationally, this won’t make any difference this year and probably not into next year,” said Ed Arnold, who works for RUSI, a thinktank. “The infrastructure isn’t there in terms of equipping that level of force at the moment. Russia has a 1000km frontline to hold, and it is worried about its rear areas. It wants to hold the area it has.” In military terms, the Kremlin should have taken the mobilisation decision months ago. Exact figures are hard to come by, but Ukraine may well have more troops available than Russia now. And as the Kharkiv region offensive showed, Kyiv can marshal fresher troops against areas of the front it has been able to identify as thinly held. Kyiv continues to have a window of opportunity before the late autumn muddy season, starting in November, which limits manoeuvre for armoured vehicles. That is long before any reservists are likely to arrive. Recognising that, last Friday the US announced a further $600m of military aid to Ukraine, including more Himars rockets that have so damaged Moscow’s logistics and its ability to resist. It is a flow of aid that Russia is desperate to halt, but has no military ability to do so. Targeting Nato distribution hubs in Poland is not a viable option, given Nato’s security guarantee. Moscow clearly lacks the intelligence to destroy supplies in meaningful quantities as they head to the frontline, or it would have done so in the way that Ukraine has been able to. But Putin, by reinforcing warnings that nuclear weapons will be used “if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened”, will hope to sow uncertainty in the eyes of policymakers’ meetings in New York – perhaps to limit supplies from countries reluctant to allow Ukraine to have certain weapons, such as ATACMS long-range missiles, fighter jets or western tanks because of their offensive capability. The Kremlin also needs to retain what support it has left from its flagging allies – even Putin acknowledged China’s president, Xi Jinping, had “questions and concerns” following a bilateral last week – and argues that Nato is effectively engaged in a war against it. Shoigu emphasised, in an interview on Wednesday, the west’s supply of satellite intelligence and weapons against Moscow’s forces. It is no secret that Nato members (but not Nato itself) are providing military support to Ukraine but there is no existential threat to Russia; the goal, Biden said on Wednesday, was for the war to end “on terms we all signed up for, that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by choice”. There is the question of whether Russia will try to argue territories it annexes are covered by its nuclear umbrella – but attacks on Crimea, seized unilaterally in 2014, have not prompted any escalation from Moscow. The precursor of Putin’s interventions remains Russia’s unexpected defeat on the battlefield earlier this month. The nuclear sabre-rattling is designed principally to produce uncertainty and fear in the west, while the belated mobilisation can only help improve Moscow’s prospects from next spring, when the war is most likely to enter a decisive phase. But it also gives time for Ukraine to prepare too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-16T11:00:18Z","webTitle":"The Ghost Variations by Damian Lanigan review – the power of the piano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/16/the-ghost-variations-by-damian-lanigan-review-the-power-of-the-piano","fields":{"bodyText":"Early in The Ghost Variations, the third novel by Damian Lanigan, the narrator approaches a woman in a bar to ask her a question: “Would you mind if I played the piano a little? I’ll be quiet. And I’ll be good. I’ll be quietly good.” Quietly good: the phrase aptly describes this accomplished book about love, grief and the constraining and consoling effects of art. Declan Byrnie grew up in a family with Irish roots in working-class Manchester, but his prodigious gifts as a classical pianist transported him to a lavish world of concert halls and oligarchs’ homes. He was at the height of his fame when his wife, Esther, died in mysterious circumstances during a hiking trip; bereft, he disappeared from the music scene for four years. We meet Byrnie as he prepares for what, having been coaxed by his agent to perform again before adoring audiences and a prurient media, he sardonically calls the “Dead Wife Tour”. Byrnie’s sense of loss suffuses his whole worldview. Now a New Yorker, he spends his evenings rotating between “four or five bars in Upper Manhattan with instruments I can use, a rust belt of these old machines, remnants of a world becoming derelict”. He tells an interviewer: “I think it’s obvious we’re close to losing all this stuff” – that is, the historical repertoire of piano music – “which would be a tragedy … We wouldn’t stand by if St Paul’s Cathedral were being dismantled before our eyes. If the Uffizi were on fire, someone would try to put it out.” Initially, Byrnie attempts to douse the flames of his own loss through the simulacrum of intimacy offered by casual sex: “Women are curious about gifted men, and upon this fact I continue to rely.” Byrnie is no predator, and Lanigan undoubtedly intends us to view his protagonist’s erotic exploits through a tragic lens. But the descriptions of Byrnie’s sexual conquests occasionally cause the story to veer close to the derelict world of late 20th-century novels about male geniuses surrounded by nubile and sexually voracious young women. A long section describing Byrnie’s road trip with Elise, a woman 10 years his junior, would have benefited from less flesh – Elise spends most of her time in a bikini – and more fleshing out of character. A myopic protagonist can be an asset to a novel: take The Unconsoled, Kazuo Ishiguro’s great work about a dementia-afflicted concert pianist, a clear influence here. In that book the reader is constantly aware of the distance between the narrator’s perceptions and the reality beyond them. But I was struck by the occasional bum notes in Lanigan’s prose as he describes the endlessly available women around Byrnie – “her wet blue eyes, her mouth, pouty and mobile … I occasionally ascend into thoughts of its hot slitheriness”. By contrast, The Ghost Variations is usually pitch-perfect when it describes Byrnie’s enduring passion and the novel’s core theme: music. Lanigan writes eloquently about both the exhilaration and mundanity of a musician’s life, the euphoria of the audience’s applause and the “tedious, arduous, repetitive, ugly work” of practising. And he is convincing in his portrait of a man for whom the piano is both an obstacle to human contact (“the composers … never disappoint like real people”) and ultimately his means of redemption. But it’s in the difficult work of translating the medium of music to that of prose that Lanigan most excels. A Chopin Berceuse sounds like “starlit water games”. Byrnie plans to play Beethoven’s Hammerklavier Sonata with “an almost meditative expression, as if the music was resolved before it began, its end present in its beginning, so any sense of narrative or struggle would be needless”. Bach offers “a view of the cosmos as explicable and morally correct, constellations turning in rhythm over the imperfect world, a presiding power observing and forgiving”. As I read, I found myself reaching for my headphones to experience the pieces this novel describes so beautifully, the music enhanced by Lanigan’s words and vice versa.

The Ukrainian president arrived in Hiroshima on a French government plane on Saturday to discuss greater military support from the US and other G7 countries as his forces prepare for a huge counteroffensive in the war with Russia. Sunak noted that the G7 had once been the G8, before Russia was expelled in 2014 for its illegal annexation of Crimea and “flagrant abuse of human rights and the rule of law”. He added: “Nine years on, it sends an incredibly powerful message to have my friend and Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy with us in Hiroshima today. It tells the world that the G7 stands united with the people of Ukraine, in the face of a terrible onslaught. And it demonstrates that brute force and oppression will not triumph over freedom and sovereignty. “I am delighted that the G7 has agreed on the importance of giving President Zelenskiy the advanced military equipment needed to win this war and prosper as a free and democratic nation.” UK sources said it was Sunak’s suggestion Zelenskiy should come to the G7 to make his case in person, adding that he had made this proposal in a phone call about a month ago. Sunak’s official spokesperson said: “It is an opportunity for President Zelenskiy to address a lot of world leaders in one place at a time when western leaders are aligned.” In his first face-to-face meeting with Narendra Modi, who has called for a ceasefire but not condemned Russia, Zelenskiy briefed the Indian prime minister on Ukraine’s peace plan, which calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the country before negotiations can start. Zelenskiy later said he had asked Modi to help implement the peace plan. “I spoke about Ukraine’s needs in humanitarian demining and mobile hospitals,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “I thank India for supporting our country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, in particular, at the platforms of international organisations, and for providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine.” In their final communique – released a day earlier than expected – the G7 leaders reaffirmed their support for Ukraine. “Russia’s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community,” it said. “We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.” Zelenskiy’s arrival in Hiroshima comes a day after the White House announced it would permit allied countries to supply Ukraine with US-built F-16 fighter jets. Before leaving for Japan, Zelenskiy described the decision ashistoric, adding that he looked forward to “discussing the practical implementation” with G7 countries. The White House said Joe Biden was looking forward to meeting Zelenskiy at the summit, with the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, saying it was a “safe bet” that the pair would meet. “The president looks forward to the opportunity to be able to sit down face to face,” he said. With the US veto on F-16s lifted, Sunak announced that Britain would work together with the US and the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark to get Ukraine the combat air capability it needs. Japan is the farthest Zelenskiy has travelled to make the case for more military aid, and comes after visits to Italy, Germany, France and Britain. He was in Saudi Arabia to attend the Arab League summit before heading to Hiroshima, where he is expected to take part in two separate sessions on Sunday – one with G7 members and another focusing on “peace and stability” with non-G7 countries taking part in the Hiroshima summit. That will give him a rare opportunity to speak to the leaders of powerful non-aligned countries, including Brazil, who have declined to condemn Russia’s invasion. Amid concerns over Russia’s refusal to rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Zelenskiy is expected to visit a museum devoted to the horrors of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945 and a memorial to the hundreds of thousands of people who died as a result of the attack. In their communique, the G7 leaders said they were committed “to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, through taking a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. We reaffirm the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to create a more stable and safer world.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons condemned the statement as a rehash of proposals that had “failed to deliver progress over the past three decades”. “They did not announce any new, concrete measures,” it said in a statement, adding: “What is needed from the G7 is responsible leadership to respond to the acute danger that nuclear weapons could be used in conflict for the first time since 1945, but rather than this, we heard criticism of Russia, North Korea and China which, while justified, evaded the G7’s own responsibility for the current threat nuclear weapons pose to everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T18:19:10Z","webTitle":"Is Vladimir Putin happy to risk nuclear war to avoid admitting defeat? | Andrew Roth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/20/vladimir-putin-escalation-ukraine-nuclear-war-annexation","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has backed himself into a corner in Ukraine. And true to form, the Russian leader is ready to escalate, perhaps up to the brink of nuclear war, rather than admit defeat. Seven months after Putin launched his invasion, Russian troops have been driven back in the Kharkiv region, and Ukrainian forces are advancing in Luhansk and squeezing his troops and supply lines in Kherson. It is not impossible that Russia could lose territories that it has held since 2014 if Putin’s forces cannot stop Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Facing humiliation, Putin has issued a new threat: holding “referenda” in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, which could lead to them being annexed by Russia by early next week. In the mind of Russia’s formalistic leader, that would turn the “special military operation” in Ukraine into a defensive war in Russia, opening up the possibility of a full mobilisation, declaration of war and even a nuclear strike. Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of the state-owned broadcaster RT and a vocal lobbyist for the war, said: “Judging by what is happening and what is about to happen, this week marks either the threshold of our imminent victory or the threshold of a nuclear war. I can’t see any third option.” There is little doubt that Russia’s plan – holding sham referenda to annex Ukrainian territories and threaten a massive military escalation – is just blackmail. Ukrainians were quick to recognise it as an attempt to halt the counteroffensive. “Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will keep liberating them whatever Russia has to say,” said Dmytro Kuleba, the Ukrainian foreign minister. But since February, it has become clear that few actually understand the depths of the Kremlin’s mania over Ukraine or Putin’s willingness to waste the lives and welfare of Russians, as well as his own legacy, in order to exert his will over his neighbour. The Kremlin’s strategy is fraught with risk. New annexations could further undermine Russian control over territories such as Crimea, by convincing Ukraine and the west that Moscow is delivering empty threats and reducing hesitation at retaking territory formally annexed by Russia. So is the latest threat an ultimatum meant to save Russia from defeat? Or is Russia ready to go all the way? Both are perhaps true. If Ukraine and western supporters blink (which is unlikely), Putin will be happy, analysts say. If not, well, whatever comes next is not our fault, the Kremlin thinks. Alexander Baunov, a Russian political analyst, wrote: “Moscow’s actions, therefore, are being taken to either end the war as soon as possible or, if that doesn’t work, to put the blame for that on other people and turn Russia’s invasion of a neighbouring country into a defensive war. “Moscow hopes that that distinction will make the conflict more legitimate in the eyes of ordinary Russians, leaving the Kremlin free to make whatever decisions and take whatever measures it deems necessary.” Putin has sometimes been called an expert in the strategy of “escalating to de-escalate” – averting conflict by threatening a massive retaliation. But Putin does not seem to want to de-escalate. A more apt description of his strategy may be “win or escalate”. And as Simonyan puts it: Russia is going all in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/07/an-understated-power-hamish-kilgour-of-the-clean-remembered-as-a-restless-innovator","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T02:01:03Z","webTitle":"‘An understated power’: Hamish Kilgour of the Clean remembered as a restless innovator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/an-understated-power-hamish-kilgour-of-the-clean-remembered-as-a-restless-innovator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/07/an-understated-power-hamish-kilgour-of-the-clean-remembered-as-a-restless-innovator","fields":{"bodyText":"In July 1981 the drummer Hamish Kilgour, who has died at age 65, went with his band the Clean to record their first single in Christchurch, New Zealand. Roger Shepherd, a local record shop manager, had given the band $50 to make a record that would kickstart his new label called Flying Nun. Over only a few hours in a makeshift studio in the back of a house, the Clean recorded Tally Ho!, a song that the journalist Russell Brown said “starts stopped hearts”, and which rocketed up New Zealand’s singles chart. It was a single that turned the country’s music industry on its head. A band from South Island had made a song for next to nothing, released it on a local independent label and everyone loved it. Overnight Flying Nun was transformed into a legitimate label and the Clean became sensations with a sound that would reach around the world. Hamish Kilgour had started the Clean two years earlier with his brother David on guitar and vocals. The brothers had grown up in the small rural communities of Cheviot and Ranfurly before they moved to Dunedin in the early 1970s. Inspired by a local proto-punk outfit, the Enemy, led by Chris Knox, and 60s acts including the Velvet Underground, the Kilgours formed the Clean. The Velvet’s Mo Tucker had a particular impact on Hamish Kilgour; he taught himself to play the drums miming along to the Velvet’s What Goes On from their 1969 live album. Early on it was tough going for the Clean, and local pubs showed little interest in them. But when the bassist Robert Scott joined the group in 1980, everything clicked. They quickly became one of the best live bands in the country. Garage fanzine’s editor, Richard Langston, described it as a sound that just “swamped over you … with that pulsing dirty metallic pop”. And though records like Tally Ho! and the follow-up Boodle Boodle Boodle EP were big sellers that helped finance label Flying Nun’s catalogue for several years, they also reconfigured common perceptions of how a record could be made. With the help of Chris Knox and Doug Hood, the Boodle EP was made in an old Auckland hall with just a four-track, yet songs like the Hamish-sung Point That Thing Somewhere Else sounded stunning despite being relatively lo-fi. From the outset, Kilgour was strikingly independent and constantly looking for new inspirations to fuel his music and to challenge expectations. “The music business is a business and it’s dollars and cents, charts, units and product, which is totally divorced from what I believe in,” he told Rip It Up in 1982. “Music inspires you. It makes life more enjoyable … You have to keep experimenting and remain open to things.” These sentiments carried through to every band he played in. In mid 1982, while the Clean had two EPs riding high in the charts and they were playing to packed audiences, they suddenly announced they were breaking up. There was no infighting or drama, everyone in the band simply felt burnt out and uninspired. After the Clean split, Kilgour started another band with David – the Great Unwashed, a name that seemed to refute everything that came before it. Hamish’s idea for their first tour was to load up a van and visit holiday towns. He was committed to reaching the unreached. But when one of their tracks was played by John Peel and UK tastemakers took an interest in Flying Nun bands, Kilgour was hesitant to seize on the hype. “I wouldn’t think of going over there in terms of chasing success,” he said. Instead, the Great Unwashed fell apart and Kilgour went on to start another seminal band, Bailter Space, with Alister Parker of the Gordons. Kilgore dusted off an old Clean favourite, I’m in Love With These Times, for their great first EP, but again it wasn’t long before he felt the urge for something different. When Bailter Space headed over to New York to play a prominent industry showcase, Kilgour opted not to travel back to New Zealand following the gigs. New York became his home for more than 20 years. He arrived in the US just as it was becoming apparent how much the Clean had rubbed off on many of the bigger bands in the underground scenes. Groups such as Pavement and Yo La Tengo showed a clear debt to the Dunedin trio, and the former even covered the band’s song Oddity. It was a perfect time for the Clean to get back together, starting with some reunion shows in 1988. But rather than tour and thrash out old favourites, Kilgour and his bandmates remained steadfast about making new music that challenged both themselves and their fans. This started with their first full-length album, 1990’s Vehicle, which featured some of his best vocal work for the Clean. Several other standout albums followed, many of them featuring artwork by Kilgour, including the covers of Modern Rock and Getaway. With members split between New Zealand and New York, the Clean were never a constant, and it gave Kilgour time to pursue other projects. He released several records with his band the Mad Scene alongside his then partner Lisa Siegel, and also issued two inspired solo records All of It and Nothing and Finklestein. While back in New Zealand he got together with old friends Paul Kean and Kaye Woodward of the Bats, and Alec Bathgate of Tall Dwarfs to form the Sundae Painters, who released a single in 2021 and had more records in the works. With Hamish, the music never stopped. He was enlivened with the idea of constantly exploring where his art could go, and filled with the hope that this would inspire others do the same. In a statement after his death, the Clean’s US label, Merge Records, said Hamish had “produced one of the most important and timeless bodies of work in rock music” and as a drummer had a “instantly recognisable style and an understated power”.

Bernstein, the son of Jewish-Ukrainian immigrants to the US, was a hugely talented conductor and composer, best known for writing the music for West Side Story as well as composing three symphonies and becoming music director of the New York Philharmonic. Cooper, who directs, co-writes and stars in Maestro, is not Jewish, and can be seen in the trailer with a noticeably prominent fake nose opposite Carey Mulligan, who plays Bernstein’s wife Felicia Montealegre. British actor and activist Tracy-Ann Obermann criticised Cooper on social media, writing: “If [Cooper] needs to wear a prosthetic nose then that is, to me and many others, the equivalent of Black-Face or Yellow-Face … if Bradley Cooper can’t [play the role] through the power or acting alone then don’t cast him – get a Jewish Actor.” Obermann added, referencing Cooper’s performance on stage in 2014 as John Merrick in The Elephant Man: “Bradley Cooper managed to play the ELEPHANT MAN without a single prosthetic then he should be able to manage to play a Jewish man without one.” The Hollywood Reporter’s chief TV critic Daniel Fienberg called the prosthetics “problematic” when photos from the set emerged in May, and subsequently described the film as “ethnic cosplay”. In a statement posted on social media, Bernstein’s children Jamie, Alexander, and Nina defended Cooper, saying: “It breaks our hearts to see any misrepresentations or misunderstandings of [Cooper’s] efforts … Bradley chose to use makeup to amplify his resemblance, and we’re perfectly fine with that. We’re also certain that our dad would have been fine with it as well.” The controversy follows objections to the casting of Cillian Murphy as nuclear physicist J Robert Oppenheimer – again, a non-Jewish actor playing a notable Jewish figure – in the biopic directed by Christopher Nolan, with David Baddiel describing such casting as “complacent” and “doubl[ing] down” on “Jewish erasure”. Baddiel also criticised the casting of Helen Mirren as Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, writing in the Guardian that “over a period of extreme intensification of the progressive conversation about representation and inclusion and microaggression and what is and isn’t offensive to minorities, one minority – Jews – has been routinely neglected”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T16:40:33Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: bank on improving Our Power to lift Newbury’s Gold Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2022/nov/25/talking-horses-bank-on-improving-our-power-to-lift-newbury-gold-cup-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"bodyText":"The first running of Newbury’s most historic handicap chase in its new guise as the Coral Gold Cup is one of the most competitive renewals this century, with no fewer than five horses top-priced as 8-1 co-favourites on Friday morning and four more a point behind on 9-1. Remastered, a faller four out when going like the winner 12 months ago, may prove to be the pick of the market leaders, but despite the strength and depth of the field, it is a surprise to find Our Power (3.05) at a double-figure price a little further down the list. Sam Thomas’s seven-year-old was steadily progressive last season and put up a new career-best to win the London Gold Cup at Ascot in October, posting an excellent time in the process. Our Power remains unexposed beyond three miles, is proven on good ground and is an excellent bet at around 12-1 to give both Thomas and Sam Twiston-Davies, his jockey, a first win in this race. Newbury 1.20 Paul Nicholls had Kapcorse – who carries the famous colours of the late Sir Peter O’Sullevan – ready to win this race run in O’Sullevan’s memory first time up last year and a 6lb rise in the weights may not be enough to prevent a repeat performance. Newcastle 1.35 Malinello has a long absence to overcome on his chasing debut but Ben Pauling has an impressive record with horses returning from a layoff and the seven-year-old’s brief hurdling career in 2020-21 suggests his opening mark is more than fair. Newbury 1.55 Lightly-raced mare West Balboa has excellent prospects of making a winning handicap debut off 127 having finished within seven lengths of Stage Star in last year’s Challow Hurdle over track and trip. Newcastle 2.10 Seven days later than planned, Constitution Hill returns to action with at least a stone in hand of his field on Timeform’s ratings and anything other than a third Grade One win from four starts over hurdles will be one of the shocks of the season. Newbury 2.30 Nicky Henderson has two runners as he looks for a third win in this race in four years and Theatre Glory, an impressive winner off an 8lb lower mark at Kelso in March, could be the pick of them with useful conditional Nathan Brennan taking off 7lb. Newcastle 3.25 A tough assignment for L’Homme Presse, last season’s Brown Advisory Novice Chase winner at Cheltenham, as he returns to action in a handicap off a mark of 164. At the likely odds, Into Overdrive looks a better bet at around 4-1, as he gets 22lb from the favourite and has the benefit of a run this season. Newbury 3.40 Amarillo Sky has returned in excellent form and should follow up his recent win at Cheltenham’s November meeting. Champ beats Paisley Park in thriller Champ and Paisley Park, the veterans in a five-horse field, produced a memorable finish to the Grade Two Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury on Friday, with Champ holding the late charge of his fellow 10-year-old, Paisley Park, by a neck ahead of what is likely to be a rematch in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in three weeks’ time. Champ set out to make all the running under Jonjo O’Neill jnr and looked set for a straightforward success as Paisley Park came under pressure on the run to the second-last. The former Stayers’ Hurdle winner kept finding more for Aidan Coleman, however, and the gap between the two horses was down to less than two lengths at the final flight. They were separated by the width of the track as Paisley Park continued to eat into Champ’s lead all the way to the line, but Nicky Henderson’s runner had just enough in the tank to get over the line. “Our old boy has won an RSA Chase over fences and everybody adores him,” Henderson told Racing TV afterwards. “He’s got the most lovely character and he’s such a sweet horse. AP [McCoy] rode him in a gallop here 10 days ago and he thought he was in great form, but he does have his ailments as well. He’s a bit creaky, like all of us at that age. “You could see we were travelling and Paisley Park was off the bridle, but you can never write him off. You can never read Paisley Park, he might stand still at the start and still come and beat you. He’s a bizarre character, but he’s a phenomenal horse with a phenomenal team and I’m sure we’re going to meet again in three weeks’ time.” Henderson was completing a double after Jet Powered’s impressive 11-length success in the card’s novice hurdle, a performance which saw the five-year-old installed as an 8-1 chance for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March. The card’s Grade Two novice chase, meanwhile, produced a surprise as Sebastopol, the 22-1 outsider of four runners, stayed on strongly to beat Paul Nicholls’s Stage Star, the 2-7 favourite, by five lengths."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-25T14:44:41Z","webTitle":"Much of Ukraine still without power, heat and water after missile attacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/25/much-of-ukraine-without-power-heat-and-water-after-missile-attacks","fields":{"bodyText":"Much of Ukraine remained without electricity, heat and water two days after a devastating series of Russian missile attacks against the country’s civilian infrastructure. The Kyiv mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, said 60% of households in the city of 3 million had no power, and there were rolling blackouts around the country, as engineers struggled to repair transformers and transmission lines damaged or destroyed by cruise missiles on Wednesday. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said basic utilities were gradually being restored, but there were problems with water supplies in 15 regions. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said Russian strikes on critical infrastructure had killed at least 77 people since October. “Millions are being plunged into extreme hardship and appalling conditions of life by these strikes,” said Türk in a statement. “Taken as a whole, this raises serious problems under international humanitarian law, which requires a concrete and direct military advantage for each object attacked.” The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, did not deny that Russia was attacking Ukraine’s energy infrastructure but blamed Kyiv on the grounds it had not bowed to Russian demands, which he did not specify. Zelenskiy’s government has vowed not to accept peace terms that leave Russia in control of any Ukrainian territory. In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelenskiy said the attacks would not break the will of the Ukrainian population. “Together we endured nine months of full-scale war and Russia has not found a way to break us, and will not find one,” he said. The three nuclear power stations still under Ukrainian control were back in operation after an unprecedented complete shutdown on Wednesday. However, Petro Kotin, the head of the state nuclear energy company, Energoatom, told the Guardian that defects in turbogenerators meant that two reactors were not yet rejoined the power grid. Kotin did not say where the two affected reactors were. Kotin said that in the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which remains under Russian control, two of the six reactors were in standby mode, but had not yet been returned to the grid. Russian forces have continued to shell the southern city of Kherson two weeks after withdrawing their troops to the other side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian citizens being evacuated from the city because of the complete destruction of electricity, heat and water systems, have come under artillery fire as they attempt to leave.

The head of the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, who made the original claim, had insisted that his source was Musk himself. “Elon Musk told me he had spoken with Putin and the Kremlin directly about Ukraine,” Ian Bremmer said in a tweet after Musk’s tweeted denial. “He also told me what the kremlin’s red lines were. “I have been writing my weekly newsletter on geopolitics for 24 yrs. I write honestly without fear or favor and this week’s update was no different.” In a newsletter for Eurasia Group subscribers, Bremmer wrote that the Tesla CEO told him Putin was “prepared to negotiate”, but only if Crimea remained Russian, if Ukraine accepted a form of permanent neutrality, and Ukraine recognised Russia’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Such conditions would represent near-total Ukrainian capitulation at a time when their forces are on the offensive. In the newsletter, first reported by Vice News, Bremmer said Musk claimed to have been told by Putin that those war aims would be achieved “no matter what”, including the potential use of a nuclear weapon if Ukraine retook territory in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. Bremmer said Musk told him that “everything needed to be done to avoid that outcome”. On 3 October, Musk provoked worldwide outrage by tweeting a proposal along similar lines, suggesting that Crimea was essentially Russian, and that sham referendums in four other occupied Ukrainian provinces should be redone under UN supervision, with Russia leaving only if they lost the vote. He suggested Ukraine would pledge long-term neutrality and guarantee the water supply to Crimea. Musk put the proposals to an online vote, in which they were rejected. They were given prominence in Russian state media, but derided in Ukraine. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conducted a tongue-in-cheek poll of his own on “which Elon Musk” readers preferred: the one who supported Ukraine, or the one who supported Russia. Musk denied having talked to the Russian leader before floating his ideas. “I have spoken to Putin only once and that was about 18 months ago. The subject matter was space,” he said on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T10:00:55Z","webTitle":"Battersea power station: a giant that needs no grand gestures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/oct/09/battersea-power-station-redevelopment-wilkinson-eyre-a-giant-that-needs-no-grand-gestures","fields":{"bodyText":"The first thing that hits you is the scale. Have so many bricks ever been piled up like this anywhere else? It’s a cliff, a behemoth, a Babylonian monolith. Up close, you keep recalibrating your sense of proportion, like a confused camera lens, not quite believing what you see. Crowded though it is by high, dense, profit-seeking apartment blocks, they can’t shrink Battersea power station. The next thing you might notice is the bravura of its original architects, Giles Gilbert Scott and J Theo Halliday: the four pale chimney columns that carried nothing but plumes of smoke; the muscular hunching of its masonry; the insistent flutings and striations of its art deco, faintly Maya, ornament. There’s a play of rough and refined that continues inside, into its two old turbine halls, where pillars clad in handmade faience carry girders of much-riveted steel. There are two glorious control rooms – the 1930s version (Control Room A, a private events space) contains batteries of dials and knobs with a crystalline glazed ceiling worthy of an ocean liner’s ballroom; the 1950s Control Room B – a bar – offered a more futuristic proto-Tardis. Battersea power station is industry made civic. It’s a carbon-belching brute turned national monument that once burned 240 tons of coal per hour and electrified 20% of London, before entering a long retirement as the backdrop of album covers, films, fashion shoots and the everyday life of the capital. Also as the country’s biggest heritage problem, passing through British, Chinese, Irish and Malaysian owners, and numerous proposals by leading architects and consultancy teams, each trying to work out how to make a commercial proposition out of the expensive-to-fix hulk, which nonetheless was listed Grade II*. It was built in two phases, from 1929 to 1935 and from 1937 until wartime interruption in 1941, finally completed in 1955, and progressively decommissioned from 1975 to 1983. Then it was to be a theme park, and after that various combinations of retail, leisure, residential and office development. At one point there were to be Cirque de Soleil acrobats swooping over surprised shoppers from its high roofs; at another, a 300 metre-high “eco-dome” was to be built just outside the power station. In 2012, Chelsea Football Club proposed making it into a 60,000-seat stadium. Meanwhile, the condition of the building, left roofless after the failed theme park plan, became more and more parlous. It therefore spent more than 25 years working to full capacity, compared with the near 40 it has taken, until its reopening this month, to find a new use. The final answer to the question – how do you solve a problem like Battersea? – turns out to involve more than 100 shops, restaurants and cafes, a 1,400-person events venue, 254 apartments (more than £1m for a studio flat, £18m for a six-bedroom penthouse), plus more than 500,000 sq feet of office space, most of which has helpfully been taken by Apple. Those big apartment blocks on the station’s 42-acre site have helped the finances stack up, as has the 2012 decision by the then chancellor George Osborne to underwrite a nearby extension to London Underground’s Northern line with public money. The power station’s commercial desirability also benefits from proximity to Vauxhall and Nine Elms, where a riot of residential towers has gone up around the new American embassy. The conversion, by the architects Wilkinson Eyre for the consortium of Malaysian investors who now own the building and its surrounding site, is sober, especially compared with the histrionics of previous proposals. There’s a lot of angular black steel, riffing on the building’s industrial heritage, with respectful restoration of the fancy faience and the gorgeous control rooms, plus some memories of its former ruination – patches of knackered masonry and rusty metal left exposed; spidery steelwork holding up the fragile, cathedral-size window at its southern end. Occasional quirks, such as unusual angles arising from irregularities in the original structure, help stop the new architecture becoming too po-faced, and there are outbreaks of cautious fantasy, such as a hanging glass room that can move up and down and sideways with the help of the building’s old gantry crane. The biggest gee-whizz moment will be a lift up one of the 109-metre-high chimneys, with a panoramic view of London at the top. The design’s general restraint makes sense. When you’re dealing with something as magnificent as Battersea power station, one of those rare buildings that can properly be called an icon, who needs attention-seeking from the new stuff? Wilkinson Eyre’s work also helps the building hold its own against the shopping – retail has a way of swamping spaces with the generic glitz of glass balustrades and bright lighting, and by demanding that nothing gets between consumers and products. Here the architecture wins: the handsome old pillars, for example, come firmly down to earth, with shop units fitted between them. The architects’ sensible approach doesn’t work so well with the new apartments, which are fitted into parts of the power station’s perimeter and stacked up on its roofs, looking on to gardens high off the ground. Here, the normality of the architecture doesn’t do justice to the fact that these mews in the air are actually abnormal, while their glass walls make for awkward intimacies between the shared gardens and private interiors. The situation here is extraordinary, but the design seems to wish it wasn’t. The restoration of the power station has come at a cost. The decades of desperation and site-flipping have driven down some of the public benefits that might have come with a development this size, and pushed up the amount of profitable floor space. Successive owners argued that they couldn’t possibly afford to save the historic building without significant concessions from the planners. Thus provision of affordable housing, on a site just off that of the power station development, is 9%, which compares with 15% allocated in the 2010 planning application and the 50% that was aimed for by policy at the time. The Northern Line extension, before Osborne’s intervention, was to have been funded directly by the developers. The surrounding blocks were permitted at a height where they obscure the historic building from several directions, which is definitely not desirable in planning terms. You could certainly wish that Wandsworth borough council and the London mayoralty had been more robust in their planning negotiations with present and past owners of the site. The project as whole also creates a highly managed territory of the sort that you tend to get in single-owner developments which, despite some funky moves by a Frank Gehry-designed apartment block, is fundamentally predictable. It threatens to cage the beast that is Gilbert Scott’s masterpiece, as might the array of retail logos inside. But, between the blandscape outside and the brandscape within, the power station is cussed enough to assert its own character. Yet it is still a cause for celebration that one of the most remarkable buildings of the 20th century has been saved and that its interiors, for the first time, are open to the public. Its eventual survival demonstrates, among other things, the relative strength of heritage in British planning – normal commercial logic and standard considerations of value for money give way to the needs of the monument. Which, in relation to Battersea power station, is welcome. It stands in striking contrast to the visual and spatial anarchy down the Thames at Vauxhall and Nine Elms. If only some of the thoughtfulness applied to old buildings could be applied to the planning of new ones, we might be getting somewhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T18:25:50Z","webTitle":"Russia’s Wagner Group ‘have as much power in Kremlin as ministers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/01/russias-wagner-group-have-as-much-power-in-kremlin-as-ministers","fields":{"bodyText":"The leaders of the Wagner Group, the Russian mercenary group answerable to Vladimir Putin, now have as much political influence in the Kremlin as the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, a prominent Russian dissident and former political prisoner has told a British parliamentary group. Mikhail Khodorkovsky told the foreign affairs committee that Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman who finally admitted in September 2022 that he had founded the group, had as much access to Putin as the formal government officials. He said Prigozhin was behind the recent appointment of General Sergey Surovikin to head the military operation in Ukraine and was working in close conjunction with him in Ukraine. Wagner Group’s popularity in Russia had surged in recent months since it was able to argue that its existence acted as an alternative to wider mobilisation, Khodorkovsky said. However, he added that the Wagner Group, with only roughly 7,000 forces, would not take the blame if the military operations failed in Ukraine, since the Russian forces are 150,000 to 200,000. The two that will take the blame will be Yury Kovalchuk, Putin’s financier and Shoigu, the men believed to have most often pressed Putin to launch the invasion and predicted Kyiv could be seized in three days. Khodorkovsky accused Putin of using mercenary forces such as the Wagner Group, which often recruits people from prisons, because it allowed him to lie, deny responsibility and implement an illegal foreign policy. “They are engaged in terrorism and killing”, he said, adding the UK and other countries had been too slow to proscribe the group as such despite its clear “terrorist” activity in Africa. Restarting troop conscription would be a very dangerous political decision for Putin, Khodorkovsky said, adding that resistance to the mobilisation had forced him to bring the process to a premature end. He claimed 700,000 people had left Russia after the mobilisation and said this represented “a serious blow to Putin’s defence industry and for the economy of Russia”, potentially a more significant blow to Russia’s economy than any normal sanctions imposed by the west. Khodorkovsky urged the UK to take in many of these Russian exiles saying: “These people are the most active and educated people with certain financial means including 30,000 Russian programmers mainly based in Cyprus. It has significantly hit Russia’s ability to pursue the cyber war.” Similarly, he said many Russian engineers needed for the reproduction of high-precision weapons had left the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T16:12:54Z","webTitle":"The power of detail and description: A creative writing weekend with Jem Poster and Sarah Burton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/feb/02/detail-and-description-a-creative-writing-masterclass-with-jem-poster-and-sarah-burton","fields":{"bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

Russia’s soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Jeremy Fleming is expected to add in a rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it’s clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. On Monday, Moscow launched a wave of missile strikes aimed at Kyiv and other major urban centres, killing at least 11 people, which Putin said was in response to the weekend bombing of the bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia. Western intelligence has repeatedly emphasised how it believes that Putin has micromanaged the conduct of Russian forces in the seven-month-long war. Last month US officials said it was thought the president had rejected a request from his generals to retreat from the city of Kherson on the west of the Dnieper River. But although intelligence officials believe there is increasing anxiety within the Kremlin at the progress of the war, Putin’s position is thought to remain strong. In the unlikely event he was to be suddenly replaced it is not certain it would result in a significant change in Russian strategy, either. The GCHQ director will highlight the costs to Russia from the months of fighting, arguing that Moscow’s forces have become exhausted and its recent mobilisation of conscripts shows signs of desperation. “We know – and Russian commanders on the ground know – that their supplies and munitions are running out,” he will add. Fleming is also expected to speak about the future threat posed by China, according to a pre-released extract of the remarks he will make in front of a specialist audience at the Rusi thinktank on Tuesday afternoon. Beijing’s efforts to exploit the control and surveillance capabilities in emerging technologies represents “a threat to us all” that must be tackled by concerted western action, Fleming will say, reflecting a widely held intelligence view that it is China rather than Russia that is the long-term challenger to the west. Characterising the situation as “a sliding doors moment in our history”, Fleming warned that in particular China was seeking to control or influence technologies such as satellite systems and digital currencies in line with its authoritarian politics and, where possible, spread them internationally. Beijing has been seeking to launch a central bank digital currency in an attempt to boost the use of the yuan in international transactions. But Fleming said it could be used to allow China to “partially evade the sort of international sanctions currently being applied to Putin’s regime in Russia” if Beijing were to attempt to invade Taiwan. The spy chief also highlighted China’s promotion of its own BeiDou satellite navigation system, an alternative to the US GPS and the EU’s Galileo. “Many believe that China is building a powerful anti-satellite capability, with a doctrine of denying other nations access to space in the event of a conflict,” Fleming will say, adding: “There are fears the technology could be used to track individuals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-02T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Beijing Rules by Bethany Allen review – a new world order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","fields":{"bodyText":"It can be a little dizzying to survey the abrupt shifts in Britain’s relationship with China. It is less than eight years since the then chancellor, George Osborne, touted a “golden era” of closer ties, becoming the first serving cabinet minister to visit Xinjiang. That region is now synonymous with the persecution of Uyghurs and other minorities, its vast network of camps a modern-day gulag archipelago. The widely documented atrocities meted out include torture and forced sterilisation. Last month parliament warned that Beijing poses not just a commercial challenge, but an “existential threat” to our democracy. The whiplash in Britain may be particularly extreme, but most western countries have charted a similar policy course over the last decade, slowly coming to the realisation that the neoliberal consensus forged after the fall of the Berlin Wall – that economic opening would lead to political reform – might be wrong. All this makes Beijing Rules a timely read. Bethany Allen, a Tapei-based reporter for Axios, documents how China has wielded extraordinary power beyond its own borders, exploiting western naivety and greed, and weaponising its own fast-growing economy in a bid to reshape the world order. Part of this includes stifling dissent not just at home but abroad; she describes in chilling detail how the online meeting platform Zoom, flush with pandemic cash and success, helped Beijing go after US-based dissidents, arguing that its actions were necessary to comply with Chinese law. The company handed over information stored on US servers about Zoom users connected to Xinjiang and disrupted a meeting about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, even though it was hosted by a US citizen – former student leader Wang Dan – who was in the US at the time. Wang told Allen: “It kind of hurt the democracy in the United States. It’s not only an attack on Chinese dissidents. It’s an attack on American society. Because Zoom is an American company.” (Zoom said a China-based executive was fired over the incident for “violating company policies” and has subsequently said that it will not allow any requests from the Chinese government to affect anyone outside China.) Parts of the book feel like familiar if useful surveys of issues that have been prominent in news coverage over recent years, including the Chinese response to the Covid pandemic, the ramping up of disinformation, and Beijing’s reaction to the 2019 Hong Kong protest movement. Allen shows how Beijing has deployed de facto “sanctions” on industries as diverse as Norway’s salmon fisheries and America’s NBA when governments, companies or individuals cross its red lines. But there are also sections that are likely to be startling to most readers, including one on China’s covert political operations overseas. Much of this activity comes under the auspices of the blandly named United Front Work Department, an organisation charged with increasing the Communist party’s influence in wider society. Too often it has been dismissed as a dull bureaucratic relic. But its budget, estimated at between $1.4bn and $1.8bn, is testament to its importance. Its activities range from the apparently absurd to the terrifying, whether that’s trying to manipulate twin-cities programmes or placing a suspected spy at the heart of the US intelligence community. Lest that sounds too depressing, Beijing Rules also charts how governments from Canberra to Berlin to Ottawa woke up to the threat staring them in the face – albeit belatedly – and ends with a list of suggestions for protecting democracy that reads more like a manifesto than a policy paper. Allen makes a powerful case for more coordinated western intervention, to both support companies in the face of Chinese competition and coercion, and force them to respect the liberal values that have made our economies so powerful in the first place. Because even the biggest corporations are smaller than the Chinese state and its economy, they can be picked off fairly easily when standing alone. “There’s nothing wrong with shaming a US company for investing in Xinjiang or self-censoring to please Beijing. But purely placing the blame on individual commercial actors for succumbing to the innovative economic statecraft of a trade superpower is misguided,” she writes. “Through new laws, regulations, and multilateral institutions, we need to relink economic and democratic rights, both domestically and internationally.” Allen also manages the feat – more difficult than it should be, to judge by the way too many people write and speak – of untangling legitimate concerns about the Chinese government’s behaviour from the disturbing rise in racism towards people of East Asian heritage. This discrimination was almost certainly one reason many casual observers, particularly on the left, failed to understand, appreciate or support important policy shifts in the US during the Trump administration. Chinese citizens abroad, and people of Chinese heritage, are “the first and the last victims of this dynamic,” she writes. “They are caught in the middle, between a powerful Leninist state with expansive global aims on the one hand and the legitimate fears and illegitimate fear mongering and racism that simmer in host countries on the other.” If the past 10 years have been a time of slow awakening to reality – namely that, amid talk of a second cold war, this confrontation with an autocratic superpower will be more complicated and difficult than the last – Allen remains optimistic that the next decade will see liberal democracies try to use that new understanding to defend themselves and their values. As her carefully assembled argument demonstrates, it’s essential that they do. • Beijing Rules: China’s Quest for Global Influence by Bethany Allen is published by John Murray.

America’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed just over a year ago, will pour at least US$370bn (A$570bn) into clean energy programs. Groups such as the Clean Energy Council warn the program “has the potential to permanently tilt the scales toward the US and hamper our progress in Australia”. “In the global energy transition, the best talent will be mobile,” the council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said. “The success of our own energy transition relies on making the case that Australia is an attractive place to call home and our commitment to renewable energy is solid.” Jane MacMaster, the chief engineer at Engineers Australia, said the looming skills shortage was raised by many speakers at an energy transition summit in Sydney last week. “It’s a fantastic time to be an engineer but it’s also a very busy time,” MacMaster said. “There’s definitely a challenge in the supply of the engineering workforce at the moment, and it’s pretty much across all sectors and almost all disciplines of the profession.” MacMaster said the IRA was drawing US engineers home as well as those from elsewhere. Several nations were considering launching countermeasures that could further challenge the appeal of working in Australia. “Australia is competing with other countries [and] our states are competing with each other,” she said. A confluence of national priorities – from transitioning to net zero emissions, to building up sovereign manufacturing capability including for nuclear submarines – was stoking the need for engineers and other technology workers. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “We need 60,000 more graduate engineers in the next 10 years just to replace … the engineers that we think will retire”, MacMaster said. Local universities now only produce about 7,500 four-year graduates annually, many of whom get snapped up by banks or management consultancies. The IRA’s impact on Australia’s renewables race is ill-timed. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week said 62% of the coal-fired power stations in the national electricity market were forecast to close by 2033, requiring “imminent and urgent investment” in new energy sources. Major projects that are under way, such as the now $12bn Snowy Hydro 2.0 pumped hydro plan, have also struggled with complexity and cost overruns. Developers such as Transgrid, which is building the now $5bn HumeLink to connect Snowy 2.0 to the main power grid, are hoping the federal government’s $20bn Rewiring the Nation plan will bolster Australia’s chances in a global race for skilled labour, material and equipment. “Many major infrastructure projects are under way across Australia, which is squeezing limited resources,” a Transgrid spokesperson said. “As the demand for clean energy continues to grow, the ongoing transformation of our energy system requires an urgent focus on upskilling tens of thousands of workers to address skills shortages,” he said. Transgrid alone expects to require hundreds of electrical design, commissioning, civil and asset engineers over the next five to 10 years. The company is investing millions of dollars in training and development and partnering with Charles Sturt and Newcastle universities to help meet demand, he said. MacMaster said her organisation detailed the issues facing the profession last year. Only about 60% of the 400,000 or so qualified engineers in Australia work in an engineering role. Australia has long relied on importing engineers, with about 62% of those qualified born overseas. In the past five years, 82,000 of the 115,000 additional engineering jobs – or 71% – were filled by overseas talent. MacMaster said the number of students studying intermediate or advanced maths was in steep decline while the standard of maths education was also on the skids. Australia had also dropped from 13th in the 38-nation OECD’s program for international student assessment in 2003 to 30th by 2018, she said. Women, too, only made up about 18% of student engineers and 14% of the qualified engineering workforce, underscoring one area of potential future growth. Australia may also fill some of the gaps by hiring more engineering technologists, with three-year degrees, or two-year engineering associates. “It’s a bit of a win-win situation – for those people who aren’t necessarily inclined to study as advanced levels of maths as required of professional engineers,” MacMaster said. “But we need industry to create the demand for them to incentivise more [universities] to offer these places.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-08T05:00:14Z","webTitle":"Powerful Ansel Adams show centers his love for nature – and the peril it’s in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/07/ansel-adams-photography-exhibition-san-francisco-nature","fields":{"bodyText":"From towering granite monoliths to textured tree trunks, Ansel Adams’s renowned black and white photographs have offered generations the chance to see the beauty and importance of nature through his eyes. Now a new exhibit at San Francisco’s de Young fine arts museum gives viewers a new way to connect to the artist himself. Ansel Adams in Our Time, on display from 8 April through 23 July, brings together more than a 100 of Adams’s works alongside 23 contemporary photographers who reflect and build on it. The exhibition also returns Adams to the city where he launched his career and continues the conversations he began about conservation and national parks in his first exhibition at San Francisco’s de Young museum nearly a century ago. The exhibition will include some of Adams’s most famous works, including a photograph of Half Dome under the moon and a beloved self-portrait featuring the artist’s shadow – complete with his arm extended to the sky, light meter in hand – against a rock face in Monument Valley. Alongside, the gallery walls will also portray perspectives from new artists whose photos build on Adams’s work while seeking broader reflections on the natural world and the way people engage and impact it. These include collages created by Mark Klett and Byron Wolfe, who layer photographs from Adams and others over more modern captures, leaving viewers with panoramic views of Yosemite through time. Catherine Opie’s photographs sharply contrasts Adams by casting similar subjects in a colored blur while CJ Heyliger, the exhibit’s youngest artist, showcased beauty in the mundane by focusing on details in landscapes less sought after, like glass scattered across the desert. “It is great to see contemporary photographers taking up his legacy and looking at it, criticizing it, and finding new ways to approach these problems that Adams was addressing in his photographs years ago,” said Sarah Mackay, an assistant curator for the show. ‘Ahead of his time’ A master technician, Adams stewarded his images through an arduous photographic process, starting with lugging large cameras up steep terrain, enduring long waits for good light, and finally the metered dance – set to the beat of the metronome he once relied on as a musician – of darkroom development that granted him ultimate control over the final outcome. But in his writings and recordings, Adams credits his impact not to his technique, but to his eye. “The whole world is, to me, very much ‘alive,’ all the little growing things, even the rocks,” Adams once wrote. “I can’t look at a swell bit of grass and earth, for instance, without feeling the essential life – the things going on – within them,” he said. “The same goes for a mountain, or a bit of the ocean, or a magnificent piece of old wood.” His work has taken on renewed urgency as the iconic locations he photographed across the American west – including Death Valley, Grand Teton and Yosemite – grapple with a changing climate. Positioning Adams’s work alongside that of contemporary environmental artists offers visitors a new framing of the climate crisis and the importance of conservation. “The thing I find so exciting is realizing how ahead of his time Ansel Adams was in terms of thinking about these issues,” said Karen Haas, lane senior curator of Photographs Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Adams is perhaps most associated with Yosemite national park, and his images of its sweeping views and soaring granite slabs through the seasons helped shape the park’s identity while it in turn shaped him as a photographer. Armed with what he called the “spiritual-emotional” connection to the park and other wild landscapes, Adams’s portrayal helped ensure the national parks would remain protected places. In 1975 he took his message to the White House, gifting President Gerald Ford with a print of Yosemite. “Now, Mr President, every time you look at this picture,” he urged, “I want you to remember your obligation to the national parks.” National parks in peril Today those parks remain cherished but also in peril, caught between the pressures of extreme weather and surging tourism. Photography that spurred appreciation for the wilderness has also helped flood these areas with footsteps. Growing crowds and tourist-catering amenities are increasingly at odds with conservation efforts as parks push past their capacity. Adams saw the problems unfolding even in his time and often resisted what he called “resortism” in the parks and their development for public use. In his images he typically erases signs of people to offer a more pristine view of the landscapes. “We see Ansel Adams photographs and we don’t see them peopled,” Mackay said. “He is in some instances removing them from his photographs.” Yosemite – one of the most visited parks in the nation – is a quintessential example of the difficult balancing act between enabling access and ensuring the lands are preserved for generations to come. The past year has put the extreme seasonal swings that Yosemite faces on full display. In summer the park was shrouded in smoke from nearby wildfires, followed by a winter of snowstorms that closed down the park for weeks and damaged the winding mountain roads leading into the valley. The curators feel strongly that Adams would have had a perspective to share about how these issues have unfolded. That’s why, they said, including new artistic voices has elevated the potential for impact. “It’s bleak realizing how little has changed and how much work we still have to do,” said Haas reflecting on the enormous scale of problems posed by a warming world. But, she added, the exhibit has brought her hope, with its potential to both inspire awe and action. It’s a feeling she hopes viewers share. “With this exhibition we can finally put this great master in conversation,” she said, “and let these contemporary figures show us the concerns that continue today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/sep/01/florida-hurricane-idalia-cleanup-electricity-perry","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-01T15:13:24Z","webTitle":"‘What night really looks like’: lights out as Floridians clean up after Idalia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/01/florida-hurricane-idalia-cleanup-electricity-perry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/sep/01/florida-hurricane-idalia-cleanup-electricity-perry","fields":{"bodyText":"Hurricane Idalia left behind a trail of debris and floodwaters across Florida, but – as power cut out in its wake – it also left behind true darkness as night fell and electric lights remained out. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen it this dark,” said Lashawn Poitier of Perry, Florida, which was right in the path of the storm. “This is what night really looks like.” Poitier moved to Perry from Miami four months ago because she felt the small town was better suited to her 82-year-old mother, who has dementia. She thought about evacuating because of her mother, but eventually decided to stay put. After all, she said: “I’ve lived through hurricanes in Miami and south Florida, including Hurricane Andrew, which left my house and a handful of others standing in my neighborhood, so I felt we would be all right.” And they were until a huge oak tree fell through the roof and ceiling of her mother’s bedroom while her mother was in bed. “It nearly scared me to death when I heard this horrible crashing sound,” Poitier recounted, retracing her path from the living room to her mother’s bedroom. “I opened my mother’s bedroom door and saw my mother lying in bed with a fallen tree hanging over her.” Idalia has passed now, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and lives and homes that now need to be rebuilt. Poitier’s mother was shaken but physically unhurt, even though the tree limbs were hanging low enough to touch. “I think the whole thing scared me more than it scared her,” Poitier said. The category 3 storm made landfall on the coast of Taylor county near the community of Keaton Beach then cut an inland path through towns like Perry before heading back out into the Atlantic and up the eastern coast of Georgia and the Carolinas. Ahead of the hurricane, the Taylor county sheriff, Wayne Padgett, and the county’s emergency management department had issued mandatory evacuations of coastal county communities, including Steinhatchee, Keaton Beach and Dekle Beach. People living in mobile homes, campers and substandard housing were also ordered to evacuate. However, when the county decided to close its hurricane shelter at a local elementary school in Perry and transport people to shelters in Tallahassee, residents, like Sylvester Bellamy, knew the storm was going to be catastrophic. Bellamy, a Perry native, heeded the hurricane warnings and decided to evacuate with his family to Valdosta, Georgia. “Unfortunately, the hurricane’s path shifted, and we ended up evacuating into the hurricane’s path after it left Taylor county,” Bellamy said. “So, we had to wait for the hurricane to pass before we could come home and check on things.” Sitting in Valdosta through the hurricane, by then downgraded slightly to category 2, was extremely difficult for Bellamy because he had received word from home that his small vegetable stand on US Highway 19, where he often hangs out with family and friends, was severely damaged in the hurricane. “I’m just getting back to Perry,” Bellamy said. When asked if there was any damage to his home, he responded, “I haven’t been there yet. This was my first stop. I knew it was damaged, but I didn’t expect this,” he said. The entire front and part of the roof were torn off the building. “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” he said as he choked back tears. “I can even remember buying cookies and candy here when I was a boy, way before my daddy bought it. But I guess all I can do now is clean it up.” He walked back and forth, occasionally finding a memory in the rubble and a reason to smile. “I better go check on the house,” he said. “Without any power, it’s going to be really dark around here.” The darkness brought a glimmer of hope when the red lights began to flash at one of the town’s busiest intersections. “Thank God,” Poitier shouted when she saw the red lights turn green. “They’re working on the electricity.” Her excitement was short-lived after her companion asked: “You don’t hear those generators?” “The traffic light is on,” Poitier responded. “How doesn’t matter right now.” Before the night ended, several traffic lights in the town were back in operation – though all were powered by generators."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Russian assault on Ukraine’s power grid is the strategy of nihilism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s cynical decision to target Ukraine’s network of hydroelectric power stations on Monday represents a further, dispiriting, escalation in its efforts to destroy the country’s power supply. The electricity network is reeling from three weeks of attacks focused on coal- and gas-fired power stations and, above all, the electricity substations that link up different parts of the grid. Power cuts are the new normal as winter looms. It may not be clear how damaging Monday’s attacks involving the two hydro plants on the Dnieper River and a third on the western Dniester are, but their targeting suggests Russia intends to push further in its attempts bomb Ukraine into darkness: before the war, hydro contributed about 14% of the country’s energy capacity. At the same time, Ukraine has warned that Russia has mined the Nova Kakhovka dam in the occupied south of the country and that its retreating forces may yet destroy it to cover a retreat from Kherson. Moscow has warned that Ukraine may blow up the dam across the Dnieper River, although some pro-Russian bloggers published animated maps to show how serious the disruption could be downriver. It is almost certain that Monday’s attacks will be followed up, and for all Ukraine’s claimed success in knocking out 44 out of 50 incoming missiles, the reality remains that a minority continue to get through to damage strategically vital targets. Cutting electricity supplies may have some impact on Ukraine’s military, which has a battlefield momentum that the Kremlin is desperate to halt, but it is obvious that the most serious consequences will be faced by civilians at risk of being without electricity and other utilities in a country where winter temperatures can plunge to -20C. John Lough, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, warns that “this has the potential to be very painful for the civilian population” but that it is likely “to encourage Ukrainians to dig in more and accept that Russia has chosen to victimise them and inflict the maximum pain possible”. Bombing, however terrifying, is a military tactic that has a poor record of changing hearts and minds. It was used heavily in the Vietnam war, for instance, but failed to stem the overall resolve of the North Vietnamese, and if the Russians are any students of history, they will know its limitations. But Russia probably does not care. Its strategy is also aimed at the west: a shameless attempt to prompt a fresh flow of several million migrants across the border. Ukraine has been trying to ask refugees already abroad not to return this winter to help protect the energy supply. “The networks will not cope,” said the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, last week. At the same time, Russia hopes to increase the costs of supporting Ukraine, which imported energy from Europe on a test basis for the first time last week. Historically, Ukraine has enjoyed an energy surplus. Now it may need to buy supplies at a time when its treasury is short due to the demands of fighting Russia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently estimated that Ukraine needs to borrow between $3bn and $4bn (£2.6bn and £3.5bn) a month to get through next year, but warned that Kyiv’s need for financial support could rise further if “social and infrastructure requirements” increase – in other words if the war damage worsens in a war that is likely to last into next year at least. Ukraine and its allies have to be braced for the longer haul, and be ready to focus on further humanitarian support, mindful of the fact that the Kremlin has embraced nihilism as its primary method of warfare. Or as Lough puts it: “If Putin can’t take Ukraine, he’ll wreck it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T17:35:06Z","webTitle":"EDF considers extending life of two UK nuclear plants due to energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s EDF is considering extending the life of two British nuclear power plants due to the severity of the energy crisis. EDF said on Wednesday that it would review whether there was a case to keep open the Hartlepool nuclear power plant in County Durham and Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster. Both plants had been scheduled to close in March 2024. EDF operates all of Britain’s eight nuclear power plants, five of which are still providing power to the grid, about 13% of the UK’s electricity. The entire fleet is due to shut by 2028 apart from Sizewell B, which will close in 2035. When EDF took over the nuclear fleet in 2009, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were due to run until 2014. After technical reviews, that was extended to 2019 and then, in 2016, a further five-year extension was approved after further reviews. Sources said any extra lifespan for the stations was likely to be far shorter than previous extensions. The stations – which produce 2.2 gigawatts of power, enough to power 3.5m homes – have been operational for four decades. EDF said it had decided to launch the review “in light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections” and said an extension would “depend on the results of graphite inspections over the coming months”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked turmoil in energy markets and sent gas and electricity prices soaring. It has also caused an international dash for gas supplies and raised concerns over potential blackouts this winter. The government has moved to shore up winter energy supplies, signing deals to keep coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire and the east Midlands on standby including EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “The government has had no option but to keep these plants on longer term. It underlines that we need a long-term plan for energy generation. We’re a decade late on nuclear and if we don’t move fast enough we will miss the boat on other fuels, like hydrogen. The government needs to give people the confidence to invest.” Some power-generation companies, including those on nuclear, old solar and windfarm contracts have landed an unexpected windfall from the jump in electricity prices while their costs have not risen, triggering calls for a windfall tax. EDF said its nuclear fleet would generate 42 terawatt hours of power in 2022. It said that, because it had sold its output in advance, it had delivered at “well below current wholesale prices”. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Centrica, which owns a 20% stake in the nuclear fleet alongside EDF, wants to renegotiate its electricity-generation contracts. Tom Burke, co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, said: “In the current climate it makes a lot of sense [to extend the plants’ lifespans]. The question is mainly about the cost: is the extra time you’re buying worth the cost of keeping it safe? The Office for Nuclear Regulation are not going to play fast and loose with safety so then it depends on the spend. With electricity prices where they are now it probably does make sense.” EDF said it plans to invest £1bn in the nuclear fleet from 2023 to 2025. The debt-laden company, which is being fully nationalised by the French government, is developing the delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. It is also behind plans for a sister station, Sizewell C, in Suffolk, which was given the green light in the final days of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Getting the most out of our existing nuclear stations is vital to ensuring Britain has a secure supply of power going forward.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Tuesday pledged to launch Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, if elected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T01:01:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 165 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after it was hit by shelling, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was “extremely concerned” by reports of damage as Zelenskiy accused Russia of using the plant “for terror”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, according to British intelligence. “The heaviest fighting [will shift] to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper river,” the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the buildup is not yet clear, UK intelligence warned. The Ministry of Defence said Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply in Ukraine’s southern regions, the ministry added. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started in February, to be loaded with grain. The Ukrainian infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the Barbados-flagged general cargo ship Fulmar S was in the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk and Ukraine planned to “reach the level of at least three to five vessels per day in two weeks’ [time]”. Horrific video and photos appear to show a fresh atrocity with remains of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. “There is nothing human about the Russians. We are at war with non-humans,” said the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death inside a Russian detention centre outside Donetsk, while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, a former prisoner has said. Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur, was trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol when she was arrested and held on charges of “terrorism”. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency has said. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A Russian journalist has reportedly been arrested at the border on suspicion that she could be a spy, Kosovo’s interior minister said on Saturday. Xhelal Svecla named the journalist as Daria Aslamova. “Many countries have proven that she was engaged in espionage for Russian military intelligence and that she pretended to be a journalist,” Svecla said. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Kherson was gravely wounded on Saturday in an attempted assassination, local Moscow-backed officials said. Vitaly Gur “is in hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, in a critical state”, an unnamed official told Russian state news agency Tass. Meta, formerly named Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed after the report found that about $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T12:30:13Z","webTitle":"The staying power of ‘King Bibi’, Israel’s scandal-ridden political behemoth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","fields":{"bodyText":"Don’t call it a comeback. Benjamin Netanyahu was booted from office last summer by a broad coalition united by their distaste for the conservative Likud leader. But after Tuesday’s election – an unprecedented fifth poll in less than four years – the short-lived “government of change” is probably going to prove no more than a brief intermission in the political behemoth’s long career. With 80% of votes counted on Wednesday, but official results not due until next week, Bibi, as he is commonly known, appears the most likely candidate to form a new government. Several small leftwing parties may yet clear the electoral threshold, erasing his rightwing religious bloc’s lead of 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. But even if that happens, Netanyahu still would not be out of the running. Coalition horse-trading could last for weeks, and if it failed, a sixth election would be held next year. Israel’s political crisis since 2019 was triggered by allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against Netanyahu, whose last stint as prime minister lasted 12 years. He has denied all the charges in his ongoing corruption trial, but the case has polarised Israeli society. To his ardent supporters, “King Bibi” is a strong, tested leader unfairly prosecuted by a biased establishment. To detractors, his vilification of the judicial system has undermined trust in public institutions and the rule of law, paving the way for the astonishing rise of his new far-right ally, the Religious Zionist party, which doubled its number of seats. Many from across the political spectrum had hoped that the 73-year-old would eventually stop standing for the good of the politically fractured country. But it was never likely he would give up. Netanyahu’s probable success is mostly thanks to the Religious Zionists, formerly three fringe extremist parties that he persuaded to merge into one slate before the 2021 election. In doing so, he may have opened Pandora’s box. This time round, its radical ideas – expelling “disloyal” Palestinian citizens of Israel and annexing the occupied West Bank – have been greeted with enthusiasm from an increasingly rightwing Israeli public. The former prime minister insists it is nothing to do with him that his new ally has proposed sweeping changes to the penal code that would help get his trial thrown out. “Over his previous two stints in office, Bibi has preferred to form coalitions with centrist or centre-left parties, but he’s made too many enemies and broken too many promises for that to happen again now,” said Eran Amsalem, an assistant professor of communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “He’s stuck with the far right, whether he likes it or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T15:59:17Z","webTitle":"How important is Horizon science project for UK – and could it rejoin?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK is edging closer to a deal to allow it back into the flagship £85bn Horizon Europe science research programme after being locked out since 2020 in a row over Northern Ireland’s Brexit trading arrangements. What might happen, and can British science recover its leading position in Europe? Was there any point to the row? Debatable. Scientists had nothing to do with the Northern Ireland protocol and the issue had little political capital. Arguably, the only losers were in the sector itself. Is it over? Not yet. The UK is close to a deal, sources say, speculating that there could be an announcement on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, next Tuesday. What does the UK say? Downing Street said a deal had not been agreed between the UK and the EU on the Horizon Europe research programme. Rishi Sunak’s official spokesperson said the prime minister was keen to seek “value for money for taxpayers” if the UK was to rejoin the scheme, with “constructive” discussions still going on. “It doesn’t affect just the past two years, but also the future value that the UK will get from these programmes, and the UK would be a net contributor to the Horizon programme if the decision were made to take that approach. So obviously there are issues that we are discussing and that we continue to discuss with the EU, and we will consider next steps.” The EU also says negotiations are continuing. What is the issue? Money. The government is concerned that confidence is so weakened in the science sector that the money it pays in will not be matched by awards and it will end up being a net loser. What do scientists say? They agree that confidence has taken a knock, but say there is no reason why applications to the fund will not recover with the UK taking a leading role in the programme once again. Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said returning to the programme would be “a huge relief”. Can the loss be quantified? EU data shows that in 2019, €959.3m went to the UK in 1,364 grants, compared with €22.18m in 192 grants in 2023 to date. How important was that money? There is nothing that matched the scale of Horizon 2020 for scientific research and innovation. The programme had €100bn (£85bn) to fund projects from 2021 to 2027. These aim to tackle many of the most pressing questions the world faces, from dealing with climate change and protecting the oceans to fighting terminal diseases and improving food and energy security. Britain has historically received far more back than it has contributed to EU research programmes. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed nearly £4.3bn towards EU research projects and received nearly £7bn in grants. The £2.7bn excess amounted to more than £300m in research funds each year. A major report in 2016 found that pre-Brexit, scientific and medical research in the UK was substantially propped up by EU grants, with crucial work on cancer, computing, nanotechnology and engineering all heavily reliant on the funds. European grants made up more than 40% of public money poured into cancer research and 62% of public money spent on nanotechnology research, the report found. Only 7% of funds from the EU and the European Research Council went to non-member states from 2006 to 2015. But could the UK not just fund its own scientists? It does. The UK Research and Innovation government fund guarantees that it will back scientists who would otherwise have relied on Horizon grants. But the science community argues it is not the same as international collaboration, and the sharing of findings is vital to accelerate advances. So what has happened in the past three years? A protracted political sulk rather than an official dispute after Lord Frost’s decision to unilaterally abandon some of the trading arrangements (since removed under the Windsor framework) relating to Northern Ireland. Associate membership, due by normal standards in spring or early summer of 2021, was never ratified by the EU. It was simply delayed in an informal retaliatory measure taken over the UK’s failure to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU never announced that it was withholding membership, and it wasn’t until May 2022 that a senior EU diplomat admitted that Horizon Europe “might be the victim of a political impasse”. Talks were only reopened in March 2023, when Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen agreed the new Windsor framework for Northern Ireland. Is particular research at risk? Doubts have been raised over whether the UK will seek access to Euratom, a parallel funding scheme for nuclear research and innovation, amid concerns that ministers do not consider Horizon good value for money. The programme operates on the same rules as Horizon Europe and aims to spend €1.4bn (£1.2bn) from 2021 to 2025. The funds will drive projects on nuclear fission, safety and radiation protection, but much of the investment is aimed at nuclear fusion, a potentially gamechanging source of green power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-31T16:28:05Z","webTitle":"Niger coup leaders accuse France of plotting military intervention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","fields":{"bodyText":"The military junta that seized power in Niger has accused France of plotting military intervention to reinstate the deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, as tensions in the region continued to grow in the wake of the coup. The junta said on national TV that France was searching “for ways and means to intervene militarily in Niger” and had held a meeting with the chief of staff of Niger’s national guard “to obtain the necessary political and military authorisation”. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, denied any alleged intention of military intervention in the west African country. “It’s wrong,” she told BFMTV news channel on Monday night, adding that it was still possible to return Niger’s democratically elected president to power. “And it’s necessary because destabilisation is perilous for Niger and its neighbours,” she said. Bazoum, an ally of western powers, was toppled on 26 July in a coup by Niger’s elite presidential guard. Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani declared himself leader but his claim has been shunned internationally. On Monday, Bazoum’s party said several ministers in his ousted government had been arrested, including the mines minister. Niger is the world’s seventh-biggest producer of uranium, the radioactive metal widely used for nuclear energy and treating cancer. The Chadian president, Mahamat Idriss Déby, who flew to Niger to try to mediate, on Monday posted what appeared to be the first images of Bazoum since the takeover, showing him smiling and apparently unharmed. Déby said he had met Bazoum and coup leader Tchiani to explore ways “to find a peaceful solution”, without going into further detail. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has given the junta a week to give back power, warning in a statement that if Bazoum was not reinstated it would take “all measures” to restore constitutional order, which “may include the use of force”. ECOWAS has suspended all commercial and financial transactions, while France, the EU and the US, which has about 1,000 troops in Niger, have either cut off support or threatened to do so. Germany suspended financial aid and development cooperation, and UN humanitarian operations have been put on hold. Russia called for the swift return of “the rule of law” and “restraint from all parties so that this doesn’t result in human casualties”. Niger, with a population of 26 million, frequently ranks at the bottom of the UN’s human development index benchmark of prosperity. The country, which became independent from France in 1960, is a landlocked state, and strict economic sanctions against it could affect many supplies, including electricity. The coup, according to the putschists, was a response to “the degradation of the security situation” linked to the jihadist conflict, as well as corruption and economic difficulties. As Niger struggles with two jihadist campaigns – one in the south-west, which swept in from Mali in 2015, and the other in the south-east, involving jihadists from north-eastern Nigeria – the coup has shone a spotlight on France’s reduced and contested military presence in the Sahel region of Africa after 10 years fighting jihadist insurgencies. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, chose unusually strong language towards the junta in Niger, vowing there would be “immediate and uncompromising” action if French citizens or interests were attacked, after thousands rallied outside the French embassy. News agencies reported anti-French and pro-Russian slogans were shouted at the rallies on Sunday, which were televised. Protesters, some carrying Russian flags, said France, the country’s traditional ally, had failed to shield them against the jihadists, whereas Russia would be a stronger ally. The coup is a serious threat to French strategy in the Sahel, after several military coups in other countries had already forced France to rethink its decade-long military presence and anti-jihadist mission. France first deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 under the Socialist president François Hollande, but in the past three years several military coups in the region, as well as a continued jihadist presence, have exposed the limitations of the military strategy and forced France to scale back its presence and focus its efforts in Niger, with Bazoum as a firm ally. It has 1,500 troops in the country and an airbase near Niamey. In Mali a coup in 2020 led to a diplomatic standoff with France, which withdrew its troops last year. France also quit Burkina Faso after two coups last year brought in a junta that adopted a nationalist line. Niagalé Bagayoko, a political scientist and defence expert, told France Inter radio that the G5 Sahel group of nations set up to combat jihadist insurgency now featured a majority of military juntas. She said France could not continue its military engagement in Niger under the current circumstances, adding that France had been rethinking its presence in the region for more than two years. She said foreign troops, including the US and other Europeans as well as the French, were seen as unpopular and people wanted their withdrawal. The writer and analyst Seidik Abba told France Inter that the broader problem for Paris was that the poor results of its military and security drive against jihadists had made France a scapegoat. He said the strategy in the Sahel had been a security and military one, when in fact “it wasn’t just a security and military issue, it was also a question of development, justice and governance”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T20:40:43Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: police investigate violent arrest; Aukus fight in Labor ranks; Indigenous Vietnam veterans identified","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

Full Story Australia’s love affair with football – is this a new beginning? Australia has fallen in love with the Matildas. Despite bowing out in the World Cup semi-finals to England, football fever has spread across the nation and sparked hope that this tournament is just the beginning of a bright future for women’s sport. Gabrielle Jackson speaks to Mike Ticher and Mike Hytner about how Australia must capitalise on the Matildas’ World Cup success. In-depth The Coalition appears to have landed on a neat solution to decarbonising Australia’s electricity grid – just swap out the coal plants for nuclear. The shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, says such a plan would reduce the need to spend billions on connecting solar and windfarms to the grid. But what O’Brien has failed to mention is the cost of a new plant to build – and that the pace at which you could deploy the small modular reactors he advocates means sitting on our hands until at least the end of the decade. Not the news The Sitter by Angela O’Keeffe is a compelling and playful novel narrated from beyond the grave by Marie-Hortense Fiquet Cézanne, wife and frequent subject of the French painter. It is, in many ways, a book about looking and being looked at, about depiction and all that it might mean. That its opening scene places the reader somewhere ambiguous and slippery, simultaneously within and external to what is being observed, is a skilful gambit – and one that resonates across the rest of the novel.

In his book Falling Upwards, Richard Holmes adduces the drawing as evidence of the intimate relationship between balloons and military competition, with, for instance, the first French company of aeronauts formed on the remarkably early date of 29 March 1794. Today we might contemplate another point Holmes makes: “Balloons are also ancient and symbolic devices [with] a long history, and a longer mythology, going back in various forms and dimensions thousands of years, to ancient civilisations in South America and China.” Perhaps that long symbolic resonance explains something about the otherwise baffling battle of balloons raging in our 21st century skies. US defence personnel now say they have downed four mysterious objects floating across America and Canada over the last week. A spokesperson for the state department blamed China for flying balloons over “more than 40 countries across five continents”; China’s foreign ministry countered by claiming to to have detected 10 US balloons in its airspace since January 2022. The US and China both control hundreds of spy satellites. These high-tech surveillance systems suck up communications data at whim, generate images so precise as to reveal details of clothing, cracks in the pavement and rubbish on the ground, and classify information in real time using the latest iterations of AI. Once launched, they’re almost impossible to circumvent – and so, for the most part, both sides respond to constant orbital scrutiny by pretending (at least publicly) that it doesn’t exist. Why, then, the sudden concern about a technology developed in the 18th century? In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers launched a balloon emblazoned with the cipher of Louis XVI, carrying skyward a sheep, duck and a cockerel (all three later hailed as “heroes of the air”) before a huge crowd at the Palace of Versailles. The display might not have saved Louis from the guillotine a few years later but it established a relationship between lighter-than-air flight and state power, reinforced when Napoleon celebrated his coronation by sending aloft a silk-draped balloon carrying a huge imperial crown on golden chains. Yet shortly after the Montgolfier demonstration, Prof Jacques Charles and the brothers Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis Robert launched the first hydrogen balloon in central Paris. It landed in the village of Gonesse – where the peasants destroyed it with pitchforks. If balloons could awe the masses, they could also, it seemed, enrage them. On 18 December 1856 Sydney newspapers advertised that a certain Pierre Maigre, “of aerial fame in France, US, East Indies, Mauritius and other places”, intended to “climb to the heavens” in what would be Australia’s first balloon flight. But when Maigre attempted to inflate his craft before a huge crowd of paying spectators on the Domain, the slowness of the process so bored the onlookers that, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, some “four thousand boys and youths, with yells and hootings, [went] flying after the unfortunate aeronaut, who, however, succeeded in making his escape, not exactly in so trim a guise as that in which he had appeared in public”. The crowd then began chanting, “The balloon! The balloon! Burn the balloon,” a task they soon accomplished. The Domain balloon riot (a “scene of wanton mischief such as we never wish to behold again”, the SMH said), delayed the first successful Australian flight until February 1858, when George Coppin engaged Joseph Dean and Charles Henry Brown to launch a balloon in Cremorne in Melbourne. Only two weeks later, when Brown attempted a second flight, he reported how when he descended “on the road between Collingwood stockade and Brunswick”, he was “treated in the most brutal manner by the people ascended … they tore the hair from my head, bruised, pushed and almost suffocated me, besides damaging the balloon by tugging at trampling on it”. In 1864 the famed aeronaut Henry Coxwell received even rougher treatment in Leicester, England, when rumours spread among the 50,000 spectators watching his ascent that he was palming them off with an older, smaller balloon. The crowd turned on Coxwell and, when he abandoned the flight, attacked him, chanting, according to one newspaper, “Rip him up,” “Knock him on the head” and “Finish him.” Once again the balloon was burnt, with its remains paraded triumphantly through the town. The hostility sometimes shown to Victorian aeronauts clearly stemmed from the class polarisations of the era. But the balloons themselves made tempting targets for popular wrath because of the way they combined the sublime and the profane. They soared high above ordinary men and women and yet could be so easily reduced to their flimsy, prosaic components. Perhaps there’s something similar in the current crisis. The most important spy technology remains, by its nature, almost entirely invisible. Yet, unlike a satellite, the first balloon shot down by the Americans could be seen by the naked eye – and as such provided a public, palpable focus for the tensions between the US and China. Once it became visible, escalation seemed inevitable. Holmes says ballooning enables “the most enduring early dream of flying”, which he describes as fundamentally metaphysical. “The ultimate purpose is,” he says, “to fly as high as possible, and then look back upon the earth and see mankind for what it really is.” In that spirit, what does the balloon crisis reveal? Fairly obviously, it shows that polarisation between the superpowers has reached such a level of tension that confrontations could break out over issues that no one saw coming. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T17:00:56Z","webTitle":"The Rev Alan Powers obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/the-rev-alan-powers-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My brother, Alan Powers, who has died aged 81, was a Methodist minister who worked around England and in parts of the US. He was a socialist radical thinker and, although also recognising his duty to his congregations, in the 198os in Dover he walked and picketed with striking miners. Born and brought up on a council estate in Acocks Green in Birmingham, Alan was the sixth of 10 children of Frank, a bricklayer, and Beatrice (nee Edgington). He attended Severne Road nursery, infant and junior schools and Pitmaston boys’ school before gaining a place at Bordesley Green technical school in the city in 1954. He was a keen football fan – an Aston Villa supporter – and played in goal for the Bordesley Green school team, winning the league and the cup in the south Birmingham schools fixtures. On leaving school in 1957 he trained as a structural engineer in Birmingham. His interests, however, were set on church ministry with the Methodist foundation, and in 1962 he was awarded a scholarship to Richmond Theological College, University of London, where he gained a diploma in theology in 1966. In the same year he married Sheila Meredith, also from Birmingham – they went on to have two sons, Paul (known as Kingsley) and Conrad. Together, Alan and Sheila boarded the SS Groote Beer in Rotterdam, sailing to New York then travelling on to the Christian theological seminary in Indianapolis, where Alan gained his master’s degree in 1967. Before he returned to Britain he took the opportunity to use Greyhound bus services to see more of the US, and especially to visit the grave in Taos, New Mexico, of his favourite author, DH Lawrence. Alan’s ministry began in Redcar in North Yorkshire in 1967, followed by a posting to Brixton, London in 1970. In Meanwood, Leeds, he took a doctorate in ministry between 1974 and 1982. He then worked in Dover (1982-85), County Durham (1986-94) and Manchester (1994-97). His final posting was to Stockton on Tees, from 1998 to 2005. He retired to Northallerton in Yorkshire that year. In 2020, Alan and Sheila moved to Darlington to live with Conrad. He is survived by Sheila, Kingsley and Conrad, and six of his siblings. • This article was amended on 17 November 2022, to add details of further surviving family members."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T17:07:36Z","webTitle":"Sudan: which powers are vying for influence in vast east African country?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","fields":{"bodyText":"The conflict in Sudan is an internal power struggle, with its roots in the country’s troubled politics over recent decades. Four days of fighting has pitted army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional governing sovereign council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council. Their power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict. At the same time, a dozen or more regional powers, major actors in the Middle East and geo-political heavyweights have a stake in the fighting raging in Khartoum and elsewhere. The United States, which is the biggest actor, is able to exert influence directly on key individuals, through the withholding or delivery of huge sums of aid, its weight in international forums such as the United Nations or multilateral lenders, and its ability to build coalitions of smaller powers. The US wants stability in a restive region of enormous strategic importance, and also to roll back the growing influence of competitors such as China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. Washington welcomed the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has been criticised for taking too soft a line with the two main military powerbrokers and particularly with Burhan. China has been making a major effort to win friends in east Africa through the construction of major infrastructure, economic investment, loans and support for incumbent rulers who are attracted to its brand of authoritarianism. But although China has ambitions to establish a role as a mediator of consequence across the continent, it is unlikely to have much influence on this conflict. This relative neutrality at least offers Beijing a potential opportunity to build a relationship with any eventual victor. In contrast, Russia is seen as being fully committed to Hemedti and the RSF. The former warlord has been linked to Russian efforts to extract huge amounts of gold from Sudan to help fund the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has deployed Wagner group paramilitaries to bolster Hemedti’s operations. Beyond the precious resources, it is Sudan’s strategic position that has attracted Moscow, particularly the chance to position a major naval base there, which would allow operations in the Indian Ocean. Egypt has longstanding ties with Sudan’s military and has made its support for Burhan clear. Egyptian soldiers – or “trainers” – have been taken captive by the RSF in recent days. Cairo wants stability and likes the idea of an authoritarian military man in charge of its vast neighbour. But it also wants the support of Khartoum in its bitter argument with Ethiopia over the control of the flow of the Nile. The Egyptians also want to check the influence of their regional rivals in Sudan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also major actors, and their rulers have personal relationships with many of the key figures in Sudan. Both have poured huge sums of money into Sudan since 2019 in an attempt to build a regime favourable to their interests. Hemedti won favour by dispatching thousands of Sudanese fighters to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition there, but Burhan has been welcomed too. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become much more aligned with western policy in Sudan in recent years. In recent weeks, Riyadh in particular has been active in trying to avert conflict – though without much success, it appears. The European Union is aligned with the US and the United Kingdom in seeking a compromise agreement that would lead to a transition to civilian control. Chaos in Sudan could trigger a new increase in refugees, and France is particularly concerned about the consequences for fragile states farther west where it has already lost much influence in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/25/back-and-ready-chris-minns-leads-labor-to-power-after-12-years-in-opposition-at-historic-2023-nsw-election","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-25T12:07:22Z","webTitle":"‘Back and ready’: Chris Minns leads Labor to power after 12 years in opposition at historic 2023 NSW election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/25/back-and-ready-chris-minns-leads-labor-to-power-after-12-years-in-opposition-at-historic-2023-nsw-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/25/back-and-ready-chris-minns-leads-labor-to-power-after-12-years-in-opposition-at-historic-2023-nsw-election","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor is on track to form majority government in New South Wales after 12 years in opposition, with the party leader, 43-year-old former firefighter and political staffer Chris Minns, declaring the party is “back and ready to govern in this great state”. As counting ended on Saturday night, Labor had picked up at least nine seats, enough to govern in majority and a better-than-expected result for the party after big swings in many previously safe Coalition seats. The result means Minns will become the first Labor leader to win government from opposition in NSW for almost three decades and sees the Coalition relegated to the opposition benches in every parliament on mainland Australia. The election had been fought by Labor on a few key issues including a promise to end the sale of public assets, removing the controversial public sector wages cap and for investments in health and education. In a late-night speech delivered to a packed room of party faithful in a function room in the beachside suburb of Brighton-Le-Sands, in Minns’ seat of Kogarah in Sydney’s south, he said the election was “a decisive vote against privatisation”. “We know the challenges are huge, the responsibilities are awesome but NSW Labor is back and ready to govern in this great state of NSW,” he said. “We started effectively two years ago with a promise to the people of NSW that we would run an election campaign asking people to vote a positive vote for NSW Labor and not just a negative vote against the government. “I’m proud to say today the people of NSW voted for the removal of the unfair wages cap. They voted for our nurses, our teachers … our paramedics and police.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For the Coalition, the result marks a devastating blow. Dominic Perrottet had sought to reset the government after becoming premier in late 2021 after former premier Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation, and won plaudits for his push to reform poker machines in the state. But the baggage of 12 years in government proved too much to overcome. Speaking on Saturday night, former Liberal prime minister John Howard paid tribute to Perrottet for running an “heroic” campaign. “He put forward ideas. He was bold,” Howard said, saying the outgoing premier’s stance on problem gambling – something he called a “social evil” – was “admirable”. In his concession speech, Perrottet announced he would stand down as the state’s Liberal party leader while hailing the three-term Coalition government’s record. “It is a time to reflect. It is a time to rethink and ultimately to renew. To renew as leader of the parliamentary Liberal party, I take full responsibility for the loss this evening,” he said. “But we as a party, we as a government should be very proud of what we have achieved together. “Make no mistake, we’ve made history of being in government for the longest time since our party was formed. And our government has achieved so much in so many ways. We’ve kept NSW strong, free and fair.” In their speeches, both leaders paid tribute to one another for a campaign which had largely avoided going negative. Perrottet said he believed Minns would make a “fine 47th premier … because I believe that he will lead with the same decency and the same integrity that he has led with so far,” he said. Labor had been keen to play the expectation management game earlier on Saturday, pointing out that despite polls favouring the party it had a narrow path to victory. It needed nine seats to form a majority, with only four on margins of less than 5%. It had not held Goulburn – held on 3.1% – since 1965, and by the end of counting on Saturday night it remained too close to call. But it didn’t matter. Labor gains in regional seats of South Coast and Monaro – both seats previously held by the Coalition on safe margins – as well as in Sydney’s west in Parramatta, Riverstone, Penrith, East Hills, Ryde and Camden – meant it was in a position to form government. Labor also remained in the hunt for the seat of Balmain, held by the Greens since 2011. The Liberal party also lost Wakehurst and Berejiklian’s former seat of Willoughby to independents Michael Regan and Larissa Penn. It is only the third time Labor has won government from opposition in NSW – most recently in 1995, when Bob Carr won with a one-seat margin. Labor’s path to victory relied on a narrow message focused on the Coalition’s record on privatisation, scrapping its controversial public sector wages cap and promises to lift spending on health and education infrastructure. But the party was criticised for refusing to back Perrottet’s push on gambling reform, instead offering only a trial of the mandatory cashless gaming systems on 500 poker machines across the state. Their victory will mark a blow for anti-gambling advocates, who had hailed Perrottet’s push on the issue as a generational reform in the pokies capital of Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-23T23:31:17Z","webTitle":"Solar and windfarm investment is drying up – and Australia needs a wake-up call on the future of the electricity grid | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"This week should be a wake-up call on the future of the electricity grid, but we seem in danger of collectively drawing the wrong conclusions about which way to go. The main problem is straightforward – investment in large-scale solar and windfarms has dried up to next-to-nothing just as it is supposed to be moving into overdrive. According to a report by the Clean Energy Council on Wednesday, in the three months to the end of June investors made financial commitments on only four renewable energy projects. And these projects are not particularly big, adding up to just 348 megawatts of new capacity – a fraction of one coal power plant. This is not a one-off. The first three months of the year were even worse. It’s the slowest start to a year since the council started recording this data in 2017. This has obvious ramifications, including putting targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction in doubt, if not out of reach. It also increases the risk of the electricity grid failing unless decisive steps are taken to address the slump. At the moment, there is little sign that is happening. If anything, the focus is in the opposite direction. In New South Wales, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported that a “reality check” commissioned by the Minns Labor government advised it to negotiate with the owner of Eraring, Australia’s largest coal plant, to extend its life beyond its planned closure date in two years. By any measure, this is a ridiculous situation for the state to find itself in. Eraring is 40 years old, ready for decommissioning, and it is expected it will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars to prop it up a little longer. A broadly similar scenario is playing out in Victoria. In 2021, the Andrews government made a deal to keep the Yallourn brown coal generator open until 2028. This week it announced an agreement to ensure another plant, Loy Yang A, remains available until mid-2035. These deals will cost taxpayers an undisclosed, but presumably substantial, sum. There is an argument that these decisions are now unavoidable. We obviously can’t shut coal plants before replacement generation is ready, and it’s possible some generators should be kept on the books to be switched on only if needed. In Victoria’s case, it’s at least tied to a goal of 95% renewable energy – and, therefore, no coal – by 2035. But it’s notable how much political and media discussion is focused on the risks of moving past coal, and not the solutions that can speed up an inevitable transformation needed to address the climate crisis. The idea that renewable energy is not up to doing the job persists no matter what the evidence says, or how often it’s presented. No one is building new coal power plants in Australia, and most recent problems in the grid were caused by outages at old coal units, not solar or windfarms. The risk of that repeating grows the longer they run. As challenging as the rollout is, we have the technology to replace them more rapidly. The move to clean energy is faltering due to governments and public agencies, not because the machinery can’t do the job. The biggest government failure has been well documented. For nearly a decade, the federal Coalition tried to slow or block the shift away from fossil fuels, and made any serious climate policy political poison. It deserves much of the blame for the disorderly transition happening now. But there are other deeply ingrained problems. They include the idea that the market will drive the shift to a renewables-dominated system just because solar and wind energy generation is cheaper than fossil fuels. Labor came to power attached to this thinking. It was backed by a report by the consultants RepuTex that suggested the country would reach 82% renewable energy by 2030 if the government offered $20bn in low-cost finance for the private sector to build electricity transmission lines. We now have evidence that this isn’t going to be enough. The scale of what’s being attempted is massive – a near complete rebuild of the power grid. Just as the existing grid was mostly built and managed by governments before being privatised, the rebuild will need clearer direction from the top to succeed. The only credible option that can rapidly cut emissions is a system that runs on solar and wind plus back-up – batteries, inter-regional transmission, pumped hydro and, initially at least, some fast-start gas plants. Despite what the Coalition and its backers claim, there is plenty of evidence this mix can provide what is needed, and there are no available or affordable alternatives. The Albanese government and most states have started down the renewables-plus-firming path to varying degrees, but it’s a messy picture. What’s missing is a policy that acknowledges that the energy transition is a race – to meet science-based climate targets and ensure there is enough new generation to replace coal plants ASAP, but also to win an increasingly competitive battle for global clean industry investment. Last year’s US Inflation Reduction Act kicked that into overdrive. What’s needed, badly, is something that drags large-scale renewable energy into the system faster. Options could include a revamped renewable energy target, an expanded safeguard mechanism that effectively puts a carbon price on coal energy, and a front-loaded underwriting program. It would need to run alongside a plan to streamline the construction of transmissions links, including an evolving assessment of where they should and shouldn’t be built, factoring in cost blowouts and local concerns. A more concerted effort to improve energy efficiency to cut how much grid electricity we use and limit power bill increases wouldn’t hurt, either. The climate and economic benefits would be significant. They could include avoiding having to spend wads of cash propping up a dying, polluting industry – a step that, presumably, everyone can get behind. • Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-27T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"bodyText":"Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-15T20:45:37Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Putin meets Xi, asylum seeker handcuffs ‘torture’, nuclear sub timeline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning – Vladimir Putin has hinted at tensions between Russia and China over Ukraine. There’s a near-8km queue of Queen mourners (or are they?) in London – but in Australia, the Country Women’s Association is thinking of dropping the monarchy, and God, from its motto. The United Nations’ torture prevention watchdog has been urged to investigate Australia’s use of handcuffs on asylum seekers when seeking medical care – a practice advocates condemn as inhumane and unlawful. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac) has requested the UN’s subcommittee on the prevention of torture investigate the practice during its visit next month – it is expected to scrutinise Australia’s immigration detention network. Vladimir Putin has publicly referred to China’s “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine, in a rare nod to tensions between the two states caused by the Russian invasion.

Rolfe was found not guilty of murder and two alternative charges after a six-week trial in the supreme court in Darwin earlier this year. On the first full day of Queen Elizabeth II’s lying in state, a huge queue formed in London – approaching its 8km limit (though as one crowd behaviour expert points out, not everyone there may be in mourning). The Queen will rest finally at her favourite home, Windsor Castle, but first King Charles III and his siblings will stand vigil over her coffin on Friday night, and on Monday the country will grind to a halt for her state funeral.

The result means the left and right blocs are now neck and neck as MPs prepare for a vote in congress that will determine who gets to govern. The left’s hopes of remaining in power now rest even more firmly on Junts, the centre-right Catalan pro-independence party led by Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan regional president who fled Spain to avoid arrest over his role in the failed unilateral bid for independence almost six years ago. Although the rightwing People’s party (PP) won the snap election, it fell well short of expectations and only narrowly beat the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), led by the acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Faced with another hung parliament, the PSOE had appeared to be the major party most likely to be able to cobble together the parliamentary numbers to win an investiture vote. But the overseas vote, which was counted and factored into the overall result on Saturday, means the right and the left bloc now each have 171 seats in the 350-seat congress. Should the small Canarian Coalition party ditch its stated aversion to supporting any PP government that includes the far-right Vox party, the right bloc’s seat count could rise to 172. Both blocs are now exploring their options as congress prepares to convene on 17 August. King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs’ backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority of 176 of the 350 seats in Spain’s lower house. If the candidate falls short of the 176 seats – as is likely to be the case – a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority – more votes for than against – will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year. The new arithmetic means that the abstention of Junts will no longer be enough to see the PSOE and its partners in the new Sumar alliance into power through the second-round simple majority vote. Instead, Sánchez will need at least one Junts MP to vote for his coalition government. Junts has made it abundantly clear that its support will come at a price. It has already called for an amnesty for those still facing charges over the secessionist push, such as Puigdemont, and for a binding referendum on Catalan independence. The PSOE has made it plain that neither option is on the table and that any negotiations will be carried out in accordance with the constitution. Puigdemont appears to be biding his time and has said failure to reach agreement with his party could lead to another vote at the end of the year. “If, six days ago, the provisional result had already placed us at the centre of conversation and speculation, with the final results at hand the position has become even starker: either Junts votes yes or the PSOE ends up facilitating the investiture of [the PP leader Alberto Núñez] Feijóo … or we go to the repeat of the elections,” Puigdemont wrote in a long tweet on Saturday. “Not enough time has passed to know what the two big Spanish parties will end up doing.” Sánchez has already insisted that another election will not be necessary, saying he was “sure that our democracy can find a formula for government”. He has ruled out doing anything to facilitate a PP-led government. The PP, which has repeatedly attacked Sánchez for what it sees as his cynical reliance on Basque and Catalan independence parties, has now said it is willing to talk to Junts “within the terms of the constitution”. But the PP’s potential coalition partners in Vox are unlikely to be in favour of any such negotiations. The far-right party, whose rise was largely fuelled by the Catalan independence crisis, said it would take a firm line on regional independence should it enter government, adding it had “no doubt” that tensions in Catalonia would rise once more with the PP and Vox in power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T15:30:35Z","webTitle":"Bank of England denies QE caused double-digit inflation; mortgage arrears and repossessions jump – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time for a recap…. The Bank of England has rejected claims that its QE bond-buying programme is to blame for inflation soaring over 10%. In a session with the Treasury Committee, policymakers explained to MPs that it was the supply chain problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and then the surge in food and energy prices after the Ukraine invasion, that drove inflation to its highest in decades. The BoE also pushed back against criticism that the unwinding of QE, called quantitative tightening or QT, could be destabilising markets. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden liked QT to ‘descending a mountain’, rather than decommissioning a nuclear sub, arguing that the Bank wanted to be able to climb future peaks by doing more QE if necessary. There are also signs today that higher interest rates are hitting the housing market. The number of homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year. That included a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance said. In other news: Take note, younger readers. Children’s income in the UK has risen by 11% in the last year, ahead of inflation and rather faster than average wages. The figures on children’s pocket money and earnings – part of what was claimed to be the most in-depth study of the UK’s “youth economy” – also found that six-year-olds had enjoyed the biggest “pay rise”, in the form of a 34% annual increase. Meanwhile, average earnings from babysitting leapt 24% in a year to top £20, while some savvy children were able to prise cash out of their parents for “jobs” such as making someone a coffee or smiling for a family photo. The data was based on the finances of more than 125,000 children and was collected from user activity on the NatWest Rooster Money pocket money app and prepaid debit card. Whether it was down to parents deciding to shield their children’s finances from the worst of the cost of living crisis, or an improvement in youngsters’ ability to negotiate a better financial deal and monetise small tasks, the study – based on data collected between 1 March 2022 and 28 February this year – suggested that British kids have fared a lot better financially than many adults.

Around 20% of shares were cast against chairman Michael Roney being reelected, at today’s AGM. Advisory group PIRC had recommended investors should vote against Roney, because he also chairs Grafton Group, the builders merchants. PIRC argued: “It is considered that a chair cannot effectively represent two corporate cultures. “The possibility of having to commit additional time to the role in times of crisis is ever present. There was also a protest against Next’s pay policies, with 16% opposing the remuneration report. The age of huge UK property price increases may be coming to an end, according to a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility. David Miles, one of three members of the UK budget watchdog’s top committee, argues that slowing population growth slows and higher interest rates will weigh on house prices. Miles told a speech at an Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence conference in London that: “Those forces driving them up are going to be much weaker, I suspect, in the next 40 years than they have been in the past 40 years. “If anything, this unusual age of massive rises of house prices may be nearing an end.” The boss of Burberry has complained that the UK is at a “competitive disadvantage for global shoppers” which has held back sales in its home market after the government ditched a VAT tax break for tourists. Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive of the luxury British brand best known for its signature check and raincoats, said sales to tourists had risen 19% in London in the three months to April but they had tripled in Paris and were up 43% in Milan. He said total sales had risen 28% in the UK for the year as locals and visitors from Europe from the US, Asia and the Middle East spent more, but he noted a big surge in UK tourists spending in Europe, “which is quite telling”. Akeroyd said: “We are disappointed the government chose to scrap the VAT retail export scheme. It leaves the UK at a competitive disadvantage for global shoppers. We are celebrating the fact that we are a British luxury brand and very hopeful that when tourists come to the UK they are coming to Burberry. We are really hoping this [tax change] can be revisited.” More here: This echoes a similar warning from the chairman of Burberry last month: The pound has sagged to its lowest level since late April today, down three-quarters of a cent at $1.241. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says the markets seem ‘unmoved’ by BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s warning yesterday about a ‘wage-price spiral’ gripping the UK. We heard from some Bank of England policymakers earlier as they were grilled by the Treasury Select Committee on quantitative tightening, among other things naturally. Bailey and colleagues were quite consistent in their messaging and it’s probably what the Governor said on Wednesday that raised a few eyebrows as he insinuated that the UK could be seeing a wage-price spiral which could complicate returning inflation to 2%. The members were still confident in their assessment despite repeated reminders of apparent past failures and markets seem unconcerned about the supposed wage-price spiral, continuing to price in one, maybe two, hikes this year. Things should become much clearer very soon. The increase in the number of households falling into early arrears on their mortgages “should not be a cause for panic”, says Sonia Fernandes, principal, mortgages at UK Finance. Writing in a blog on UK Finance’s website, Fernandes explains: “Lenders are proactively supporting borrowers who are worried about their finances. “Over the last year, lenders have helped nearly 200,000 borrowers who cannot meet their full mortgage payment by providing tailored forbearance.” Fernandes adds that borrowers can seek help as soon as they needed it: “Tailored forbearance means that a lender will offer support focused on the borrower’s individual circumstances and what they can afford to pay. “Examples of the support available includes a period of reduced payments, a period of zero payments or a temporary switch to interest-only. Importantly borrowers will never be asked to pay more than they can afford. “There is no need for a borrower to wait until they have missed a payment to seek help. Over the last year, lenders proactively supported two million borrowers with financial difficulty assistance, including budgeting support, access to debt advice and breathing space.” Over in the US, the number of new claims for jobless support has fallen. There were 242,000 ‘initial claims’ filed across the US last week, a drop of 22,000, suggesting America’s labour market is holding up relatively well. The fall comes after fraudulent claims in at least one state boosted the numbers in previous weeks, Bloomberg reports, adding: On an unadjusted basis, claims decreased by the most in two months, to 215,810, largely due to a drop in Massachusetts. Some economists have been wary about drawing strong conclusions from the data amid reports that fraudulent claims have been behind the recent upward trend in filings. Over in Tokyo, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has announced what sounds like a hefty jump in Japanese investment into the UK. Japanese businesses have commited “almost £18 billion investment in the UK”, the government says, in a handily timed announcement as Sunak hosts a business reception in Tokyo. Much of this planned investment will be in green energy, but some will only arrive over the next decade. Japanese trading house Marubeni is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with the UK, which envisages approximately £10bn of investment in the UK with its partners over the next 10 years. This will include offshore wind projects in Scotland and green hydrogen projects in Wales and Scotland. There’s also £4bn from Sumitomo Corporation, to expand offshore wind projects off the coasts of Suffolk and Norfolk. Political leaders do like to coral such deals together into a nice round number to mark such visits or events. Earlier this week, France hailed €13bn worth of future investments pledged by international companies at its Choose France event. Today, Sunak says: These new investments are a massive vote of confidence in the UK’s dynamic economy, from some of Japan’s top firms. The UK certainly needs a boost of spending. Business investment is still 1.4% below its pre-pandemic levels, last week’s GDP report showed. However, today’s announcement does not include new investment from Japan’s car industry, at a time when the UK auto sector is gripped by concerns over Brexit trade rules. Sunak, who is in Japan for the G7 meeting of world leaders, was asked about calls to delay new rules of origin regulations, to help the British car industry. Speaking to broadcasters on board the JS Izumo aircraft carrier in the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, he said: “It’s something that car manufacturers across Europe, not just in the UK, have raised as a concern. “We are engaged in a dialog with the EU about how we might address those concerns when it comes to auto manufacturing more generally.” The investment flow between Japan and the UK isn’t just one way, though. UK company Octopus Energy is to invest £1.5bn in the Asia-Pacific energy market by 2027, to speed up the shift to “a cleaner, smarter energy system”. The jump in people in arrears with their mortgage, or being reposessed, shows that rising borrowing costs and rampant inflation are battering household budgets. Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, explains: “The golden era of low mortgage rates has come to an end following a rapid rise in interest rates to combat red hot and sticky inflation. Almost two million mortgage holders on tracker rates have felt the brunt of each of the 12 consecutive base rate hikes as they came. Meanwhile, the uptick in mortgage rates is a kick in the teeth for mortgage holders who have come off a fixed rate deal in recent history. “There could unfortunately be a new wave of borrowers falling behind on repayments in the near future, as there are around 700,000 borrowers with fixed rate mortgages - the majority of which were set at interest rates below 2% - maturing in the second half of the year alone. However, the current low level of unemployment could slow the rise in mortgage arrears and repossessions. “The fact that buy-to-let mortgages in arrears are increasing at a faster rate than residential mortgages shows that landlords have not been immune to the cost-of-living squeeze on budgets, Jobson points out: Recent research by the ONS revealed that tenants are 4.4 times as likely to be experiencing financial hardship compared to homeowners. Missed or delayed rent payments could leave many smaller landlords in a financially precarious position. This cohort may have also seen their profit margins recede dramatically after coming off a fixed rate mortgage because of heightened mortgage costs. “Those struggling to keep up with mortgage repayments should contact their lender as their first port of call to explore their options and support available. It is worth consulting a debt advice charity such as StepChange or Turn2Us and they will go through all of your options.” Sky News is reporting that the online party goods supplier founded by the Princess of Wales’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, has been sold after it failed to avoid collapsing into administration. Party Pieces Holdings, launched by the Middletons in 1987, was bought on Thursday by James Sinclair, an entrepreneur, Sky says. They add: Sources said the sale had been implemented through a pre-pack administration, meaning it had appointed insolvency practitioners before being sold without some of its liabilities. It was unclear what price Mr Sinclair’s company, Teddy Tastic Bear Co Ltd, had paid or how big the liabilities were that had been left behind. Across the economy, company insolvencies in England and Wales fell by 15% in April, after rising to a three-year high in March, with companies high by higher interest rates and rising costs. The number of UK homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year, according to figures from a trade association. There was a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance has reported today. Some 750 homeowner mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023. UK Finance said the increase in repossessions is from a very low base, as cases make their way through the courts. More households fell behind with their mortgage payments too: there were 76,630 homeowner mortgages in arrears of at least 2.5% of their outstanding balance in the first quarter of 2023, 2% more than in the previous quarter. The data also shows a rise in buy-to-let mortgages have fallen into arrears, as landlords are hit by rising interest rates rise. There were 7,030 buy-to-let mortgages where landlords were in arrears by 2.5% or more of the outstanding balance at the end of March, UK Finance reports, an increase of 16% compared to the previous quarter. Also, 410 buy-to-let mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023, 28 per cent greater than in the previous quarter. Away from the Bank of England, EasyJet’s chief executive Johan Lundgren said rival airlines were setting fares “way out of proportion”. Lundgren argues that demand means his own carrier could be set for record summer profits, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham reports. Speaking after announcing narrowing winter losses this morning (see earlier post), Lundgren said analyst consensus suggested that easyJet would have its best ever summer financially. He said: “While it’s still early on, we’ve only sold 36% of the Q4 capacity, it’s very encouraging.” Air fares will be significantly higher this year, delighting some airline accountants, but Lundgren said easyJet would still be “providing exceptional value.” He said that the average easyJet fare for in the summer months was still £75, adding: “There are a number of legacy and full-service airlines completely pricing themselves way out of any proportion, which is giving up the opportunity to really demonstrate the value proposition that we have”. He cited research that showed 45% of people now said they were more likely to fly with a low-cost airline than before the pandemic. He said the airline had been operating well despite French air traffic strikes, with capacity already not far off summer peak, but after last year’s cancellations and disruption due to staffing issues, ““We are absolutely not complacent.” EasyJet is opening a base at Birmingham, its first new UK base in a decade, and said it will have a million more seats overall on UK flights this summer than in 2019. All these metaphors (comparing QT to climbing down a mountain) and explanations about the future direction of QE/QT are confusing everyone and blur the Bank’s message (again), warns Professor Costas Milas of University of Liverpool’s management school. He tells us that the facts are as follows: The MPC’s revised forecasts for higher inflation and output underestimate (in my view) the strength of monetary tightening already in place. Divisia money has contracted to a historically low of -3.2% in 2023Q1. This should imply lower inflation and lower GDP growth than currently predicted by the MPC (as I discuss in my co-authored European Journal of Finance paper:) Nevertheless, there is an alternative (but not very flattering) explanation. Current monetary tightening could be less effective than previously thought because the MPC (sadly) lacks credibility (as evidenced by household expectations of inflation that are consistently higher than those of the MPC). In other words, the MPC will be forced to tighten much more than what it has done in the past in order to hit the 2% inflation target… UK benchmark borrowing costs have hit the highest level since the aftermath of the mini-budget. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK gilts has risen to 3.915% today, the highest since last October. That follows the suggestion from the Bank of England this morning that its quantitative easing programme could be higher next year than in 2023, implying more sales of bonds back to the market. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The Bank of England then denies that its quantitative easing programme has fuelled a surge in asset price inflation. Governor Andew Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that real asset prices have not surged under QE in the way that is often reported. Real equity prices certainly haven’t, Bailey says. Actually, the period in which the house price to income ratio rose most was the period of 10 years before 2007. That was the period when it rose most substantially. It haven’t done the same thing since then. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden then tells MPs that investors think Britain has a bigger inflation problem than the United States. That, he tells the Treasury Committee, explains why British government bond yields have risen by more than their US counterparts. Asked why the spread between interest rates on UK gilts and German bunds, and US Treasury bills, has widened, Ramsden explains: “My take on this is that there is more of a concern about persistence of inflation (in Britain) and therefore an expectation that our short-term (interest) rate - set by us - will be higher. That feeds through into yields.” Ramsden also told the Treasury Committee that expectations of US monetary policy have also changed, with the markets starting to anticipate possible cuts by the US Federal Reserve due to problems in the US banking sector. Ramsden also reminds Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom that high UK borrowing is amother important factor influencing bond yields. The UK’s debt management office is issuing £243bn of debt this year, up from £125bn, he says, due to the fiscal interventions following the pandemic. Thirdly, Ramsden suggests that the chaos following last September’s mini-budget is still a factor, given the turmoil in the liability driven investment (LDI) pension market caused by the jump in bond yields. He says: The third factor which may explain some of those yield differentials is that there may be a bit of a risk premium, or liquidity premium, following on from the LDI episode. It may be that some of the pension funds and the like have not come back as fully into the market or they’re still adjusting, so you don’t have the same demand for some of those longer term gilts as you had in the past. That means that the price of them may be lower than it might otherwise be, so the yield is higher. Q: If monetary policy acts with a lag, as you argue, why is the Bank continuing to raise interest rates when inflation is expected to fall? That’s a question we spend hours discussing, Ben Broadbent smiles, and there’s a “range of views”. The issue is how long the ‘second-round effects’ of inflation, on wages and prices, lingers, as an interest rise today will have little impact by the end of 2023. These rate increases are “causing more pain to people out there”, says John Baron MP (who had just been arguing that rates should have been raised faster). Broadbent explains that the Bank’s forecasts are conditional on the markets’ interest rate forecasts. So if rates were cut further, inflation would be higher…. Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank shares Baron’s concerns that inflation could be stickier than hoped, which is one reason it raised interest rates again this month, to 4.5%. The committee will return to this issue at another session next week. John Baron MP shoots back that central banks, such as the Bank of England, were behind the curve in waking up to rising inflation. Had the Bank been more proactive, there might be less pain for people today, Baron suggests. Q: A month before Ukraine, inflation was on a sharp trajectory higher at 6%, interest rates were 0.5%. Wasn’t that a woeful neglect of duty? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent point out that interest rates were low for a decade without causing a rise in inflation. There’s a distinction between causing an inflation shock, and being slow to respond to one, Broadbent insists, pointing to the enormous economic shocks from the pandemic and the Ukraine war. He explains to the committee how the pandemic led to a shift in demand for goods, globally, pushing up prices. The key question was how long that would last for – the Bank’s MPC judged that if this demand, and disruption, was caused by the pandemic, then the end of the pandemic would bring it down. That wasn’t a terrible judgement, Broadbent insists, pointing out that the price of computer chips and lumber has dropped as expected. However, the China lockdown did last longer than expected. Broadbent explains: You always have to look forward and ask yourself, how long will this continue? Baron isn’t convinced, saying it was “quite evident” that inflation, even before Ukraine, would not fall away significantly. Broadbent disputes it, citing consensus forecasts at the time were that inflation would come down. “Ah, consensus forecasts…”, says Baron dismissively. Broadbent point out that these 30 forecasts are from people who spend their lifetime doing this work. Back at Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England is rejecting claims that its quantitative easing bond-buying programme is responsible for the UK’s cost of living crisis. Conservative MP John Baron asks the BoE top brass about the link between QE and the UK’s bout of double-digit inflation. Q: You announced a large expansion of QE in 2020. Was it simply a coincidence that inflation rose from 0.3% in 2020 when you launched your final tranche of QE to over 5% by the end of 2021? Governor Andrew Bailey points out that the UK economy has been hit by several shocks, including the Covid-19 supply chain shock and the Ukraine war. They both drove up inflation, and aren’t to do with QE or QT. Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that the UK has not seen a strong recovery in demand since the pandemic, which indicates that QE is not the cause of inflation. Baron points out that UK inflation was running at 6% before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so “we were already on a steep trajectory”. Bailey agrees, but says the Bank was weighing up whether the inflationary shock from Covid-19 would be transitory, or not. If the only shock that the world had experienced was that one [the Covid-19 supply chain disruption] then I think the evidence now suggests it had a limited time period. Unfortunately, of course, Ukraine came along, and there was no gap between these shocks. As such, Bailey says we can’t use the word “transitory” to describe these shocks. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent points out that the UK had 10 years of QE without an inflation problem, or strong money growth, as did other regions such as the US and the eurozone [he outlined this in a detailed speech last month]. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden tells MPs that the Bank launched more QE after the pandemic began, because it feared the economy would suffer ‘permanent scarring’. Ramsden voted to end QE early, in September 2021, as he grew more concerned about inflationary risks. But stopping QE early would have been a surprise, potentially jolting markets. And cutting QE early, by £30bn, might have taken just 0.2 or 0.3 percentage points off Uk inflation. Ben Broadbent suggests that market data indicates that the QE conducted in June and November 2021 may have added half a percentage point to UK inflation. The idea that this is the cause of double-digit [inflation] is not well-supported. Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to suspend the livestream of its AGM in Glasgow twice within the first 10 minutes, after climate protesters interrupted chairman Robin Budenberg’s opening remarks. It’s quite hard to hear what the protesters are saying, since they haven’t been given microphones and Lloyds keeps cutting out the feed, but it’s clear that they’re hitting out at the bank’s contribution to the climate crisis, through certain financial services. Budenberg has urged them to wait until the Q&amp;A segment, but to no avail, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Climate protesters have also staged a demonstration outside of the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow, alongside staff union Unite - which is separately concerned about the company’s decision to force staff to spend at least two days a week in-office. Anyone working compressed hours will also have to negotiate new working patterns with managers. Unite has previously said the move will do “immediate and tangible damage” to work-life balance and family budgets. Q: We’ve been told that quantitative tightening is similar to decommissioning a nuclear submarine, so it has to be done extremely carefully because the potential for things to go wrong is enormous…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent agrees that there are risks, but the Bank has taken them into account. It’s important to avoid selling bonds into illiquid markets, and to conduct QT in a very predictable, very gradual way, he explains. He tells the Treasury committee that the start of QT was delayed after the crisis in the LDI pensions market last autumn, for this reason. Broadbent says: It’s not the case that on the days we’ve sold these gilts there’s been any sort of disruption, and of course we watch for those things very closely. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden weighs in too, disputing the ‘nuclear submarine decommissioning’ angle. He tells the MPs that the bank still wants QE to be a monetary policy tool in future. Ramsden reminds the committee that he worked in the Treasury back in 2009, when then-governor Sir Mervyn King got in touch to say the Bank wanted to start quantitative easing. It was always seen that QE would not go on for ever, there would always be some QT, he explains. He compares the bond-buying programme to mountaineering, saying the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility has grown to a size where the Bank reached “the top of the mountain” (the APF was £895bn at its peak, but is now shrinking under QT). Ramsden says: You have to be careful going back down the other side. Because you want to be in a position that you can climb another mountain afterwards, if you have to. So you always have to be very careful on the descent. A lot of accidents happen on the descent of mountains, Ramsden points out. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin shoots back out that you also run the risk of starting an avalanche…. Q: Is the Bank of England certain that QT is not having any impact on the market? We’ve had a bank failure since you started… Is it having any inflationary or disinflationary pressures? Governor Andrew Bailey says he doesn’t see any connection between quantitative tightening and the events in the banking sector. As proof, he points out that the UK banking system has not experienced stress in recent months – the failure of Silicon Valley UK bank was a “very idiosyncratic issue”, because it was the subsidiary of a bank that failed in the US. Bailey then explains that UK banks hold £1.5 trillion of “high quality liquid assets”, of which £900bn is reserves at the Bank of England. The BoE’s QT programme should reduce those reserves, with banks looking to hold other high quality liquid assets instead. But that rebalancing should be “entirely manageable and entirely natural”, he pledges…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent reiterates that QT is already priced into the financial markets, and those asset price levels are used in the Bank’s economic forecasts. Broadbent says the Bank can’t tell exactly what impact QT is having, because it has already announced it (so it’s priced in…). But the Bank’s best bet is that it is having a fairly modest impact, maybe just 0.1 percentage point on inflation. Q: How might the size of the Bank’s QT programme change in future years? Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden says the Bank won’t definitely plump for another £80bn reduction in its bond holdings next year. That’s because it would mean lower ‘active sales’ of bonds, given that more of the Bank’s stock of gilts expires next year. Ramsden says bank analysis will determine the pace of QT: So there’s the potential for us to go up a little bit. I don’t see us going down, given the experience of the first year. Q: Why did the Bank set a target of selling £80bn of its stock of government bonds in the first year of QT? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says there has to be a number (!), before explaining that ‘active sales of £10bn’ a quarter, on top of the £10bn of bonds which naturally mature each quarter, felt about right. He reveals that the Bank’s market experts warned that anything over £100bn might disturb market liquidity. The important point, Broadbent explains, is that the markets have a number for QT which is ‘priced in’ to bond prices (and thus the yields, or interest rate, on those bonds). On the days of the Bank’s QT auctions, there’s been no detectible moves in bond prices, he insists. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden denies that the Bank of England is “flying blind” with its QT programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin replies that the Bank is flying ‘slowly’, and reminds the Bank that the launch of QT was disrupted last autumn (due to the market chaos created by the mini-budget). Q: You announced the flight take-off, and then almost immediately had to land the plane when you started… Governor (captain?) Andrew Bailey points out that the Bank hasn’t actually begun – so it delayed the takeoff of QT, rather than returning to the runway. Bailey insists it was correct not to launch quantitative tightening operations in disturbed market conditions last autumn (the Bank waited until the start of November). And he denies that the Bank contributed to the disturbed markets, with its plan to sell some of its QT bonds back to investors. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey tells MPs that he does not believe the Bank’s balance sheet will return to its levels before the financial crisis, even once it has conducted its quantitative tightening (QT) programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin asks Bailey why the BoE decided last September to embark on QT – the process of cutting its holdings of government bonds bought since the 2008 crisis. [Reminder: the BoE had bought almost £900bn of UK gilts, in one programme launched after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and a second after the pandemic]. Bailey explains that the Bank wants to adjust its balance sheet so that it has headroom to do whatever it might need to do in the future. It does not want its balance sheet to simply get larger after every economic shock. But, the governor insists he does not “envisage” the BoE’s balance sheet returning to where it was before the financial crisis. The key reason is that QE has created a stock of cash reserves owned by commercial banks which sits on the liability side of the BoE’s balance sheet. There is “no question” that the banks will need to hold larger cash reserves to ensure prudential stability, and the UK is not alone in this, Bailey explains. Parliament’s Treasury Committee are starting a hearing with senior Bank of England officials now, at the Bank. MPs will grill BoE governor Andrew Bailey, and deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. The committee says Continuing its inquiry into quantitative tightening, the cross-party Committee of MPs will examine the impact of tightening on the economy, the role of quantitative easing in the outbreak of double-digit inflation, and whether tightening will bring inflation down. The government’s levelling-up agenda has taken a knock, with new growth figures showing that London was the fastest-growing part of the English economy last summer. London’s GDP grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2022, the ONS reports, making it the region with the largest positive quarter-on-quarter growth in Q3. The largest negative growth in England was in the East Midlands, where GDP shrank by 1.6%. Overall, the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in July-September. Wales’s economy struggled, with GDP falling by 2% in the quarter, while Scotland contracted by 0.3%. Growth in England and Northern Ireland was flat. North East England’s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q3 2022, with the South West expanding by 0.4%. All other English regions shrank. Inflationary pressures may be easing, according to the latest realtime data from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS found that 18% of trading businesses expect to raise the prices of goods or services they sell in June, down from 23% for May. More than a third (35%) of trading businesses reported an increase in the prices of goods or services bought in April compared with March; down from 38% when comparing March with February. Ovo Energy and Good Energy have been ordered to pay £4m after overcharging thousands of households on their gas and electricity bills by breaching the government’s energy price cap. The affected households will receive a combined total of £2.7m from the two companies while an extra £1.25m will go to vulnerable customers in the UK under Ofgem’s voluntary redress fund. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, found that Ovo overcharged almost 11,000 customers by nearly £1.5m, or an average of £181 for each household, by failing to apply the government’s energy price guarantee which sets a maximum rate for every unit of energy used between last October and March. Good Energy overcharged just under 7,000 households a total of £391,650, or about £109 on their energy bills. The suppliers will repay the amounts to their customers, and have been ordered to make extra compensation payments for the “totally unacceptable” breach to the Ofgem fund. Good Energy will pay £1.25m to the redress fund “for the inadequate systems, processes and repeated inaccurate reporting of information” over an extended period, the regulator said. More here: Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has secured a £234m investment from China’s automotive manufacture Geely, sending its shares soaring this morning. Geely is buying 42m shares from chairman Lawrence Stroll’s Yew Tree Consortium at 335p each, and will subscribe to buy another 28m at the same price. This will give Geely a 17% stake, making it the company’s third-largest shareholder behind Yew Tree (with 21%) and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (with 18%). Aston Martin says Geely’s investment is part of a “new relationship agreement” to suport its growth plan. Stroll says: “This announcement is a further significant step towards delivering our ambition for Aston Martin. Geely Holding, who initially became a shareholder last year, sees tremendous potential for Aston Martin’s long-term growth and success. They offer us a deep understanding of the key strategic growth market that China represents, as well as the opportunity to access their range of technologies and components. Geely share our vision for Aston Martin and want to be a more significant shareholder. Aston Martin’s shares have jumped 12% in early trading, the top FTSE 250 riser, to 260p. Geely’s investment comes at an important time for the car industry, as pressure mounts to reform the Brexit trade deal, points out interactive investor’s head of investment Victoria Scholar: Aston Martin is a glamorous automaker with a chequered past having survived several bankruptcies. But James Bond’s favourite carmaker has revved back into the fast lane with a pick-up in sentiment spearheading investor returns on the stock. Demand for luxury goods including cars has proven to be extremely resilient amid the cost-of-living crisis and a growing tranche of ultra-high net worth consumers. Earlier this month Aston Martin reported a narrower pre-tax loss in the first quarter of £74m versus £112m year-on-year. This investment is a welcome developed at a time when there are growing concerns about the Brexit trade deal for UK auto manufacturing. Stellantis this week sounded the alarm over potential tariffs on exports to the EU. UK auto manufacturing has come under significant pressure since the referendum with annual car manufacturing more than halving between 2016 and 2022.” Untreated sewage pollution of rivers should have been managed sooner, the water industry chair said as she apologised for industry failures. Water UK chair Ruth Kelly told Times Radio that companies did not monitor sewage outflows until recently, with only 10% overseen in 2015. Speaking after the water industry apologised for its failings, and announced a £10bn infrastructure plan, Kelly said: “We should have acted quicker. We should have acted faster. We should have acted to prevent the untreated water sewage going into our rivers and onto our beaches. “We have listened, we get it and we have come today with a plan to put this right.” Asked whether the average executive pay of £1.1m per year could be justified, Kelly poined out that 50% of CEOs would forgo bonuses entirely. She said: “Shareholders have decided they wanted to pay for some of the brightest and best people to lead the water company industry.” Kelly also told BBC Breakfast that the UK public will face “modest upward pressure” on water bills for up to a century to pay for the clean up of sewage from rivers. Musician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey has said the water companies’ apology and sewers modernisation plan was “nothing to celebrate” as he said customers were left having to “pay them a second time” to clean up the country’s rivers. The former Undertones frontman told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What I’m actually hearing is no apology for the fact we’ve paid them for a service we haven’t got. “They are now suggesting that we should pay them a second time for a service we haven’t had. BT’s job cuts also show the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy. CEO Philip Jansen says BT will use AI to improve customer service. Jansen also said the job cut target announced this morning was the culmination of an existing programme, which includes 30,000 contractors employed to build its fibre network in the next few years. He told reporters: “It’s a rolling programme, but it’s a five to seven year landing zone.” Many of BT’s planned job cuts will fall on its UK workforce. CEO Philip Jansen told a call this morning that ‘a big chunk’ will be in the UK, on the ‘build side’ of the company Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: “BT is planning to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030 as it looks to slim down its operations and reduce its cost base. ‘A big chunk of job cuts will be in the UK’, said BT’s CEO Philip Jansen. It is targeting £3bn in cost savings by 2025. Full-year core earnings rose by 5% to £7.9 billion, in line with analysts’ expectations but BT reported disappointing free cashflow down 5% to £1.3 billion and pre-tax profits slumped 12% to £1.7 billion. Telecoms seems to be awash with job cuts at the moment with Vodafone and BT both reducing the size of their workforces. Both have been struggling with the pressures of inflation, most notably from energy. BT is focusing on digitisation and integrating AI, a shift which is likely to require fewer workers. Last year the telecoms operator was caught up in a bitter dispute with workers over wages amid the cost-of-living crisis, resulting in BT’s first national strike for 35 years. Shares in BT have fallen sharply today by over 7% and are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100, but the stock remains higher by just below 20% year-to-date.” Elsewhere this morning, easyJet has shrunk its losses as customers look to ‘safeguard’ their holidays in the cost of living squeeze. EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £415m for the six months to the end of March, an improvement on the £557m loss a year earlier. It carried 33.1 million passengers over the six months between October and March, a 41% increase on the 23.4m a year earlier. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline enters the summer period “with confidence”. Lundgren explains: Recent research has shown that travel is the number one priority for household discretionary spend with customers safeguarding their holidays and increasingly opting for low cost airlines and brands which provide great value. “easyJet holidays expects to deliver full year profits of more than £80 million as it continues its rapid growth in the UK alongside its entry into the European package holiday market. From summer it will start selling holidays in Switzerland which will be the first of a number of planned new European markets. Shares in easyJet are largely unmoved, though – up just 0.15% this morning at 521p. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, says today’s update hasn’t provided the magic to drive easyJet’s shares higher. The tone is upbeat, but now investors will want to see the airline delivering on these rosy assumptions. Given still-high inflation, some scepticism probably isn’t entirely unwarranted. In the energy sector, National Grid has reported a jump in annual profits to almost £4.6bn. The surge in earnings comes amid growing concern that it is not connecting renewable energy projects fast enough to meet the UK’s climate targets, my colleague Jillian Ambrose reports. The FTSE 100 monopoly said its underlying operating profits climbed by 15% to £4.58bn for the financial year ending in March compared with the 12 months before. This was driven by a surge in profits from its electricity distribution business which climbed by 39% from the previous year to £1.2bn for the year to the end of March. National Grid is under pressure from developers to overhaul its approach to connecting new renewable energy projects to the grid as it emerged that many will be forced to wait more than a decade for a connection. The UK plans to run its grid entirely on clean electricity by 2035 but many renewable energy projects have been told they will need to wait until the late 2030s to provide clean power to the grid. The National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, said: “there has never been a more exciting time to be at the heart of the energy industry”. BT has seen Vodafone’s job losses earlier this week and “taken them to another level” this morning, says Matthew Dorset, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot:. Dorset adds: “The business has faced pressure from alternative network providers, although on the retail side customer numbers have remained stable. On the Openreach side of the business BT had a net loss of 68,000 connections, a reversal of a recent trend of slowing losses. This will be a concern and a figure to watch going forward. Dorset adds, though, that BT has benefited from its price rises being linked to inflation, which led to hefty increases. “Crucially, BT has been able to maintain a competitive position in the market due to prices being inflation linked. Given competitors do the same there is no real threat of customer churn there and it should be supportive for earnings. Finally, as interest rates have risen at an extraordinary pace, the debt burden facing alternative providers will be good news for BT. While it is a business in transformation, it has a good mix of short and long-term opportunities to take advantage of.” The market isn’t very impressed with BT either. Shares in the company dropped up to 10% in early trading, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. As well as announcing up to 55,000 job cuts, BT also reported a 1% drop in revenue for the year to 31st March. Reported profit before tax fell 12% to £1.7bn, which BT blamed on “increased depreciation from network build and specific items, partially offset by adjusted EBITDA growth”. BT shares fell as low as 133.2p, from 148.1p last night, the lowest since early February. Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company are among biggest early fallers on the London Stock market, after its results this morning. International Distribution Services have dropped by 4.5% on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after being pulled into a £748m full-year loss by Royal Mail’s woes. Unions are alarmed by BT’s plans to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030. John Ferrett, national secretary of Prospect (which represents thousands of managers at BT) says workers will be very unsettled by the announcement. “Prospect are deeply concerned by the scale of these cuts. Announcing such a huge reduction in this way will be very unsettling for workers who did so much to keep the country connected during the pandemic. “As a union we want to see the details behind this announcement in order to understand how it will impact upon members and have demanded an urgent meeting with the Chief Executive. It’s important that job cuts are voluntary, Ferrett adds: “We have always opposed compulsory redundancies in BT and has been able to ensure over the years that any reductions have been achieved on a voluntary basis. “Prospect has a partnership agreement with BT which governs how the company and the union manage change in the organisation. “We will be ensuring that the partnership agreement is fully adhered to during any consultations with BT over job reductions.” BT’s jobs cuts announcement comes just two days after Vodafone announced it would cut 11,000 positions worldwide, the largest reduction in its history. UK telco BT is planning to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030, as it pushes to become a ‘leaner business’. BT Group, the UK’s largest broadband and mobile provider, has declared it will reduce its workforce by tens of thousands of jobs by the end of the decade. BT says it will cut its “total labour resource” (it’s own workforce, and those employed by third parties) from 130,000 today to between 75,000 and 90,000 by the 2030 financial year. Chief executive Philip Jansen says BT will rely on a much smaller workforce, reducing its cust base, once it has completing the rollout of its new fibre broadband network. Jansen says: “By continuing to build and connect like fury, digitise the way we work and simplify our structure, by the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller workforce and a significantly reduced cost base. New BT Group will be a leaner business with a brighter future.” Jansen also says BT’s Openreach operation, which maintains its network, is competing strongly, and “it’s clear that customers love full fibre”. The Openreach Board has reaffirmed its target to reach 25 million premises with FTTP [Ultrafast Full Fibre broadband] by the end of 2026 and plans to further accelerate take-up on the network Despite reporting a £1bn loss this morning, Keith Williams, the chair of Royal Mail, argues there are reasons to be optimistic. Williams says Royal Mail is sorry that it hasn’t delivered a better service, and insists that the universal service obligation must be reformed. Williams tells the City: “I said before that we had reached a crossroads at Royal Mail. Now that we have a negotiators agreement with CWU that will shortly go out to ballot, and thanks to the good progress made on our five-point plan to stabilise Royal Mail, our destination is coming into sight.” “There is now a clear path towards a more competitive and profitable Royal Mail, delivering improved services for our customers whilst further reducing our environmental impact. Importantly, if ratified, the CWU agreement provides greater job security and increased rewards - through both pay and profit share - for our employees. Successful delivery of the agreement will be key.” “Quality of service has been significantly affected by industrial action and high levels of absence. I am sorry that we have not delivered the high standards of service our customers expect. Improving quality of service is our top priority.” “GLS has a proven track record of growth, solid margins and cash generation. During 2022-23 it delivered a robust performance in a tough macro-economic climate. Its flexible operating model, balanced B2C and B2B portfolio, diversified geographic exposure and continued investment have underpinned good progress this year and we continue to invest for long-term growth and margin accretion.” “So as we enter 2023-24 we have grounds for optimism. The economic climate remains challenging, and Royal Mail faces the task of rebuilding business from the damage caused by industrial action. To do this successfully and plan for the long term, urgent reform of the Universal Service Obligation is essential. Our plan is to return to group profitability this year but also seize the opportunity for both businesses to deliver ongoing profits thereafter, to the benefit of both our employees, customers and shareholders.” Royal Mail has reported a loss of over one billion pounds, after a year hit by strikes and poor delivery performance. Parent company International Distributions Services has reported that Royal Mail made a loss of £1.044bn in the year to March, down from a profit of £250m a year earlier. IDS says Royal Mail was hit by industrial action, with workers holding a string of strikes in the last year in a bitter dispute over pay and conditions. IDS blames Royal Mail’s inability to deliver “the in-year benefits of planned productivity improvements”. Weaker online shopping, and a drop in volumes of Covid-19 kits, also hit Royal Mail’s earnings compared with a year ago. IDS warns that the UK’s Universal Service Obligation (USO) – which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to every address in the land if necessary – “requires major reform”. It tells shareholders this morning: We urge the Government to work with us to protect the long-term sustainability of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service. Earlier this week, communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation into poor performance at Royal Mail that could lead to a fine. after more than a quarter of first-class mail was not delivered on time. Earlier this year, a cyber attack forced Royal Mail to temporarily suspend international parcel and letter deliveries through Post Office branches for several weeks. The company’s international parcels business, GLS, made an operating profit of £296m, down 9.5%, today’s financial results show. But overall, IDS has made a loss of £748m, down from a £577m profit the year earlier. Last week, Royal Mail’s CEO Simon Thompson quit, after the acrimonious tussle with unions, but will stay on until the end of October. On an adjusted basis, Royal Mail made an operating loss of £419m, beating market expectations according to Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. European carmakers have joined the push to delay post-Brexit rules on where parts are sourced from, amid fears that the future of the British automotive industry is at stake. As we covered yesterday, Vauxhaul owner Stellantis, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover all called on the UK government to renegotiate the Brexit deal, to change “rules of origin” terms. Currently, electric vehicles shipped between the UK and the EU will incur a 10% tariff unless at least 40% of their parts are sourced from within the two regions. That proportion is due to rise to 45% next year, which is a problem for electric carmakers as most electric vehicle batteries are still imported from Asia. The European trade group for the car industry is calling for a delay extension to this phase-in of tougher post-Brexit trade rules. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warns that supply chains, particularly electric vehicle batteries, are not ready. An ACEA spokesperson expained: “There has been massive investment in European battery supply chains. “The capacity to meet these rules of origin will come, but just not in the next few years. ACEA has requested that the current phase-in period for battery rules is extended by three years.” VDA, the German car industry lobby group, has weighed in in support, the Financial Times reports today. VDA said “we must urgently make adjustments” to the agreement, as Europe’s battery industry had not developed fast enough. Otherwise, they fear that tariffs would place… “a significant competitive disadvantage for the European car industry in relation to its Asian competitors in the so important UK market”. Also coming up today Water companies have apologised for repeated sewage spills and pledged to invest £10bn this decade in an attempt to quell public anger over pollution in seas and rivers. The companies will triple their existing investment plans to plough funds into the biggest modernisation of sewers “since the Victorian era” to reduce spills of overflowing sewage into England’s waterways. Industry body Water UK said the plans will cut the number of overflow incidents by up to 140,000 each year by 2030, compared with 2020. But the costs will ultimately be recouped from customers through higher bills, adding to the cost of living pressures in coming years. MPs are heading to the Bank of England to grill the central bank’s top brass this morning. The Treasury Committee plan to quiz governor Andrew Bailey on the Boe’s government bond-buying stimulus scheme (quantitative easing, or QE) and its role pushing up inflation, and how it will be unwound (quantitative tightening, or QT). Yesterday, Bailey pledged to lift interest rates as far “as necessary” to get inflation back to the bank’s 2% target. European stock markets are set to open higher, on hopes that the US debt ceiling deadlock will be broken, avoiding a US default. Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said on Wednesday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach.

The Pacific country is waiting for its president to recall parliament so lawmakers can vote for a new prime minister after a national election showed no party received a clear majority. A coalition of three parties say they have a combined majority and have agreed on the People’s Alliance leader, Sitiveni Rabuka, as prime minister. Fiji First and the incumbent prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, have not conceded defeat. Both men have led coups in the past. Opposition parties have disputed reports – cited by police and Bainimarama as reason to bring in the military – that businesses or homes of Fiji’s large ethnic Indian population have been targeted or stoned in the wake of the election. The opposition groups have called for evidence of this. At a media conference on Thursday, the National Federation party leader, Biman Prasad, said Fiji First’s secretary general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who was the attorney general in Bainimarama’s government, was “trying to create fear in the minds of people” and should accept the election result. “He is not accepting they lost this election, people voted for change,” Prasad said. The police commissioner, Sitiveni Qiliho, said a decision had been made to call in the military after he met with Bainimarama as well as the minister for defence and policing, Inia Seruiratu, and the military commander, Maj Gen Jone Kalouniwai. “We came to an agreement for RFMF personnel to assist police with the maintenance of law and order, amidst growing concerns of racial tension,” a statement published on Thursday read. Qiliho said the decision was based on reports received that “minority groups continue to be targeted and information of planned civil unrest received”. The police commissioner also cited “threats made against minority groups who are now living in fear following recent political developments”. “While the army and navy personnel have been called in to assist, police will continue to lead the overall security operations,” he added. Bainimarama issued a statement saying the military had been deployed to complement the police in maintaining law and order. “The reports of harassment suffered by our citizens and violence targeted at Indo-Fijian homes and businesses in the wake of the election are deeply disturbing,” he said in a Facebook post. Fiji’s president, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, has until 2 January to summon parliament, media outlet Fiji Village reported, citing a letter sent by Katonivere to the coalition partners. The prime minister must be voted in by more than 50% of lawmakers on the parliament floor. Bainimarama and Rabuka were initially deadlocked after the election. Rabuka’s People’s Alliance Party won 21 seats and the affiliated National Federation Party won five seats, while Bainimarama’s Fiji First party secured 26 seats. That left Sodelpa, which won three seats, holding the balance of power. The party decided on Tuesday in a close 16-14 internal vote to go with Rabuka – a vote that Fiji First is now questioning. The Pacific island country, with a population of 900,000, had a history of military coups before constitutional reform in 2013 to remove a race-based voting system that favoured indigenous Fijians over ethnic Indians. In 2006, Bainimarama instigated a coup and was installed as prime minister the year after, before leading Fiji First to majority government at the 2014 and 2018 democratic elections. Rabuka is a former prime minister who instigated a coup in 1987 before bringing back democratic elections in 1992 and led the country through to 1999. The Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), a power-broker holding three seats in the hung parliament, supports policies favouring indigenous Fijians, and on Tuesday signed a coalition agreement with Rabuka’s People’s Alliance and the National Federation Party. However Sodelpa’s board must meet again, after the validity of the decision to back the coalition was challenged by the party’s general secretary and Fiji’s supervisor of elections. Sayed-Khaiyum, from the governing Fiji First party, lashed out at Rabuka, accusing him of sowing division in Fiji. “The entire rationale of this man has been to divide Fiji to gain political supremacy,” Sayed-Khaiyum said. “And we can see that simmering through again. In fact it’s not simmering, it’s boiling.” A day earlier, Rabuka and two other party leaders announced they were forming a coalition with a total of 29 seats against Fiji First’s 26 and would form the next government. “A government we hope that will bring the change that people had been calling out for over the last few years,” Rabuka said at a news conference. “It’s going to be an onerous task. It will not be easy, and it was never easy to try and dislodge an incumbent government. We have done that, collectively.” Rabuka’s announcement had prompted the New Zealand foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, to send her congratulations on Twitter, saying New Zealand “looks forward to working together to continue strengthening our warm relationship”. But the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, took a more cautious approach, saying she was waiting until the dust settled.

What cavern of loneliness took a woman who ruled her world into the arms of Wagga Wagga wide boy Daryl Maguire? The Hay Plains grifter. A man whose nearly 20-year political career saw him never considered for a ministry or even the wastelands of a shadow ministerial role. The relentless eye of Icac unearthed phone taps in which Maguire insisted: “Even when you are the Premier, I am the boss, all right?” “Yes,” she said repeatedly. “I know.” The anti-corruption commission introduced the phone tape evidence to argue the former premier was indeed in thrall to this hillbilly huckster, sufficiently to set aside her public responsibilities to please him. “I impress a lot of people,” says Maguire on the tape. “Why aren’t you impressed in front of people? You should be.” The secret relationship lasted five years until it was upended by the commission’s investigation. “I’ll throw money at Wagga,” Berejiklian told Maguire during one taped conversation. “I’m batting for you.” Her eagerness to please him shines on the tapes. “I’ve already got you the Wagga hospital,” she assures him. “I just spoke to Dom [Perrottet] and I just said put the 140 in the budget and he goes ‘no worries’. He just does what I ask him to, so it’s fine.” NSW bureaucrats had not supported a $5.5m pitch for an Australian Clay Target Association facility in Maguire’s electorate. Without disclosing her “close, personal relationship” with Maguire, Berejiklian worked to overturn that decision, putting her “in a position of conflict of interest between her public duty and her private interest”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Similarly, a $10m grant to the Riverina Conservatorium of Music “breached public trust” because Berejiklian was “influenced by the existence of a close personal relationship with Mr Maguire, or by a desire on her part to maintain or advance that relationship”. Criminal? No. The Icac expressly notes that it will not be sending a brief of evidence against the former premier to the director of public prosecutions. The relevant criminal charge would be “misconduct in public office”. Icac’s “corrupt conduct” finding does not automatically trigger a criminal process. That makes it difficult for Berejiklian to overturn the finding. The report, she says, “is currently being examined by my legal team”. The commission’s many critics say the report’s long gestation, and the designation of “corrupt” despite there being no prospect of a criminal conviction, deprive Berejiklian and others of natural justice. It’s different for Maguire, who faces new potential charges to add to those he’s fighting over an alleged cash-for-visas scheme. Two of his business associates have also been recommended for charges. The report found Maguire sought to exploit his position to “enrich himself” for years before his relationship with Berejiklian began. It allegedly continued while they were together. Berejiklian’s failure to report “reasonable suspicions” about Maguire’s alleged corruption itself constituted “grave misconduct”, said Icac. During the Icac hearing, Berejiklian defended her impulse to pour money into Wagga Wagga. “I don’t think it would be a surprise to anybody that we throw money at seats to keep them.” Her fundamental line remains unchanged. “At all times I have worked my hardest in the public interest. Nothing in this report demonstrates otherwise,” says her statement. The Liberal shadow attorney general, Alister Henskens, stressed “there is no finding of any pecuniary benefit” to the former premier. A brief statement from Optus gives no suggestion her executive career there is in any danger. Her public standing is reduced rather than destroyed. Berejiklian says the public’s “incredible support … will sustain me always”. Villain? Victim? Corrupt or crucified? Her saga demonstrates that corruption commissions are powerful things. And that in politics even more than normal life, you need to pick your partners well.

The Oxford English Dictionary added 26 Korean words. The K-pop band BTS has topped charts internationally and met Joe Biden at the White House this summer. After sweeping through Asia years ago, hallyu – the “Korean wave” of culture – has crashed upon western shores too, as documented in a new exhibition at the V&amp;A in London. This is a serious business. A recent book, Shrimp to Whale, plays on an old saying portraying Korea as a tiny creature surrounded by leviathans and captures its triumphant postwar ascent from abject poverty and trauma. South Korea still regards itself as a middle power. But in economics, technology and especially culture it is now a powerhouse. One government source jokes that soft power – a country’s ability to get what it wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment – is the South’s nuclear weapon. Joseph Nye, who coined the term soft power in the late 1980s, has suggested that it depends on a nation’s culture, political values and foreign policies. Building it is not as straightforward as amassing the bombs and tanks required for hard power. China has invested heavily in soft-power initiatives, but has yet to produce a Blackpink or Snowpiercer. Its determination to micromanage cultural projects hampers the ability to appeal to foreign audiences. (Prof Nye has suggested that its influence will remain limited for as long as it “fans the flames of nationalism and holds tight the reins of party control”). In contrast, democratic South Korea has pursued an arm’s-length approach, modelled partly on UK initiatives such as the British Council. Squid Game and the Oscar-winning Parasite hardly shed a flattering light on the nation that produced them: they have triumphed by capturing the monstrous cruelties and inequality of modern capitalism there, in a way that has resonated more widely. The strategy is a recognition that soft power belongs to nations, not governments. The origins of South Korea’s status as a cultural behemoth are complex. But if the state can take some credit, civil society should take more. There was outrage in 2016 when it emerged that then-president Park Geun-hye’s administration had blacklisted thousands of artists and entertainers – a reversion to the kind of censorship and punishment once seen under authoritarian leaders, including Ms Park’s father. It is the people who have nurtured, promoted and defended media and artistic independence. Globally, this is an era in which diplomatic platitudes have been stripped away, and force laid bare once more. Nationalist strongmen are in charge around the world. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was the ultimate assertion of hard power. Yet the video addresses by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has so consummately inhabited the role of war leader; the sharing of daily life by citizens; even the defiant humour of postage stamps have all helped to bolster public support for Ukraine in other countries. In doing so, they have helped to maintain the political will to keep supplying it with heavy weaponry in the face of Russian menace. Soft power is hard to define and harder to master. But it counts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T01:29:33Z","webTitle":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said Russia may plan to decouple the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from the Ukrainian power grid, backing up warnings from Ukraine’s own nuclear power firm. Macron spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday and said the call was necessary because of the urgent nuclear threat to Europe. Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents. “The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said. Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown. Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato. The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement. Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity. On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said. Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war. “Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter. Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm. The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems. The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter. “The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.” Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”. “The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.” He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said. “They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.

When Rishi Sunak flies east this week to attend the G20 summit in New Delhi, he will be glad to put more than 4,000 miles between himself and the cost of living crunch, public services that are falling over and grisly opinion poll ratings. His international peer group will treat him with more courtesy than do many of his own MPs. Performing on what is loosely called “the world stage” will be a salve to the prime minister’s self-esteem. What else it will achieve is moot. There is little expectation that this G20 will come to much, not least because of the divisions between its western and non-western members about the war in Ukraine. It is being reported that Xi Jinping won’t even turn up, scotching earlier talk from Number 10 of a bilateral between Mr Sunak and China’s leader. The world will become “more insecure and more unstable” over the next decade, cautioned Ben Wallace in the valedictory letter he wrote to the prime minister to accompany his departure as defence secretary. We may hope he’s wrong, but a prudently robust foreign and security policy needs to be designed to address the peril that this warning will turn out to be accurate. The known risks include some highly scary ones, among them a wilting of western resolve to support Ukraine’s struggle for freedom, Donald Trump returning to the White House consumed by a lust to take revenge on his opponents domestic and foreign, and a Chinese lunge at Taiwan. This asks a question to which we currently have answers that are, at best, muddled: what precisely is the UK’s foreign and security policy? Inconsistent is the politest description of the approach to the world pursued over 13 years of Conservative government. Under David Cameron, “follow the money” was the motto. Most of the emphasis was placed on drumming up business for Britain, and the diplomatic corps were told to regard themselves as a sales force for UK plc. It was epitomised by rolling out acres of red carpet for Russian oligarchs, which doesn’t look awfully clever now, and the declaration of a “golden era” in relations with China, another concept which has aged extremely badly. During the time of Boris Johnson and the brief interregnum of Liz Truss, foreign policy was driven by the Brexiters’ delusions that a happy-go-lucky Britain would be free to go it alone in the world and do as it pleased. That notion has been smashed by contact with geopolitical reality. The swaggering braggadocio about “Global Britain” has been quietly consigned to oblivion by Mr Sunak. Both the soft power and the hard power of the UK have been diminished on the Tories’ watch. Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, has confessed that we are no longer a “development superpower” because of savage cuts to the aid budget. The global reach of the BBC’s World Service is declining amid reductions in its output and staff. The revolving chaos at Number 10, which saw three prime ministers in one year, had our ambassadors trying to persuade the world that the UK was not turning into a banana republic with lousy weather. While Mr Sunak is regarded as a more reliable performer on the world stage than his immediate predecessors, he suffers from the widespread expectation that he will be booted off the cast list within a year or so. The perception that his days in power are numbered gives international interlocutors less incentive to want to develop relationships with him. His allies respond that the prime minister has demonstrated he can put himself and Britain at the heart of major global debates by convening an international summit on the safety of artificial intelligence. It will meet at Bletchley Park, the Buckinghamshire home of Second World War code breakers, in November. Number 10 would like this summit to be regarded as a singular coup, with the potential to position Britain at the centre of efforts to regulate AI. That yearning rather betrays their anxieties about Mr Sunak being treated as a lame-duck prime minister abroad as well as at home. The UK was an early mover in support for Ukraine and has made substantial contributions of arms and munitions, but the effort has underscored frailties in our hard power. Britain is running out of kit that meets the needs of the Ukrainians. The British army is shrinking to its smallest size since the end of the Napoleonic wars. Mr Wallace’s parting shot was that a muscular military should be treated not as an optional extra but as an absolute imperative: “We must not return to the days where defence was viewed as a discretionary spend by government and savings were achieved by hollowing out.” The appointment of Grant Shapps as the new defence secretary, his fifth cabinet post in 12 months, has angered some Conservative MPs and caused consternation among military figures because he has no expertise in the area. His loyalty to Mr Sunak and pedigree as a political attack-dog are the main reasons Mr Shapps landed the role. To some I have talked to, this appointment exposes the prime minister as a man who is not fundamentally serious about defence and security, even at a time of the largest war in Europe since 1945. His friends depict Mr Sunak as a realist and a pragmatist who sees foreign policy through the prisms of problem-solving and relationship management. Number 10 is unapologetic about issuing an invitation to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, to visit Downing Street this autumn. James Cleverly’s recent trip to Beijing, the first by a British foreign secretary in five years, was defended on the grounds that the UK has to “engage” with big powers, even those with grotesque records on human rights and menacing global ambitions. That inflamed the divide about China within the Conservative party. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith was among those to accuse his own government of “appeasement” of Beijing. A withering report by the foreign affairs select committee complained that the UK government’s China strategy is so highly classified that details have not been shared with some relevant ministers and officials. It occurs to me that things may be even worse than the committee thinks. It could be that the China policy is being kept so secret because the government doesn’t actually have a plan with enough coherence to deserve to be called a strategy. Mr Sunak is keen on closer ties with India. The economic growth of India is pacey, it has overtaken China to become the world’s most populous country and it is gaining geopolitical clout. Indian ambitions were highlighted by landing a spacecraft near the south pole of the moon and there are many familial links with the UK. Yet there are also considerable tensions in that relationship and at several levels. India has been strategically ambivalent on the war in Ukraine while massively increasing its purchases of Russian oil since Vladimir Putin ordered his brutal invasion. Cleaving closely to Washington has for decades been the lodestar of British defence and foreign policy, but there’s a growing view within Whitehall that the US can no longer be regarded as an all-weather ally. Relations with Joe Biden’s White House are cool and the UK needs to be thinking about how it would handle a return to the Oval Office by Mr Trump. Just because that seems insane, it doesn’t mean it is entirelyinconceivable. As a cash-strapped, midsized power in a dangerously unpredictable and unstable world, the UK needs to be smart at making and keeping friends, especially with other liberal democracies with similar values. Which brings us to our nearest neighbours. Relations with EU countries have become less poisonous since Mr Sunak moved into Number 10. There’s been some recovery from the depths of distrust towards the UK which were plumbed under Boris Johnson. The main product has been the Windsor agreement, which resolved a two-year stand-off about the rules governing trade between the mainland UK and Northern Ireland. Yet there’s still a distinct frost.

Speaking in the shadow of several vast grain silos in the key trading port of Odesa, Samantha Power pledged a further $250m to create and expand alternative routes for Ukrainian grain to leave the country, but admitted nothing would compensate for the loss of the Black Sea ports. Her visit came after Russia carried out a series of missile and drone strikes on southern and eastern Ukraine overnight. Most of the missiles were shot down but falling debris damaged some infrastructure in Odesa port. Russia had vowed to retaliate after a blast on a bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula on Monday. Moscow accused Ukraine of attacking the Kerch Bridge, used to transport military supplies to Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014. “In recent weeks Russia began blocking ships from entering this port, and yesterday Putin made the reckless and dangerous decision to end Russian participation in the Black Sea grain initiative,” Power said. “Putin decided to cut off a vital lifeline to the rest of the world, and overnight and this morning Russian forces fired drones and cruise missiles not far from where we are standing right now.” She said Putin’s justification for pulling out of the agreement was full of “falsehood and lies” and the decision would have a huge impact on the least developed countries, including Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia. “This is a life and death decision that Putin has made … Vladimir Putin might be willing to inflict this humanitarian pain on innocents but the US is not,” she said. Power called on other governments, philanthropists and the private sector to match the US contribution by raising an additional $250m. The Ukrainian minister for infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, who was accompanying Power, said he was still hopeful of brokering an agreement with Turkey and the UN that would allow the shipments to continue. Russia has said it could return to the grain deal but only if its demands are met for rules to be eased for its own exports of food and fertiliser. The mayor of Odesa, Gennadiy Trukhanov, said in an interview at Odesa’s grand city administration building that even when the grain deal was active, the city’s port had been working at a maximum of 15% of its prewar capacity. He said most of the 4,000 people who worked at the port had lost their jobs since the start of the war. Trukhanov said the cruise missile strikes in the early hours of Tuesday were “a very crude signal from the Russians to make sure no further ships leave from the port. I can’t imagine there’s any captain who would risk missile strikes and dock here with no guarantees”. The Kremlin said the strikes were in retaliation for Monday’s bridge attack. Ukraine’s air force said six Kalibr missiles and 31 of 36 drones were shot down. Odesa has often been attacked since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The latest strikes were “further proof that the country-terrorist wants to endanger the lives of 400 million people in various countries that depend on Ukrainian food exports”, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential staff, said on Telegram. Moscow, for its part, said it had foiled a Ukrainian drone strike on Crimea, with no major damage on the ground, and reopened a single lane of road traffic on the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine’s foreign minister indicated that Kyiv was willing to give Turkey time to see if it could negotiate Russia’s return to the Black Sea grain deal, but said a way must be found within days to export Ukrainian grain on to the world markets. Dymytro Kuleba said very intensive consultations would be held “in the next hours and days”, adding that Russia’s warning Ukrainian ships would not be protected is “a clear threat formulated in a legally neutral way. What it means is that Russia does not guarantee the safety of any ship that tries to carry Ukrainian cereals from Ukrainian ports to the Bosphorus. We have to understand that as long as Russia is in Crimea and believes it can blackmail and impose its will on anyone, these problems will continue. The best way to solve the problem actually is to defeat Russia and make them withdraw”. He added: “If Turkey wants to have another round of conversations with Russia about the commitment of Russia to the deal that it signed with Turkey, we are fine with that.” Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s termination of the deal meant the “withdrawal of navigation safety guarantees, curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, and restoration of the regime of a temporarily dangerous area in the north-western Black Sea”. “Without appropriate security guarantees, certain risks arise here,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Were a new arrangement to allow for exports “formalised without Russia, then these risks should be taken into account”, Peskov said. The Russian government added it would send its food to the poorest countries in Africa for free. At previous points when the grain deal was close to collapsing, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has persuaded Putin to back down by threatening to send the Turkish navy to escort grain ships out of Ukrainian ports, but positions may now be more entrenched. With Poland saying it would maintain an embargo on Ukrainian grain to protect its own farmers, it becomes even more urgent that Ukrainian grain can use sea routes. The Italian prime minister, Georgia Meloni, gave one of the toughest responses to the end of the deal, saying: “Russia’s decision to terminate the grain deal shows who is a friend and who is an enemy of the poorest states. The leaders of nations who don’t distinguish between the attacked and the aggressor should reflect. Using hunger as a weapon is another crime against humanity.” Andrew Mitchell, the UK’s Africa and development minister, said: “We should make it clear that the impact of what Russia is doing is directly leading to people starving in Africa.” Agencies contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/09/labour-promises-tory-mismanagement-public-finances","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"False hope is even worse than no hope.

Local headteachers I respect and admire were in tears as they described the challenges they are grappling with. The owner of a popular local chippy showed me his energy bill, up from £5,000 a quarter to £11,000, as he shared his fears for his business. A parent showed me a photo of his straight-A son beaten black and blue in the middle of his GCSEs and shared his frustration that he has put more work into the investigation than the police. People are increasingly looking to Labour to get Britain out of this mess. Last week Keir Starmer set out the fifth of Labour’s five missions for government: to smash the class ceiling that holds back kids from working-class backgrounds like mine. Taken together with our ambition to build an NHS fit for the future out of the ashes of the worst crisis in its history, to make our streets safe, to deliver clean power by 2030 and to get our economy racing ahead of the world, with the benefits shared so that we’re all better off, Keir’s missions amount to an ambitious vision of what our country can look like in the 2030s. Labour faces two big hurdles – both largely of the Conservatives’ making, both of which will make our job more difficult. The first is the car crash of the public finances. The Conservatives’ ideological joyride of a budget last year has left everyone paying the price through higher rents, higher mortgages and higher bills. Keir and Rachel Reeves face tougher choices than Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in 1997. As Keir said in his conference speech in September, this means there will be good Labour things we want to do but won’t be able to promise. We face a huge deficit of trust in politics too. It’s a far bigger problem for us than it is for the Tories. As Britain’s progressive party, Labour is where people turn when they believe things can get better. When cynicism wins, so do the Tories. It falls to us to win public confidence in the Labour party and in the ability of politics to be a force for good. That’s why we are being so careful to only make promises we know we can keep. The only thing worse than no hope is false hope. It will disappoint some of our friends that we are not pledging support for every cause they believe in. But it would be so much more damaging to make promises now and then break them after the election. Ask the Lib Dems what far-fetched promises on tuition fees did for them. As shadow health secretary I have a challenging public service brief. It is not always easy being unable to pull the spending lever. But that is exactly why Keir and Rachel are right to prioritise economic growth, because that’s the only way we are going to be able to give the NHS and other public services the investment they need. Imagine Britain leading the G7 with the highest sustained economic growth, with a million more jobs in green energy, with an NHS fit for the future, safe streets and a trusted justice system, and with every child, whatever their background, having the best start in life. That will be Labour’s platform at the next general election, and because we are making the hard choices necessary for government, it will be a platform you can trust us to deliver. • Wes Streeting is shadow health secretary and MP for Ilford North"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-19T17:02:24Z","webTitle":"‘A feminist symbol’: how the humble ponytail scored a summer winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","fields":{"bodyText":"Reaching the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday is, of course, a massive achievement for England, writes Lauren Cochrane. But the team also have another important distinction to enjoy – they have helped make the humble ponytail the hairstyle of the summer. Celebrating Alessia Russo’s goal on Wednesday against Australia, ponytails swung from the heads of most of the team – from Russo herself to fellow goal scorers Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone, as well as Chloe Kelly, Georgia Stanway, Alex Greenwood and Rachel Daly. While the hairstyle is no doubt a practical measure to ensure hair is kept away from the face while playing football, the ponytail has taken precedence over equally serviceable buns and shorter hair during this tournament. The fact that it is the hairstyle also worn by busy women across the world everyday has helped some of those watching identify with the players. “The ponytail is a feminist symbol,” said Jacqueline Kilikita, acting beauty director of Refinery29, a US-based lifestyle website. “It indicates power and confidence – showing your face to the world and getting things done in style.” The England team are not the only template for the ponytail this summer: Margot Robbie as Barbie wears a high ponytail and has inspired others to try the same look. There have been more than 132m views of videos with the hashtag #barbieponytail on TikTok, and Pinterest has reported that searches for “Barbie ponytail” went up 190% from January to April. “Sport and Barbie could be seen at opposite ends of the spectrum, but a blond ponytail is fusing the two together in a very satisfying unity,” said Tom Smith, hairstylist and trend forecaster. If the style had previously been seen as only for those with Caucasian hair, it has been embraced by women of colour this summer. Black women on TikTok have gone viral with their takes on the Barbie ponytail. In the England squad, star striker Lauren James, who was still suspended for last Wednesday’s game against Australia, also wears a ponytail style with her textured hair. “It’s more popular than ever and great for those who prefer a lower- maintenance hairstyle that requires little to no styling,” said Tina Farey, the editorial director of Rush, a hair and beauty company. “Although simple, it still looks chic and classy.”Ponytails have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece, and taking in soldiers in the 18th century, French film star Brigitte Bardot in the 1960s and Janet Jackson and Madonna in the 1990s. Kilikita said that the recent ponytail revival is part of a wider trend for looking back. “I think the ponytail’s comeback has been a long time coming, considering our love for nostalgic hairstyles,” she said. “I associate it with my school days.” It has, she added, “usurped the messy 90s bun as the hairstyle of the summer”. To achieve a ponytail worthy of the England team, Smith recommends hair that is not freshly washed and adding dry shampoo. “An easy hack I teach my clients is to do it in two stages: first, just [put up] the hair over your crown in a ponytail, then join up the remainder,” he said. “It gives loads of extra volume and allows you to pull out the edges, getting it less flat to your head without making the ponytail slip.” As for those in the England team, Kilikita has a theory on how their ponytails stay in place: “I think it’s a good hair elastic – or a hair bungee, a professional hair tie enlisted by the very best hairstylists – a large paddle brush and lots of gel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-01T05:20:25Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: a powerful end to one of the best new cop shows in ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","fields":{"bodyText":"Blue Lights 9pm, BBC One After last week’s Operation Farset disaster, the final episode is spent praying for Gerry (Richard Dormer) to pull through – and it’s a powerful end to what has been an excellent new cop show.

Russia’s permanent representative to the body, Vasily Nebenzya, told Interfax on Friday that Moscow must “protect” the Zaporizhzhia plant. A withdrawal of its troops would make the facility “vulnerable … to provocations and terrorist attacks”, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had earlier called for all military personnel and equipment to be pulled out, saying the plant “should not be used as part of any military operations” and a demilitarised zone needed to be agreed. Both the US and France backed Guterres’ appeal. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, said officials must visit the plant as soon as possible. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour,” Grossi told the UN security council. Ukraine and Russia on Friday accused each other of risking nuclear catastrophe at the plant, which lies on the opposite bank of a reservoir from several Ukrainian-held towns and cities that have come under intense shelling from the Russian-held side. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said Ukraine was shelling the plant itself. “They say it’s Russia,” he wrote on Telegram. “That’s obviously 100% nonsense, even for the stupid Russophobic public.” Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, added: “They say it happens purely by chance, like ‘we didn’t mean to’. What can I say? Let’s not forget that the European Union also has nuclear power plants. And accidents can happen there, too.” Ukraine’s Energoatom agency, whose workers still operate the plant under Russian occupation, said it was struck five times on Thursday, including near where radioactive materials are stored. Kyiv said Russian troops struck it themselves, and were also using the plant as a shield to provide cover while they bombard nearby Ukrainian-held towns and cities. “The Ukrainian armed forces do not damage the infrastructure [of the plant], do not strike where there may be a danger on a global scale,” the army spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told national television. “We understand that the invaders are hiding behind such a shield because it is not possible to strike there.” Earlier this week, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, in the knowledge it would be too dangerous for Ukraine to return fire. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, demanded Russia return the plant to Ukraine’s control. “Only a full withdrawal of the Russians … and the restoration of full Ukrainian control of the situation around the station can guarantee a resumption of nuclear security for all of Europe,” he said in his latest video address. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, has previously warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster, he said, adding that “such insane actions could lead to … a Fukushima or Chornobyl”. Grossi said he was ready to lead an international expert mission to inspect the site in south-eastern Ukraine and called on Russia and Ukraine to cooperate so officials could travel as soon as possible. “Time is of the essence,” he told the 15-member security council late on Thursday, adding that the agency could perform urgent work on safeguards and provide a stabilising influence in order “to prevent a nuclear accident”. Fighting has intensified in recent days in anticipation of what Ukraine says is a planned counteroffensive in the south. The country’s general staff on Friday reported shelling and air attacks by Russian forces on scores of towns and bases. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the eastern Donetsk region, said on Telegram seven civilians had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours. Britain’s defence ministry said on Friday that explosions earlier this week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea were “almost certainly” the result of the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas. It did not say what the exact cause of the blasts was but said at least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets appeared to have been destroyed or seriously damaged. The airfield itself, while seriously damaged, probably remained serviceable, the report added. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack or explained how it was carried out. Russia has denied aircraft were damaged and said the explosions at the base were accidental."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
