Every weekday evening, tens of thousands of Filipinos, many living abroad, would tune in to listen to his news commentary and sharp humour. But on this evening, as Mabasa drove up to the entrance of his gated community where his studio is located in Las Piñas, Metro Manila, a motorbike began to trail him. Footage taken by a camera on the back of his car, and since released by police, shows two figures on the bike pulling up alongside him. Then gunshots can be heard. There’s a bang as Mabasa’s car slams into the vehicle in front. The motorbike turns and drives away. Mabasa was killed instantly. Mabasa, who was better known by his professional name, Percy Lapid, spent his 35-year career as a journalist highlighting corruption among the powerful. His killing has amplified calls for the authorities to finally act on the longstanding and deadly threats facing media workers in the Philippines. It also brought to light serious allegations of wrongdoing by some of the country’s most senior officials. The authorities say they have identified 160 persons of interest in relation to the killing, but they have focused on officials at the top of the country’s prison system. In November, investigators at the Philippine national police (PNP) and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) accused the bureau of corrections chief, Gerald Bantag, and his deputy security officer, Ricardo Zulueta of arranging the murder through prison inmates. Charges have not been filed in court. According to Eugene Javier, of the NBI, who announced the allegations at a press conference, investigators have uncovered “the unfortunate transformation of a pillar of justice, the correction pillar, into a deep, large-scale and systematic criminal organisation”. It was Mabasa’s “continued exposé of Bantag” that had driven the latter to organise the killing, Javier alleged. Killings of journalists are not uncommon in the Philippines, but justice for such attacks is. Of the 197 journalists killed since democracy was restored in 1986 after the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, close to 60 have led to convictions, said Jonathan de Santos, the chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines. “Often a prosecution in these cases is focused on the actual gunmen, the actual killers,” he said. It is highly unusual for the masterminds to be identified. Bantag, who was appointed by the former president Rodrigo Duterte, has denied any involvement, and has filed a motion for inhibition, claiming department of justice prosecutors lack impartiality and should not be involved in the case. He has accused the justice secretary, Jesus Crispin Remulla, of having political ambitions and trying to use the case to raise his own profile. Zulueta has, in comments given by his lawyer, also denied any wrongdoing. Remulla said the allegations against the pair were based on the “totality” of evidence gathered, including testimonies by the self-confessed gunman – who alleged a prison inmate was a middle man in the killing – prisoners, Facebook messages and bank records. In the aftermath of Mabasa’s killing, his family, including his six children and four grandchildren, have avoided going outside, fearing further attacks. His brother, Roy Mabasa, has stayed at a different location each night and travels in borrowed cars to avoid being followed. The family were offered police protection but declined. “At this moment, we don’t know yet who our real enemies are,” Roy said. Threats of violence Born in Manila in 1959, Percy Mabasa grew up under the rule of Ferdinand Marcos Sr, and he was a teenager when the late dictator imposed martial law, one of the darkest periods in the country’s modern history, when thousands were tortured, killed or jailed. Newspapers, radio stations and TV stations were closed, causing huge numbers of journalists, including Mabasa’s father, a radio commentator, to lose their jobs. Mabasa’s father left the city to avoid the authorities, and the family survived on the mother’s income from selling food at a market. “It was probably those upbringings that made us aware of injustices and what is good for the country,” Roy said. Throughout Mabasa’s career, his belief in calling out wrongdoing never wavered, but it came at a cost. “In the span of 35 years, he was removed by radio stations nearly 100 times because of his brand of commentary,” said Roy. Each time Mabasa challenged a powerful person, that person would call the station and ask for him to be sacked. “Libel was like breakfast, lunch and dinner for Percy. I knew the agony looking at his face. He considered it as part of the job,” said Roy. There were also threats of violence – though over the past decade, he tended not to talk about these, perhaps fearing that his children would worry, added Roy. According to Remulla, Bantag may have been motivated by one of Mabasa’s recent reports – an exposé alleging that an official from the justice department was leading a luxurious lifestyle. “There are more damaging commentaries Percy made on other people,” said Roy. Many of his commentaries targeted Duterte, who was not included on the list of 160 people cited as being of interest to the police, said Roy. A broken system Since Mabasa’s death, calls for reform have grown. The killing has brought into focus the flaws in the Philippines’ penal system, including how a lack of resources and severe overcrowding can complicate relations between prison staff and inmates, creating the potential for exploitation. The president, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, while acknowledging that investigations were ongoing, accused Bantag of having established his “own fiefdom” inside New Bilibid prison. After Bantag’s suspension, weapons, alcohol, methamphetamine and mobile phones were discovered inside the prison. It emerged that a large pit had been dug close to his quarters, and a menagerie of horses, game fowl and snakes was being kept onsite. Bantag has told local media he was building a swimming pool to train prison staff in scuba diving so they could help with rescue efforts during bad weather. The horses were used to travel through the compound, while the snakes were used for pest control, he said. He maintains he has been unfairly targeted. His fight, he said recently, “is for the small and ordinary Filipino”, adding: “If they can do this to me, then [they can do] much more to the small folk.” Roy hopes that whoever was the real mastermind behind Mabasa’s killing will be brought to justice, and that his brother’s death will finally prompt broader action to protect journalists in the Philippines. The deaths of all other journalists killed since the fall of Marcos Sr should be investigated, he said. Libel laws that have been used repeatedly to harass journalists through the courts, including the Nobel prize winner Maria Ressa, who faces decades in prison for her journalism, should also be re-examined. “The death of Percy should be an eye-opener to all our politicians. There is no more time for us to put everything under the rug every time that a journalist is being killed,” said Roy. “Now is the time to act.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T10:59:55Z","webTitle":"March of the unicorns: Israel’s tech sector rebels against Netanyahu ‘power grab’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/israel-tech-sector-rebels-against-netanyahu-power-grab","fields":{"bodyText":"About 20 years ago, the skyline of Tel Aviv began to change. The city’s collection of elegant white Bauhaus buildings has been joined by tower after tower, each one a salute to Israel’s rapid transformation into one of the world’s most important advanced technology centres. It is no accident that the rise of the “startup nation” has dovetailed with the career of its longest serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Bibi, as he is widely known, is a firm believer in the free market and has championed Israel’s vaunted hi-tech sector as his own personal achievement. At 15.3% of GDP, it is now Israel’s main engine of economic growth, employing 10% of the country’s salaried workforce, and generating about a quarter of income taxes. Which perhaps makes it all the more surprising that the tech sector is now rebelling against the prime minister over government proposals to neuter the Israeli judiciary. Spooked by predictions of the end of democracy and the rule of law, Israel’s entrepreneurial class, previously seemingly immune to the political weather, has joined the hundreds of thousands of people striking and marching as part of the country’s biggest ever protest movement. The protests on Thursday hit the arrival of US defence secretary Lloyd Austin as thousands of Israelis opposed to the government’s legal reform plans blocked roads in and around Ben Gurion airport, forcing an eleventh hour change of venue for Austin’s talks. There are increasing signs too the famously resilient tech sector is under pressure. A recent report by the Israeli business publication Calcalist suggested that 85bn shekels (£20bn) in capital has been taken out of Israel in the two months since the new government was sworn in and the shekel was the world’s third worst-performing currency in February, falling to a three-year low against the dollar. Economists globally have predicted a possible downgrade of Israel’s credit rating – unwelcome news for the hi-tech sector, which by some estimates is 90% funded by outside investors. A handful of industry leaders have been vocal about moving funding outside the country, while many more appear to have done so quietly. Eynat Guez, the CEO and co-founder of Papaya Global, a payroll software “unicorn” worth more than $1bn, was the first to publicly do so in January. “This is beyond left or right, it’s that the reforms are simply a power grab,” she said. “We live in a dangerous neighbourhood, and despite that we have built this industry and gained investor trust. “If this is the end of the tech industry in Israel – not because of the economy, because of politics – it will take a decade for anyone to forgive and forget that. It will destroy the economic future of the next generation.” Netanyahu returned to office in December at the head of the most rightwing government in Israeli history. Various elements of the coalition wish to annex the occupied West Bank, roll back pro-LGBTQ+ legislation, limit freedom of speech and give the Knesset the power to appoint supreme court judges and overturn the court’s decisions. Proponents say it is necessary to fix the balance of power across different branches of the state, and counter a perceived leftwing bias in the court’s rulings. Critics point out the changes would help the prime minister evade a conviction in his corruption trial, in which he denies all charges, and undermine democratic norms in a country with no formal constitution. Despite the protests, and polling that shows the vast majority of the public are against the judicial changes in their current form, the government appears to be rushing towards passing the legislation before the Knesset’s winter session ends for the Passover holiday in a few weeks’ time. Israeli media reported on Tuesday that the president, Isaac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, had been pushing the government and the opposition towards a compromise that would “soften” the proposals, a plan expected to be made public in the next few days. For many of those opposed to the government’s plans, however, compromise is not a welcome prospect. “You can’t compromise on a coup,” Guez said. “Pilots are saying they won’t serve [in the military], doctors are striking. We love Israel and want to defend it. That doesn’t mean you just obey the people currently in charge.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/20/even-boris-johnson-given-up-partygate-fight-rishi-sunak","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-20T11:14:52Z","webTitle":"Even Boris Johnson seems to have given up the Partygate fight – he knows his power is waning | Katy Balls","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/even-boris-johnson-given-up-partygate-fight-rishi-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/20/even-boris-johnson-given-up-partygate-fight-rishi-sunak","fields":{"bodyText":"In the buildup to the privileges committee’s inquiry into whether Boris Johnson intentionally misled parliament over Covid breaches, the former prime minister and his supporters refused to go down without a fight. Team Johnson repeatedly questioned the integrity of the committee, likening it to a kangaroo court. When Johnson received a draft copy of the report stating that he had indeed misled parliament, the former prime minister was so angry that he quit, slamming its findings ahead of publication and labelling it a “witch-hunt”. His key ally Nadine Dorries warned that “any Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public”, adding: “deselections may follow. It’s serious.” And yet, very few Tory MPs appear to have taken Dorries that seriously. When the report – along with its recommendation of banning Johnson from having the Commons pass former MPs are entitled to – came to a vote on Monday night, 118 Tory MPs voted in favour. Only six MPs went against it, with Dorries, who is yet to officially quit despite announcing her intention to do so, notably absent. “Nadine’s gone missing,” joked one minister. Even Johnson appears to have got cold feet, signalling to his allies that they should not oppose the report as he “wants to move on”. While this has been read in some quarters as a small peace offering from Johnson to Sunak, it’s also the case that the former prime minister will have been keen to avoid a repeat of the Windsor framework embarrassment in March, when he signalled his intention to vote against Sunak’s Brexit deal only for a mere 21 Tory MPs to follow suit. “That was the moment he exposed how little support he has,” says one government aide. The majority of Tory MPs, including the prime minister, opted to abstain on last night’s vote. This has landed badly with some of the MPs who stayed late in the chamber to vote in favour of the report. “He should have been there,” says a member of the 2019 intake. “It would show Boris has no power.” While No 10 insists Sunak had diary clashes, his absence was in part because ministers wanted to drain the vote of drama. It also shows that he is not looking to intensify the fight between himself and Johnson after last week’s war of words over the peerages row. That’s in part because Sunak doesn’t want to further antagonise the MPs in the Commons who remain loyal to Johnson. As one put it: “I’m being a team player and staying away from the vote. Having a fight with the prime minister isn’t going to help me keep my seat.” Several MPs chose drinks at the Conservative Home summer reception over sitting in the debate. “The story is that we’re here and no one is talking about Boris. It’s a non-event,” insisted one Tory MP. Others argue that Johnson has dropped in public relevance. “I have received virtually no mail on the privileges committee or Boris quitting,” says a minister. One “red wall” MP says they have received about six pieces of correspondence on the issue, but it was split into pro and anti. It means there is hope that Johnson’s exit will not be the lightning rod for more Tory psychodrama, and instead could mark the beginning of a calmer chapter. The problem for Sunak is there is little optimism in the party about the next few months. Instead, a sense of fatigue has set in. “It all feels quite bleak,” says a government aide. The disclosure of a damaging Partygate video – and the police considering a new investigation – means that even with Johnson out of the chamber the scandal could drag on. The ticking timebomb on mortgages is raising concern that 2024 – when the next general election is due to be held – could be a year of more economic pain rather than a Tory recovery. Sunak’s Johnson problem may be reducing, but elsewhere others are mounting.

But do political motives, determine how many, and which, newspapers are on offer in the first place? High-profile owners with clear agendas mean most of us suspect the answer is yes, but I’ve never seen rigorous evidence to prove it. That is until now, with a Warwick University study. It examines the case of India, the world’s largest democracy, which has a booming newspaper market of well over 100,000 publications. Back in the 00s, the electoral landscape for state legislature elections was redrawn to reflect the latest census, with some districts gaining and others losing representatives. Since that hadn’t been done since 1974, despite significant population shifts, it meant big changes to the relative electoral importance of some districts over others. The districts that were politically important changed almost overnight. What happened in areas that became more important? They saw more, and higher circulation of, papers in the following years as owners reacted to changes in the political landscape. The impact was greatest on local language journals, which are more likely to cover the ins and outs of local politics. Now obviously, political motives are far from everything when it comes to newspapers – profit plays its part. Yet the researchers estimate that 12-18% of newspaper circulation after the electoral changes was because of politics. So you can read this research to be convinced that those controlling our media aren’t exactly disinterested in controlling our politics. Or maybe you don’t need to. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation. Read more at resolutionfoundation.org Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Closing the conference of 46 European leaders held at a castle 12 miles (19km) from the border with Ukraine, the country’s president spoke of the importance of overturning Russian’s supremacy in the air with a “sky shield” involving a combination of Patriot missiles and F-16s. He also won support from Rishi Sunak in his battle for accelerated membership of Nato. “Why Patriots? Because Patriots have shown the world they can take down any kind of Russian missiles. Our proposal is to build a sky shield over the European continent. It’s important to build it for the whole of Europe, starting with our territory,” he told reporters at the European political summit in Chișinău. After an 11-year-old and her mother and another woman were killed in overnight missile attacks on Kyiv, Zelenskiy said the “protection of our skies” was vital because it would first and foremost protect the people of Ukraine and “our children”. Several countries, including the UK, Denmark, Poland, the Netherlands and Belgium, have said they want to help procure F-16s for Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, endorsed training programmes last month for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s, but the training will take months to complete and western countries have not yet said they will supply the jets. Senior sources involved in the F-16 coalition said the jets could be operational in six months’ time and be useful during the war or as a stabilising factor in a postwar scenario. The Dutch and Polish prime ministers progressed the timeline for delivery of the planes during a roundtable discussion that also included their Danish, Belgian, Norwegian and Swedish counterparts. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said the meeting had gone very well. “We agreed to train Ukrainian pilots. Of course the UK does not have F-16s, but you have fighter jets and Rishi Sunak agreed to participate in the training exercise for Ukrainian pilots, training also for the logistics around these F-16s, the maintenance, introducing them to the Ukrainian aircraft system. We all agreed the next steps.” Russia has said that providing Ukraine with F-16s would be a “colossal risk” for western nations. The Moldova conference gave Zelenskiy an opportunity to see most of his main allies in one afternoon after he drove to the summit from an overnight visit to Odesa. Sunak said: “I agree with the Nato secretary general that Ukraine’s rightful place is in Nato and what we are also talking to Ukraine about right now is making sure they have all the support they need for a successful counteroffensive.” The British prime minister said he was proud of the UK’s record in supporting Ukraine. “We want to make sure we put in place security arrangements for Ukraine for the long term, so we send a very strong signal to Vladimir Putin that we are not going anywhere, we are here to stay and we will continue backing Ukraine – not just now but for years into the future,” he said. Zelenskiy’s plea for security guarantees for his country and Moldova came 24 hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had called on the international community to make a “tangible and credible” offer. Such guarantees were in the rest of the continent’s interest, he said. “We have to build something between the security provided to Israel and full-fledged membership,” he said. Zelenskiy did not give details of the proposal but said he was in talks with “the US and other partners about the security guarantees compact”. “We do we need them because we are not in Nato. If we were, Russia would not attack us”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/22/russia-nuclear-threats-totally-unacceptable-says-un-chief-antonio-guterres","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T17:43:52Z","webTitle":"Russia’s nuclear threats ‘totally unacceptable’, says UN chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/russia-nuclear-threats-totally-unacceptable-says-un-chief-antonio-guterres","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/22/russia-nuclear-threats-totally-unacceptable-says-un-chief-antonio-guterres","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general has issued a strongly worded rebuke to Russia for “totally unacceptable” nuclear threats and denounced its plans to annex parts of Ukraine as a “violation of the UN charter and of international law”. António Guterres also said the impact of the conflict could cause a food supply crisis next year. “Simply put the world will run out of food,” he said. Guterres was speaking at the start of a UN security council meeting the day after Vladimir Putin raised the stakes in his invasion of Ukraine, announcing a partial mobilisation and threatening the use of nuclear weapons “if the territorial integrity of our country is threatened”. Putin also approved referendums in four Ukrainian regions intended to pave the way for annexation, raising the prospect that he would then deem Ukrainian operations to recapture them as a threat to Russia’s “territorial integrity”. The US president, Joe Biden, rejected the nuclear threat as reckless, and Ukraine’s backers said they would not be deterred from providing military support. “The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate. This in itself is totally unacceptable,” Guterres said. “I’m also deeply concerned by reports of plans to organise so-called referenda in areas of Ukraine that are not currently under government control,” he said. “Any annexation of a state’s territory by another state resulting from a threat or use of force is a violation of the UN charter and of international law.” Russia was widely condemned at Thursday’s security council meeting chaired by the French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, repeated Beijing’s line that the UN charter and territorial integrity must be supported, without directly criticising Russia, which is an ally. Wang did not, however, offer Moscow any rhetorical support in a carefully worded address. The council was briefed by the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan, on the investigation of mass graves found in Ukrainian towns liberated from Russian occupation. Khan said the “echoes of Nuremberg should be heard today”, invoking the precedent set by the war crimes trials of the Nazis. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, did not address Guterres’s comment, repeating Moscow’s discredited claims that Ukraine was being run by “neo-Nazis” and the war had been caused by mistreatment of Russian speakers in the Donbas. He said Russia had no confidence in the ICC. Lavrov was not in the chamber for the ministers who spoke before him, and left as soon as he had delivered his own address. The expansion of Russian conscription, initially intended to draft 300,000 soldiers, has triggered protests around Russia and an exodus of military-age men. Putin’s escalation of the war in the face of territorial losses to Ukrainian forces has led to a new round of sanctions being considered. EU foreign ministers agreed in Brussels to prepare a new package expected to include broad economic and individual measures. Guterres also pointed to the success of the UN-brokered Black Sea grain initiative in exporting more than 4.3m tonnes of food, as a result of which he said food prices had dropped sharply. But he said a drop in Russian exports of fertiliser and ammonia was creating already causing shortages in West Africa and elsewhere. “If the fertiliser market is not stabilised next year it could bring the food supply crisis,” he said. In his speech on Wednesday Biden said that food and fertiliser were not subject to international sanctions. “Let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow – explicitly allow – Russia the ability to export food and fertiliser. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it,” he said. Speaking at Thursday’s security council session, the UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said similar and blamed Moscow for the crisis. “Let us be clear, we are not sanctioning food,” he said. “It is Russia’s actions that are preventing food and fertiliser getting to developing countries. It is Russia’s tactics and bombs that are to blame for destroying Ukraine’s farms infrastructure and delaying its exports.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T05:48:53Z","webTitle":"Jellyfish have a proud history of ruining nuclear power plants all over the world | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","fields":{"bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/09/chinas-rising-power-and-influence-in-the-pacific-explained-in-30-seconds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T23:57:45Z","webTitle":"China’s rising power and influence in the Pacific explained in 30 seconds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/09/chinas-rising-power-and-influence-in-the-pacific-explained-in-30-seconds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/09/chinas-rising-power-and-influence-in-the-pacific-explained-in-30-seconds","fields":{"bodyText":"Located between the US, China and Australia, the Pacific island countries hold strategic importance for security and defence. The US has long maintained influence and a military presence in the Pacific region. Over the last decade, China has focused on strengthening its ties in Pacific through increased aid, development, diplomacy and security cooperation. In 2022, Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China, sparking international concern over the possibility of Beijing building its first military base in the region. At the same time, the US ramped up its Pacific diplomacy, hosting a landmark Pacific leaders summit and whirlwind tours by senior officials, including vice-president Kamala Harris, and pledged more aid. In February the US reopened an embassy in Solomons Islands after a 30 year absence. Australia, which had been accused of neglecting its own relationship with Pacific countries, has also conducted a diplomatic push amid fears of Chinese influence growing in the region. Australia has also overtaken China as the “leading source of bilateral loans to the Pacific,” according to 2022 data from the Lowy Institute. The amount of development finance China has provided to the region has been falling since 2016, according to the data, which the institute said “does not contradict recent perceptions that China has sought to ‘increase its engagement’ with Pacific Island countries.” Instead, China appears to be focusing on strengthening security cooperation, as with the Solomon Islands deal, and increasing commercial activities. Re-engagement by the US has continued, with encouragement from Pacific leaders. In early 2023, the presidents of Kiribati, Palau, Nauru, the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia said they expect US president Joe Biden would visit the Pacific in the “near future”, though the trip has not been confirmed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-16T10:14:08Z","webTitle":"Shetland residents still without power as engineers battle snow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/16/shetland-blackout-power-homes-snow","fields":{"bodyText":"Hundreds of homes on Shetland face being without power until early next week as engineers battle tough road and weather conditions, five days after last Monday’s widespread blackout. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, which has shipped in 125 emergency engineers, convoys of 4x4s and mobile generators to Shetland this week, said it could take until at least Monday to restore supplies to about 800 homes and businesses in West Mainland. Their warning came as a large part of west central Scotland and parts of the southern Highlands were placed under an amber severe weather warning for snow until midday on Friday, with forecasts that up to 20cm could fall on higher ground. The runway at Glasgow airport was closed for several hours this morning for a clear-up operation to remove ice and snow, causing significant disruption to flight schedules. After midday, the Met Office issued a new yellow warning for ice, covering the Dumfries, Galloway, Lothian and Borders, and Strathclyde weather areas and running through the night until 10.30am on Saturday. The amber alert was issued by the Met Office just before 5am and only an hour before it came into force, leaving many commuters and commercial drivers little time to prepare. Traffic agencies and police reported a series of collisions, numerous breakdowns and impassable roads before and during rush hour, including the closure of parts of the M8 east of Glasgow after an accident and reports of vehicles stuck in snow near Inveraray, Argyll. Police in mid Argyll and Kintyre, west of Loch Lomond, advised all motorists to stay clear of the A83 and A85 trunk roads due to the heavy snow and reports of vehicles getting stuck, including an HGV on the notorious Rest and Be Thankful stretch of the A83. SSEN said that by 10.45pm on Thursday, about 1,700 properties were still without power in parts of West Mainland, Voe and Brae. “Helicopter surveys and foot patrols have now provided engineers with a clear picture of the extent of the damage, enabling teams to segment the network and make progress in restoring customer supplies area by area,” the company said. “This work has been essential to the rebuilding of the ‘backbone’ of the network. “Subject to no unforeseen challenges, we expect sustained progress over the next 48 hours and are targeting the restoration of the large majority of supplies by Sunday. “Given the extent of damage and access issues in the West Mainland, particularly west of Bixter, it is now anticipated that some properties in this area will be reconnected by the early part of next week. We are continuing to make every effort to improve on this if we can.” Shetland Islands council, SSEN, the police and other agencies have set up 20 “warm hubs” to offer hot drinks, kitchen facilities, fuel, broadband connections and a heated space for those without power. Dr Susan Bowie, the GP at Hillswick surgery in north-west Mainland, told BBC Scotland they had no heating: “It’s really cold at the surgery. You can’t stay there too long because your hands get so cold, but there’s been a real community spirit about this situation. “The roads are terrible but the staff have come in, they have done their best. We are wearing coats, jumpers and fleeces just to stay warm.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T15:30:51Z","webTitle":"Energy support for businesses to cost ‘tens of billions’, Rees-Mogg says; firms and schools fear cliff edge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time to recap…. Britain is facing tens of billions of pounds of extra borrowing to cover the cost of protecting businesses, public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals, and charities from the full force of the energy crisis. The UK government announced it will cap wholesale electricity and gas costs for non-domestic users at less than half the market rate expected this winter from the start of October. The plan, two weeks after outlining protection for households, could avert a winter catastrophe for businesses. The package will only initially last for six months – with further help potentially to be offered to vulnerable firms and organisations that need more support beyond March. Under the plan, wholesale prices for electricity are expected to be capped at 21.1p/kWh, while gas would be capped at 7.5p/kWh – for those on existing fixed price contracts. Those on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs, up to a maximum amount. Analysts at Cornwall Insight said the move would effectively reset the market back to last spring’s price levels, before the surge in wholesale energy prices this summer as Russia tightened the screw on Europe. They estimate it will cost £25bn. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan would “stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs and limit inflation,”. But the announcement, in a press release, meant MPs were not able to quiz ministers about the plan. Costing details could come in Friday’s mini-budget. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told broadcasters that the final cost of the scheme would “unquestionably” run into “tens of billions” of pounds, but couldn’t give a precise amount – as it all depends how high electricity and gas prices rise this winter. Investec estimate the plan could cost up to £48bn. Business groups broadly welcomed the plan, saying it would help firms keep running through the winter. But several groups warned that further help will be needed; Make UK, the manufacturers’ trade body, warned prices could “remain high for many months to come”. Labour warned that the plan came too late for some businesses, saying the delay in providing support was ‘farcical’. The package has also been criticised for not being better targeted. As Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee Chair Darren Jones put it: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” However, Resolution Foundation points out that companies on long-term contracts, paying less than the government’s new cap, won’t quality for savings – reducing the total cost. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said a six-month cap made it “impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence”. Hospitality firms, nurseries and breweries all warned that ministers are creating a cliff edge in March 2023, when the cap will end. Councils in England and Wales said they needed more help to get them though the cost of living crisis. Here’s the full story: And a detailed explainer: In other news… The UK borrowed almost twice as much as expected in August, at over £11.8bn, as soaring inflation pushed up the cost of index-linked debt. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, at just $1.1325. The foreign exchange markets were shaken by Vladimir Putin who has ordered Russia’s first military mobilisation since World War Two, and accused the West of nuclear blackmail. The government has been warned that cuts to stamp duty will hurt first-time buyers and stoke an inflationary bubble in the property market – following reports that Liz Truss is planning to lower the tax to encourage growth. Economists have called for a shake-up of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee…. … which is expected to announce another increase in UK interest rates tomorrow. Could we see the biggest rise since the late 1980s? The BoE is also been urged to condemn the government’s move to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses – given its previous calls for wage restraint. The GMB union argued that governor Andrew Bailey should speak out, asking; “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The energy crisis has forced Germany to nationalise its biggest gas importer, Uniper, to avert a crisis as it battles energy shortages resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer is increasing staff pay for the second time this year and providing 4,500 employees with a £250 shopping voucher as part of a £15m package to help with the rising cost of living. In a grim development, more than 5 million Britons have gone without food, according to new research that reveals people are skipping meals “just to keep the lights on”. Nearly 11 million people are now behind on their bills, the Money Advice Trust reported. Online gambling firm Betway has been fined more than £400,000 after its marketing material was found on the children’s section of the West Ham United website, including a page where young fans were invited to colour in a teddy bear. And French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone…which could herald a shake-up at the mobile giant. Over in New York, Liz Truss has told executives at a business roundtable in New York that boosting the City of London will help to level up the UK. Truss argued that promoting the financial sector (where the government controversially wants to lift the cap on bonuses) will actually help the rest of the country. She said: We want the City to be the most competitive place for financial services in the world, and we see that as a key part of the levelling up agenda, because when we unblock capital, that capital will be used across the UK to make every industry become more productive and competitive. Andy Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has all the details: Financial service group Investec have estimated that the non-domestic price cap could cost anywhere between £22bn and £48bn. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield explains: In the absence of official numbers, our utilities team tentatively suggest a range of £22bn-£48bn as a cost for the non-domestic energy support package over its initial six-month period. Adding this to what may be a price tag of close to £90bn for household energy bill support, as per our utilities analyst, it is clear that the government is prepared to commit substantial amounts of government funding to provide support with surging energy prices. To put these figures into context, furlough for employees and the self-employed cost £97bn, close to 4% of GDP. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, warns that the UK still faces a recession, despite the government’s energy support. Pugh agrees that non-domestic customers face a cliff edge next spring, which will deter firms from investing. Energy prices for businesses were only frozen for six months at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 MWh for natural gas. Given that electricity prices in April 2023 are currently around £360 per MWh, this could represent a cliff edge in spring after what will undoubtedly be an exceptionally tough winter. That risks productive investment being deferred or cancelled and otherwise viable firms going bust, making the economy permanently smaller. RSM estimates that the household energy bill freeze, announced a fortnight ago, means inflation will peak at 11% in October, not 15% in January as feared. That means a less severe recession: What’s more, the smaller impact on household incomes means that consumer spending will fall by less and the recession will be shallower. We’re now expecting a peak-to-trough drop of around 0.5% of GDP, down from 1.5%. Here’s a handy explanation about what today’s announcement means for business owners, and those running schools, hospitals and charities too: The plan to cap energy costs has also been welcomed by the steel industry, one of the energy-intensive sectors hit hard by soaring gas and electricity bills. Director General of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the cap will help industry get through the winter. “The Business Secretary’s announcement today demonstrates that this new Government understands the sheer scale of the issue and the need to deliver a significant solution swiftly. Setting a price cap for electricity at £211/MWh for six months gives foundation sectors, such as steel, the chance to get through the winter by giving us a competitive business landscape. The Government has clearly listened to sectors such as steel, estimated the enormity of the challenge that energy intensive sectors face, and today has delivered. The Resolution Foundation have given the energy package a fairly warm welcome – saying it’s well-targeted at tackling soaring bills. They argue it strikes the ‘right balance’ between tackling businesses’ soaring bills, while avoiding offering support for businesses who don’t need it [because their energy costs are still below the new price cap]. Emily Fry, Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Today’s welcome package of support for business strikes the right balance of preventing firms being hit with soaring bills this winter, while encouraging them to become more energy efficient, and avoiding giving support to firms on longer term energy contracts who frankly don’t need it. “Today’s package requires another large cheque from a government already grappling with higher borrowing. But, unlike with support for households, that cheque is not blank – reflecting limits on the size of the discount firms can receive. “Overall, the Government’s energy bills support package is welcome, but expensive, and could easily cost over £100 billion. The refusal to cover more of this cost with windfall and solidarity taxes will add pressure on the Bank of England to up the pace and scale of interest rate rises, which will start to be felt by mortgagors in the months ahead.” The Bank of England could hit borrowers with more financial pain tomorrow, when it announces its latest interest rate move (almost certainly a sharp rise). Trading in financial markets reflects an 80% probability of a 0.75 percentage point increase, which would mark the biggest single rate increase since 1989, when inflation was soaring during a consumer boom before the onset of the early 1990s recession. However, experts said the Bank pushing ahead with the biggest rate hike for more than three decades would mean an extra £3.1bn of interest payments for borrowers on standard variable rate and tracker mortgages. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “For anyone who is already struggling with runaway price rises, the extra cost of the mortgage could be the final straw.” Our economics correspondent Richard Partington has the full story: After some choppy sessions recently, stocks have opened higher in New York ahead of tonight’s US interest rate decision. The S&amp;P 500 – a broad index of US companies – is 0.4% higher, up 15 points at 3,871. Investors are expecting another hefty rise in US interest rates from the Federal Reserve – quite possibly the third 75bp rise (three quarters of a percent) in a row, or even a full percentage point rise. Local councils are welcoming the six month energy price guarantee – but warning that they, too, need further help to get through the cost of living crisis. Cllr Andrew Western, chair of the resources board at the Local Government Association, says capping gas and electricity costs (at around half the expected levels this winter) is a ‘positive step’. The LGA says councils have been hit by soaring prices – pushing up the cost of running and repairing street lighting, filling potholes and building new roads Western explains: “Alongside energy bills, councils are also facing massive increases in costs due to spiralling inflation and National Living Wage increases both this year and in future years. This is forcing councils to reset budgets leading to cuts to local services just to meet their legal duty to balance the books. “Further government support will be needed by councils and residents to cope with these ongoing pressures and to protect the services that our communities rely on every day and will be vital to help residents cope through the cost-of-living crisis.” UK brewers are also concerned by the looming ‘cliff edge’ at the end of next March. Roy Allkin Chairman of the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) says the sector has suffered from soaring energy bills: Many independent brewers have been hit hard by the recent spikes in energy prices and today’s bold step will give them six months of headroom. However given the uncertainty in the energy markets, there is a danger that a cliff edge will be created next year and serious questions remain about the criteria being used to identify the most vulnerable businesses that will be eligible for further support. The debate on banker bonuses is heating up ahead of Friday’s mini-budget, with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey now under pressure to denounce plans to scrap the cap on bumper payouts. Kalyeena Makortoff, our banking correspondent explains… You’ll remember that Bailey was repeatedly criticised for suggesting workers should hold back from asking for pay rises, amid fears that it could further fuel inflation. He originally said in February: ‘We do need to see restraint in pay bargaining otherwise it will get out of control.’ But GMB union general secretary Gary Smith says Bailey risks setting a double-standard unless he takes a stance against scrapping the cap - a move which is widely expected to be confirmed on Friday. The current cap was part of post-financial crisis reforms introduced by the EU in 2016, and meant bankers were limited to bonuses worth two times their salaries. (More here for context) In a letter to Bailey, Smith says: “The Prime Minister has stated she supports plans to scrap the cap on bankers’ bonuses. To my mind, this will rightly be seen as a gratuitous insult to workers who are being told by you and others to tighten their belts.” Smith goes on to ask whether Bailey will stand by his comments about restraints in pay bargaining, adding: “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The GMB boss also reiterates his offer for Bailey to shadow a low-paid care worker, saying that: “It would also be a good opportunity for you to explain directly, if this is your view, why the Bank of England thinks there should be one rule for bankers and another for care workers.” It remains to be seen whether Bailey chooses to take on the banker bonus battle, given he’s also facing a crisis of independence, with the government threatening to introduce powers that would allow politicians to intervene in regulatory matters. The Unite union has dubbed the energy support package a taxpayer funded ‘panic measure’. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The government plans are a short term taxpayer funded panic measure. Although they will give business some respite on soaring energy bills in the short term, employers are crying out for long-term solutions in order to be able to plan with confidence for the future. “Yet again the taxpayer is being required to pick up the tab, with no check or penalty being placed on the excessive profits being generated by the energy companies who will be laughing all the way to the bank.” Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Live blog is also covering the political reaction to today’s support package – including warnings that it comes too late for some companies: The chair of parliament’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, has criticised the government for not targetting its support at businesses and organisations who most needed the help. Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, says: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” British manufacturers expect the biggest drop in production since the start of last year over the next three months, as economic storm clouds darken. The Confederation of British Industry’s regular healthcheck on the sector shows that factory bosses are increasingly pessimistic about the outlook – showing the urgent need for today’s energy support package. The difference between manufacturers who expect a rise in output over the next three months, and those who expect a fall dropped to -17% in September, from -2 in August. That’s the lowest since during the Covid lockdowns of January 2021. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said the economic outlook has deteriorated: “It is clear that the downturn, which originated in consumer-facing services, has spread to manufacturing, with output falling for the second month running. When adding an uncertain demand environment to ongoing input and labour shortages, and a cost-of-doing-business crisis, the outlook looks increasingly challenging for the sector. “If the country is going to fulfil the government’s ambitious plans to supercharge economic growth, businesses need the confidence and the capital to invest. The announcement of support on energy bills is a good first step, and the CBI looks forward to working in lockstep with the Government going forward.” Meanwhile in the City….French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone, citing opportunities to accelerate a “streamlining” of the London-listed group’s business. Niel, who founded the telecoms company Iliad, has taken the stake through his investment vehicle Atlas Investissement. My colleague Mark Sweney has the full story: The big question is whether this marks the start of further stake building and what Niel plans to do with his increasing share of the company, explains Victoria Scholar of Interactive Investor: Niel is a veteran in the telecoms industry with vast experience through his majority shareholding in Iliad, which he took private last year. Vodafone shares are trading at depressed levels, down more than 20% since the February highs, providing an attractive entry point for Niel. Since 2015, investors have had a rough ride with the stock which is down by almost 60% from the peak and losses have accelerated over the last month. Vodafone has been struggling this year with the pressures from inflation, in particular with rising energy costs. There can be no starker contrast between how the two political parties are judged on economic policy than the way the past fortnight has played out for Liz Truss, our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot writes: The astonishing scale of state spending to relieve the energy crisis and enable tax cuts has been announced with total omertà thus far on how much the proposals will cost the British taxpayer. One Labour shadow cabinet minister observed this week that they had been irritated by an interview with Rishi Sunak earlier in the leadership contest on how he would fund his own energy crisis package – costing a mere £15bn – where he had admitted at least £10bn would come from borrowing. “We’d have been crucified for that,” the shadow cabinet minister observed. “But since then we’ve had the new PM announce hundreds of billions and refused to say anything at all.” The energy package for business announced on Wednesday also has no detail on the anticipated costs of discounting wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools…. Here’s the full analysis: The cost of living crisis has prompted Marks &amp; Spencer to raise its pay rates for the second time this year. M&amp;S will lift the hourly pay rate formore than 40,000 workers to a minimum of £10.20 from October 1st, as part of a £15m package. The additional autumn pay review, a first for M&amp;S, follows an initial pay increase in April to £10/hour, from £9.50. Combined, this represents an annual raise of 7.4% – while UK inflation was 9.9% in August. M&amp;S is also giving 4,500 salaried staff on pre-management levels a one-off £250 M&amp;S voucher, and offering a free meal per shift for staff at its Distribution Centre in Castle Donington. This month, M&amp;S also introduced free sanitary products to colleagues across all stores and sites. The government will set out the cost of capping energy prices for households and businesses in Friday’s mini-budget, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Liz Truss said. Reuters has the details: The government pledged on Wednesday to cap electricity and gas costs for businesses at less than half the market rate. The finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng plans to make a fiscal statement on Friday to explain his plans to support households and businesses through the coming winter. “Costs will be set out in the expected fiscal event on Friday,” Truss’s spokeswoman told reporters. The chancellor is expected to unveil tax cuts of £30bn to £50bn, according to some estimates, while the government’s intervention to freeze energy prices for consumers and businesses could cost more than £100bn. (although, as Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out earlier, the final bill depends on the energy market). Kwarteng has also refused to let the government’s fiscal watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts: Here’s a clip of Jacob Rees-Mogg announcing today’s six-month support package via video – rather than to MPs in the House of Commons, where he’d be questioned about the details (incuding the cost!). He explains how the package will help businesses, charities, and public sector organisations including schools, nurseries, hospitals and care homes. Rees-Mogg says the package will help keep high streets ‘humming this winter, and beyond’ – although, as we flagged earlier, there’s a boarded-up shop next to the business secretary, out of shot…. Businesses have been given an emergency package of government support including a cap significantly reducing the price paid for energy from 1 October to help them get through the winter, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson explains: The UK government has stepped in to discount wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools. Under the plan, they will be given support for six months to protect them from soaring bills. Further help will be offered to companies in vulnerable industries after that. The business department has announced a “supported wholesale price” expected to be £211 a megawatt hour for electricity and £75 a MWh for gas, which it said would be less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter. The cap means that electricity prices for business customers will still be about double what they were in October 2021, when the price per megawatt hour was £117, but more than half the forecast winter prices of about £540. The scheme limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas and electricity. Businesses will not need to take any action, as the discounts will be automatically applied to their bills. The changes will apply to new contracts from 1 October, and to fixed contracts taken out since 1 April. Here’s Alex’s full story: This chart shows how the government’s price cap will protect businesses, public sector groups such as schools, and charities from the surge in electricity bills this winter: Asked about the impact on government borrowing, Jacob Rees-Mogg says the support package will reduce the interest bill on index-linked UK debt. That’s because it will lower inflation, which is used to set the repayment cost on gilts linked to the RPI measure of rising prices, he explains. [we learned this morning that interest payments on the national debt hit a record in August, due to high inflation]. Rees-Mogg agreees there will be a cost to today’s package, but argues this burden should be borne collectively on the balance sheet that can bear it. Rees-Mogg adds that today’s business support package only last for six months due to the complexity of the non-domestic energy market. Today’s package will give people confidence through the winter, he argues. The package will be reviewed in three months time to check the government is giving support in the right places, and to ensure that continued support “if that’s necessary’ is directed where it is needed, the business secretary adds. That sounds like a hint that some of the groups covered by today’s announcement, such as schools, hospitals and care homes as well as the hospitality sector, could get more support beyond next March. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the energy support package will cost ‘tens of billions’ of pounds, but can’t give a precise estimate – as it will depend on the wholesale energy market. Rees-Mogg has told Sky News that the caps on gas and electricity announced today will be a ‘huge support’ for businesses, to ensure they can cope with the rise in energy prices caused by Putin’s war in Ukraine. He adds: The difficulty with giving you a cost figure is that this will depend on where the price of energy goes over the winter, and that’s very difficult to forecast. I can’t give you an absolute cost, but we are talking about many billions of pounds. It will be into the tens of billions, unquestionably. Some businesses are looking for more support from the government – warning that the cost of living crisis could also hit takings. Paul Cook, 50, a director at the Angry Parrot pub, told PA Media that the energy cap won’t make a difference if people can’t afford to visit pubs, clubs and hospitality venues. He added: “VAT is always a killer, if we could reduce that that would be more than welcome. It’s all about cash flow for us. Any scrapping of business rates for the remainder of the year, that would be more than welcome. “This support’s only for six months, and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but what’s going to happen after those six months? Will it be enough to turn it all around? We need to make sure the public has disposable income. Cook warned that business had already deteriorated: “Trade for us has already dropped off probably by about 40% in the past month. We’re looking towards the Christmas period and hoping this could help to kickstart things, but I don’t know.” The new cap applies to businesses on existing fixed price contracts signed since April 1st, and on any new fixed contracts taken out from 1st October. Firms on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs – but that will be capped, so they could end up paying more if wholesale prices rise above the current expected levels. The early years sector also warned of the perils of a cliff edge in six months’ time and called for additional future support for nurseries which are closing “at an alarming rate”. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said: “Although capping energy costs will help give certainty over what will be a very difficult winter, it cannot lead to a cliff edge in six months’ time. “Childcare businesses – which have been closing at an alarming rate - are absolutely fundamental both for children’s development and for parental employment. Due to their importance and the risks they face, they must be classed as vulnerable, so they get additional future support.” The UK Green Building Council is urging the government to produce a strategy to cut the vast costly energy waste from the sector’s poorly insulated buildings – including through tax incentives. Shifting from gas and oil heating to more efficient, low carbon options, will also help give firms energy security. UKGBC’s Head of Policy &amp; Public Affairs, Louise Hutchins, explains: Measures such as VAT and business rates cuts for businesses investing in decarbonising their buildings and requiring companies to measure and publish their energy performance will all be needed if we are to get off the hook of high and volatile gas bills year on year. Labour have criticised the government for failing to provide help to businesses and other non-domestic users sooner, given the energy crisis has been building for months. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy, says some firms have already collapsed while waiting for support: “It is farcical that the Tories have been unable to tell businesses at the sharp end of the energy crisis what they plan to do to help them until now. Labour has been calling for support since the start of the year. “Businesses have been crying out for detail on these plans and, even now, there are still questions about how much this will cost and who will pay for it. “We have known a crisis of this scale has been coming for months and Conservative dither and delay has forced too many businesses to close, with the future still looking bleak. “While the Tories prioritise the profits of oil and gas producers, Labour will always be on the side of business and the jobs they create.” Today’s business energy support package to help firms through the winter will cost up to £25bn, the consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates. Robert Buckley, Cornwall’s head of relationship development, explains that the new caps on gas and electricity costs will mean substantial savings for non-domestic users. Effectively it takes the market back to the prices in spring this year, Buckley says (when the Ukraine war has already pushed up wholesale energy prices). “The reduction in energy costs will be substantial. As a proxy and noting the challenge of calculating a homogenous discount across so many contract types, this represents a 45% discount to closing wholesale energy prices as at the end of last week. The support effectively reverts the market back to where it was price wise in the Spring of 2022. Buckley adds: “Structuring this as fixed discounts on wholesale energy costs caps the cost of the scheme for government at around £25bn. There will also be a strong incentive for businesses to move from out of contract to negotiated contract terms, which acts to maintain the integrity of the market. This will be very important for what emerges after these six months have elapsed. The ICAEW, which represents chartered accountants, also fears a cliff-edge in six months time when the cap on non-domestic electricity and gas charges end. Businesses will need to know soon what happens when this support ends, and what to expect if there are energy shortages, warns Iain Wright, ICAEW’s managing director for reputation and influence: “Our members are playing a key role in both running companies facing increases in costs of doing business, as well as helping firms up and down the country deal with the fallout from the energy crisis but continued uncertainly makes it extremely difficult to plan. We hope the government continues to respond flexibly to provide support where needed, otherwise firms will face a cliff edge in six months’ time which can only mean price increases and real threats of company failures - feeding inflation, harming the economy and hurting consumers. The long term solution to Britain’s energy crisis include using less, says Jess Ralston, senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. With taxpayer support only set to last for six months under the current plan, the question is what happens after that? “Experts have said time and time again that the government’s approach to the gas crisis is missing a key component – conserving energy. While billions will be spent on bailing out bills, much less is targeted at the root of the problem, that we waste huge amounts of our energy.” The CBI, which represents UK businesses, is also concerned about what will happen when the package ends in six months time. Matthew Fell, CBI Chief Policy Director, says the cap on gas and electricity costs for non-domestic users announced today is ‘a substantial short-term fix to a long-term problem’. “The package will ease worries about otherwise viable businesses shutting-up shop and smaller companies especially will benefit from the discounted rate. “Businesses will also want to know more about the exit strategy and what happens when the six-month cap runs out. Working closely with business will be key to successful implementation. “The long-run solution is to double-down on energy security and to incentivise firms to push ahead with ambitious energy efficiency programmes to lower demand.” School leaders have welcomed the government’s new energy bill relief scheme, but warned that limiting it to six months would make it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially at a time when already tight budgets are under additional strain from unfunded pay awards to teachers and support staff. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said without the cap schools and colleges were facing “absolutely massive hikes” in energy costs which would have caused an immediate financial meltdown in the sector, our energy correspondent Sally Weale writes. But, Barton added, “The glaring problem is the fact that the scheme is time-limited to six months”, meaning schools cannot plan for the future with any confidence. “The government says it will review the operation of the scheme in three months’ time to inform decisions on future support after March 2023. However, this uncertainty makes it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence because they could be knocked off course at a later date by steep rises to energy bills if government support drops off. School and college budgets are incredibly tight and any financial ill-wind is potentially devastating. We will be pressing the government for a firmer commitment to the sector. Barton went on: “The other issue is the fact that pay awards for teachers and support staff have been agreed at a national level but there is no additional government funding for schools and colleges to be able to afford the cost of these awards. The pay awards are fully deserved and needed – and in fact do not go far enough – but the government’s expectation that this will be paid for out of existing budgets that are already very tight is completely unrealistic and unsustainable.” Although the government says today’s cap sets gas and electricity costs at just half the expected winter levels, the actual savings will depend when a firm signed its energy contract. BEIS have supplied an example of how the wholesale energy price cap will work for a pub which fixed its energy bill last month – when prices were surging. A pub uses 4 MWh of electricity and 16 MWh of gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in August 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £7,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWh for electricity, and £75/MWh for gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme. The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £380/MWh for electricity and £100/MWh for gas, meaning they receive a discount of £3,100 per month, reducing their bill by over 40%. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, has warned that the government must avoid a ‘cliff edge’ when today’s six-month package of help finishes at the end of March 2023. Nicholls says: “This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that Government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure. The Government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the Government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.” Many pubs had warned that they faced collapse this winter without support through the energy crisis: The Government plans to publish a review its Energy Bill Relief Scheme in three months time. That will examine whether it could be extended beyond the end of March 2023, and further targeted – or replaced with other targeted support for these most vulnerable users. A parallel support package for non-domestic users will be established in Northern Ireland, the BEIS department says (Northern Ireland has a different energy market than the rest of the UK, and isn’t covered by Ofgem’s domestic price cap). The government will also provide equivalent support to non-domestic users who use heating oil or alternative fuels instead of gas, because they aren’t connected to either the gas or electricity grid (with details to follow….). Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the government’s plans will “increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter”. Rees-Mogg explains: “We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes. “The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the Government’s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support. Worryingly, gas prices are rising this morning after Putin announced the partial mobilisation of Russian forces. The wholesale month-ahead UK gas price has risen 6% to 335p per therm – twice as much as a year ago (but only half its August peak). Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says the package will prevent companies collapsing under the weight of soaring energy bills this winter: “We have stepped in to stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs, and limit inflation. “And with our plans to boost home-grown energy supply, we will bring security to the sector, growth to the economy and secure a better deal for consumers.” Liz Truss says the new scheme will provide certainty and peace of mind to businesses, charities and public sector organisations this winter, by keeping their energy bills down. The new package is ‘equivalent’ to the support for households announced almost two weeks ago, says BEIS (although it won’t last as long). It will cap gas and electricity prices at ‘less than half’ the wholesale prices expected this winter, the department explains: To administer support, the Government has set a Supported Wholesale Price – expected to be £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas, less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter – which is a discounted price per unit of gas and electricity. This is equivalent to the wholesale element of the Energy Price Guarantee for households. It includes the removal of green levies paid by non-domestic customers who receive support under the scheme. Breaking: Gas and electricity costs for UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are to be capped – the government has announced. The BEIS department says that electricity prices are expected to be capped at £211 per megawatt hour, while gas prices will be capped at £75 per MWh –- in line with what was reported overnight. [that’s 21.1p/kWh for electricity and 7.5p/kWh for gas] Suppliers are to apply the reduction automatically to all eligible non-domestic customers, BEIS adds, with the government compensating suppliers for the cost. The savings will apply to contracts signed since April 1st this year – and run from 1st October to 31st March 2023. More details to follow…. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged the Chancellor not to pass the cost of an energy cap on to struggling families. Scotland’s Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans and Conor Murphy, Northern Ireland’s finance minister, have called for an extended and targeted support package for those worst hit by the cost-of-living crisis. In a joint letter to Kwasi Kwarteng, they say the UK government should impose a windfall tax to ensure the energy sector pays the price, “rather than passing on the cost through higher borrowing”. They say: “We are deeply concerned at who will bear the brunt of these costs. “Support should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing the cost to households through higher borrowing. “Looking ahead to your forthcoming fiscal statement, we urge you to focus efforts on those most impacted, not just relying on blanket interventions which do not recognise the scale of hardship particular households are facing. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg was spotted yesterday being filmed in Westminster – perhaps for an online video to outline today’s energy support package? Sam Coates of The Times has the details: The UK’s energy support packages for households and businesses are “something of almost a panic reaction.” That’s the verdict from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this morning. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think something like this was inevitable. Some businesses were seeing their energy bills going up by five times - or certainly that was likely to happen from October. “Just as households were going to need some protection, so were businesses. Johnson adds that the government is right to be planning more targeted support for businesses in six months time. “I rather wish they had done the same for households because for households and for businesses this is something of almost a panic reaction. “You have got to do something and the only thing that they can do immediately is protect everybody, whereas in the medium term if this goes on we really want something that is more targeted.” The prospect of a cut in UK stamp duty has pushed up shares in UK housebuilders. Persimmon (+4.6%), Barratt (+3.6%), Taylor Wimpey (+3.3%) and Berkeley (+3%) are all among the top FTSE 100 risers, as traders anticipate changes to the property sales tax. Weapons manufacturer BAE Systems has jumped almost 4.5%, as defence stocks rally after the ‘partial mobilisation’ announced by Putin this morning. Today’s public finances report shows the UK government received £7.8bn of revenue from stamp duty so far this financial year, over a third more than in April-August 2021. VAT revenues are up 12% this financial year (to £73.1bn), while PAYE income tax receipts are 10.7% higher (at £81.8bn). According to The Times, the government will announce plans to cut stamp duty in the its mini-budget this week in an attempt to drive economic growth. Liz Truss, they explain, believes that cutting stamp duty will encourage economic growth by allowing more people to move and enabling first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. But cutting stamp duty could simply allow sellers to charge more for their properties (as stamp duty is paid by the buyer), pushing up prices… Over in Germany, the government has agreed to nationalize gas importer Uniper in a historic move to prevent its energy sector collapsing. Under today’s deal, Germany will take control of Uniper, buying the 78% owned by Fortum -- which is majority owned by the Finnish government -- for about €480m. The government in Berlin will also inject €8bn into Uniper, after the Dusseldorf-based utility ran up billions of euros of losses after Russia cut off supplies to Europe. That sent Uniper scambling to find alternative gas supplies, as prices soared as European countries tried to built up storage before winter. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, dropping below last week’s weakest point. Sterling dropped below $1.131, levels last seen in 1985, before recovering a little. It’s now down over 16% against the dollar this year. The euro also weakened, while safe-haven government bonds are rallying, after Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilisation of forces in Russia, in a national address. Putin also accused the west of planning to destroy Russia and use nuclear blackmail, and said Russia would use “all means available to us”. Our liveblog on the Ukraine war has more details: Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government is right to help families and businesses, after the UK borrowed £11.8bn last month. Kwarteng said in a statement: “I have pledged to get debt down in the medium term. However, in the face of a major economic shock, it is absolutely right that the government takes action now to help families and businesses,” “Our priority is to grow the economy and improve living standards for everyone - with strong economic growth and sustainable public finances going hand in hand.” The UK borrowed nearly twice as much in August as the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted back in May, points out Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK: “Public sector borrowing came in at £11.8 billion in August, down by £2.6 billion from last year but £5.8 billion above the OBR’s forecast. This overshoot was driven by higher than expected inflation which pushed up debt interest costs, and the rollout of the first instalment of the £650 cost-of-living payment for households on means-tested benefits which began in July. A return of large-scale borrowing under Liz Truss’s government will be “a test for the bond markets”, Stelmach warns: “Since the start of the year, UK 10-year government bond yields have already risen by over 230 basis points. The expected increase in borrowing to fund the Energy Price Guarantee, coupled with a fall in the Bank of England’s gilt holdings, will be a test of whether private investors can absorb an outsized bond issuance without a further punitive increase in debt servicing costs.” Britain borrowed more than expected in August, as soaring inflation pushed up the UK deficit. Public sector borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, came in at £11.82bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports this morning. This was £2.6bn less than in August 2021 but £6.5bn more than in August 2019, before the pandemic, when the UK borrowed £5.3bn to balance the books. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted the UK would borrow £8.45bn. The deficit was pushed up by the cost of repaying existing debt. The UK spent £8.2bn on interest payments on central government debt in August. That includes £4.7bn due to the impact of rising RPI inflation (which pushed up the cost of repaying index-linked government debt). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are finally going to learn what support they will receive to help them through the energy crisis – but will it be enough? The government is expected to announce a cap on wholesale gas and electricity costs for these groups today, in the second part of its energy price guarantee to cut soaring bills. The plan, to be announced by business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to cut the rate for electricity and gas for non-domestic users by about 50% and 25% respectively, compared with current contracts. It’s likely to cost tens of billions of pounds, depending how high wholesale energy prices remain. Two weeks ago, Liz Truss promised ‘equivalent support’ for businesses and public sector organisations over the coming winter, when she announced the government would cap domestic bills at an average £2,500 a year But while those domestic cap runs for two years, the business support may only last six months for many firms. The discounts are set to apply to contracts signed since April 1 this year, and would last for six months starting from October 1, Bloomberg reported last night. That would help companies get through the winter crunch, but provide less certainty about the future. Yesterday, pub chain Fuller’s revealed its energy bill was due to more than double this year, from £8m to £18m, without government support. And business groups have warned that the UK faces a “lost generation” of traders, adding that a cap would not affect high standing charges imposed by suppliers. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Alex Lawson explain: Suppliers would be able to impose their own charges on top and would be compensated for the wholesale price cap by the government. This would be about 21p per kilowatt-hour for electricity and 7.5p per kWh for gas. There would be a different cap for those paying variable rates. Government sources said this was the most likely model and scale of energy bill support for businesses, without saying how much the total package would cost the Treasury. Craig Beaumont, the chief of external affairs at the FSB, said: “If the government is going for a fixed wholesale price, tomorrow we need to understand how that will be applied to small businesses’ energy bills in practice. A small business will need to be told by their supplier, fast, what their new bill will be. “However, there may be no regulation of the other major element of small business energy bills – the standing charge. “While consumers will have their standing charge capped, small firms won’t, and that means energy providers could continue to hike standing charges, and so still mean small businesses seeing their energy bills spiral.” We’ll also be watching the financial markets today, where investors are bracing for another hefty rise in US interest rates tonight. Economists are predicting the US Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months.

Eric Garcetti, then mayor of LA, promised everything but free kittens and unicorns, vowing the Olympics “will lift up every community in Los Angeles”. Today, five years before the Games, the freshly elected mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, is sliding into the same well-worn grooves of Olympic myth-making. Now is the time for Bass and her administration to sharpen their focus, get up to speed on hard Olympic realities, and start asking tough questions of the IOC. It’s not too late. Bass arrives with progressive bona fides. Her election is meant to herald a more just city government that is less hostile to workers and the poor, particularly the legions of those who are unhoused. Yet when it comes to the 2028 Olympics, Bass has been more of the same, essentially cloning the missteps of her predecessor. She made this clear when she selected Christopher Thompson to be her chief of staff. Before being tapped, Thompson was the head of government relations for the LA28 Olympic organizing committee. Now this “head of government relations” is part of – and indistinguishable from – the government itself. The merging of corporate, Olympic and public power has caused enough consternation that questions immediately surfaced over what role Thompson will play in regards to Olympic organization and city contracts. The Bass administration issued a clipped response, asserting that Thompson “will not participate in matters regarding the Olympics for the first year of his service”. In truth, Bass had no choice. She was merely adhering to conflict of interest rules in the Ethics Handbook for City Officials. In an age of rampant corruption in LA city government, ethical guidelines may be refreshing, but how does starting his intervention into the city’s Olympic planning in 2024 any different than starting in 2023? Not only is it somewhat arbitrary, but it also beggars belief that the chief of staff for the mayor won’t have a say in what will be the largest expenditure of City Hall resources in years. In addition, Thompson comes to this job with zero LA city hall experience. His Olympic connections are a main selling point for the job. Even more worrying are the mayor’s public statements on Olympic financing. At one mayoral debate, Bass was asked whether she could assure taxpaying Angelenos that they would not be a backstop for Olympic cost overruns. She stated unequivocally, “Absolutely I would promise taxpayers that.” Thing is, the city and state have already agreed to cover cost overruns to the tune of $270m each. And let’s be clear: academic research finds that every single Olympics since 1960 has gone over budget. In fact, the cost of the 2028 Games has already leapfrogged from an estimated $5.3bn during the bid phase to $6.9bn only two years later. And that tally doesn’t include billions in security costs. In 2020, Donald Trump sat shoulder to shoulder with LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman and pledged that the security tab would largely be covered by the federal government – in other words, US taxpayers. Angelenos may consider Paris where organizers are ramping up preparations for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Back in 2017, the International Olympic Committee made a hail-mary move, simultaneously allocating the 2024 Games to Paris and 2028 to LA. Bidders in both Paris and LA vowed their Games would sidestep the entrenched downsides of the Games such as overspending, intensified policing, and gentrification. And yet, today in Paris, Olympic costs are escalating, public transport costs are skyrocketing, and the French parliament is on the verge of passing an invasive surveillance law. So much for doing things differently. Bass would also do well to reach out to Zev Yaroslavsky, the former LA council member who oversaw the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics. In 2021, appearing on LA radio station KCRW, Yaroslavsky said of the host city contract that Los Angeles signed with the International Olympic Committee: “No private sector individual would ever have signed such a contract. And, in fact, when that contract was brought to the city, I took it … to three of the most able and competent lawyers in Los Angeles in this field and I asked them: ‘What do you think?’ And they said, ‘I would never allow my client to sign such a contract.’” He also noted, “You don’t sign a blank check to the International Olympic Committee if you are a steward of the taxpayers’ money. You just can’t do that.” Yaroslavsky is right. The IOC is not to be trusted. It is a cartel that disregards the well-founded concerns of everyday people in the host city while prioritizing its own profits. The Olympics tend to induce magical thinking in host-city public officials, and not in a good way. During one of the mayoral debates, Bass essentially pledged to eliminate homelessness by the time the LA Games rolled around, stating, “I do believe that when the Olympics comes in 2028 and I’m mayor, there won’t be encampments.” This parrots the line Garcetti took on late night television: “I’m confident that by the time the Olympics come, we can end homelessness on the streets of LA,” he said. Bass’s comments elicited guffaws from debate attendees, but there’s nothing funny about the humanitarian crisis in plain sight known as homelessness. Declaring a homelessness state of emergency was a positive first step, but hosting the Olympics will only divert precious City Hall resources away from this crucial task and into planning for an optional sports spectacle. Bass has her work cut out for her. The Olympics are already quietly affecting LA in other ways, whether it be the timetable for the gondola project in Chinatown, or the retirement plans of the city’s police chief, Michel Moore. In city after city, the Olympics rejigger urban space to the benefit of the well-connected at the expense of everyone else, and LA is no exception. At the recent unveiling of former Garcetti’s official portrait, the “LA28” logo was clearly visible in the top left corner. But Garcetti no longer runs the show. Any fallout from the LA 2028 Olympics will fall squarely on Bass’s shoulders. Under Garcetti, the Olympics brazenly short-circuited democracy. The city has already ceded too much power to the Olympic machine. Time for Mayor Bass to start yanking it back."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T18:35:12Z","webTitle":"Nuclear fusion ‘holy grail’ is not the answer to our energy prayers | Letters ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/19/nuclear-fusion-holy-grail-is-not-the-answer-to-our-energy-prayers","fields":{"bodyText":"You report on the alleged “breakthrough” on nuclear fusion, in which US researchers claim that break-even has been achieved (Breakthrough in nuclear fusion could mean ‘near-limitless energy’, 12 December). To go from break-even, where energy output is greater than total energy input, to a commercial nuclear fusion reactor could take at least 25 years. By then, the whole world could be powered by safe and clean renewable energy, primarily solar and wind. The claim by the researchers that nuclear fusion is safe and clean is incorrect. Laser fusion, particularly as a component of a fission-fusion hybrid reactor, can produce neutrons that can be used to produce the nuclear explosives plutonium-239, uranium-235 and uranium-233. It could also produce tritium, a form of heavy hydrogen, which is used to boost the explosive power of a fission explosion, making fission bombs smaller and hence more suitable for use in missile warheads. This information is available in open research literature. The US National Ignition Facility, which did the research, is part of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which has a history of involvement with nuclear weaponry. Dr Mark Diesendorf University of New South Wales • As someone who once wrote a critical report for the European parliament on fusion power back in the late 1980s, I hate to rain on Arthur Turrell’s splendid parade (The carbon-free energy of the future: this fusion breakthrough changes everything, 13 December). It is indeed good news that the US National Ignition Facility has got a “net energy gain” of 1.1 MJ from an inertial confinement fusion device using lasers. In this regard, what is really valuable is that the community can now concentrate on this type of reactor, rather than other designs like the tokamak. However, I am prepared to bet that a true fusion power station is unlikely to be running before my grandchildren turn 70. After all, it has taken 60-odd years and huge amounts of money to get this far. Dr Chris Cragg London • Arthur Turrell writes that achieving “net energy gain” has a psychological effect akin to a trumpet to the ear. Well, it might do to him but not to me. Yes, it’s a fantastic achievement for those scientists and engineers who have worked to achieve this proof on concept; well done them. But it will make not one jot of a positive difference to the challenges my children and grandchildren will face as a result of the climate crisis. We only have years to achieve the changes that are necessary to avoid social catastrophe due to what’s happening to the biosphere, and that’s assuming it’s not already too late. Even the optimists understand that it will be decades before fusion power can contribute to the grid, regardless of this achievement. Meanwhile the headlines that followed this result, Turrell’s psychological trumpet, simply serve to reassure and detract from the urgency of what needs to be done now. Dick Willis Bristol • It is great news that scientists have succeeded in getting more energy out of fusion than they put in. It brings to mind a quote from a past director of the Central Electricity Generating Board: “One day you may get more energy out of nuclear fusion than you put in, but you will never get more money out than you put in.” Martin O’Donovan Ashtead, Surrey • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As the government pursues nuclear energy with the promise of a new generation of reactors, the cost of safely cleaning up waste from previous generations of power stations is soaring. Degrading nuclear facilities are presenting increasingly hazardous and challenging problems. Ageing equipment and electrical systems at Sellafield, which is storing much of the country’s nuclear waste and is one of the most hazardous sites in the world, are increasing the risk of fire, according to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. They require increasing maintenance and present growing risk. Last October a faulty light fitting started a blaze at a Sellafield facility which led to its closure for several weeks. Analysis by Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, estimates the total bill for decommissioning the UK’s nuclear waste mountain will grow to £260bn. Thomas told a conference of international experts the cost of decommissioning Sellafield had risen from to £110bn, according to freedom of information requests. Other sites that need decommissioning are the 11 Magnox power stations, built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, and seven advanced gas-cooled reactors built from the 1960s to the 1980s, including Dungeness B, which closed last year, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire. Deterioration of one of the Magnox stations, Trawsfynydd, which shut down in 1991, is such that substantial work is needed to make it safe, according to the NDA. “Work that would then need to be undone to complete reactor dismantling,” the agency said. Thomas told the International Nuclear Risk Assessment Group similar problems are expected at other Magnox sites. The timetable for decommissioning the old nuclear power stations has been abandoned, with no new timescale yet published. The Nuclear Waste Service has said deferring decommissioning for 85 years from shutdown, which was previous policy, is not suitable for all the reactors because of their different ages and physical conditions. Decommissioning of some Magnox stations will have to be brought forward, the NWS has said. Attempts to speed up the decommissioning would only add to the growing bill, Thomas said, which he estimated had increased to £34bn. In 2005, the cost for decommissioning and disposing of the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations built in the 1950s, 70s and 90s was put at £51bn. Last year the NDA estimates rose to £131bn, and its latest annual report said £149bn was needed to pay for the clear up. But Thomas said rising costs meant the total bill was on track to reach £260bn. Part of the soaring increase is the cost of building a large underground nuclear waste dump or geological deposit facility (GDF) to safely store the 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 double decker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme. The mammoth engineering project was initially predicted to cost £11bn but the bill is now estimated to be up to £53bn because of uncertainty about where the site will be located, and the need to provide space for an unspecified amount of waste from the new generation of nuclear reactors which the government wants to build. Four areas of the country are being considered for the GDF but no decision on where it will be located has yet been made. “While we are clear about the current legacy of waste which already exists, a GDF would have to handle additional waste from new facilities being developed,” the NWService said. “The actual cost will … depend on the number of new nuclear projects that the UK develops in future and any additional waste from those stations.” The cleanup of past nuclear waste will take more than 100 years, the NDA has said. Highlighting the challenges of the degrading and hazardous facilities, the authority said in its annual report that robots and drones were increasingly being used to carry out site inspections. • This article was amended on 28 September 2022.

In an unprecedented letter to Joe Biden and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the officials called for moves to stop a regional drift towards normalisation with Assad and impose a formalised ceasefire that facilitates a more impactful aid effort and helps ignite a political process. The appeal follows moves by the UAE to normalise relations with Assad, which are likely to be followed by other Arab states. Saudi Arabia on Friday flagged that it may follow suit, after a highly public state visit by the Syrian leader to Abu Dhabi earlier this month in which a 21-gun salute and a motorcade appeared to herald his official reappearance on an Arab stage, after being treated as an outcast for nearly 12 years. Signatories to the letter include a former CIA director, John McLaughlin, the most senior US official to work on Syria since 2011; James Jeffrey, a former US special envoy for Syria; retired Mne Corp General Anthony Zinni; and Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force – as well as civil society activists at the forefront of efforts to highlight crimes against humanity committed by the Assad regime. The regional moves to re-engage Assad have sparked alarm in parts of the Biden administration and in Europe, where steps are under way to prosecute low-level regime officials for war crimes. Investigators have been gathering material that could place more senior officials in the crosshairs of international prosecutors. Of particular concern is how to stabilise areas that remain outside the control of the central government, which are heavily dependent on aid, susceptible to local power bases and at the whim of neighbouring states. Assad has been unwilling to meaningfully reconcile with such areas, primarily in northern Syria. “None of the issues that caused the Syria conflict have been resolved, most notably Assad regime atrocities and inability or refusal to reform,” the letter says. “Many of the conflict’s symptoms are worsening, from human suffering, industrial-scale drug trafficking, refugee flows, terrorism, geopolitical conflict and ethnic and sectarian hostilities. “The Biden administration’s foreign policy priorities of great power competition, international and Middle East stability, human rights, humanitarianism, or combating food insecurity are insufficiently advanced through the current Syria policy. “Piecemeal normalisation efforts by some regional governments do not address US national security interests or human rights issues, and they erode the international community’s capacity to shape a political process aimed at meaningfully resolving the crisis.” The letter calls for a ceasefire to be formalised as a first step, and guaranteed by “external stakeholders”. Such a move would almost certainly require the input of a US administration that has disengaged from the Middle East and is focusing much of its foreign policy energies on Ukraine. Charles Lister, director of the Syria and countering terrorism and extremism programmes at the Middle East Institute, said: “For regional states re-engaging Assad’s regime, the calculus is driven by a simple fact: the US and allies are nowhere to be seen. Their Syria policy is impotent and indifferent, and with that, the regime is not only going nowhere, it’s being granted an unchallenged victory. “If we create a vacuum, someone’s going to step into it; if we show no serious interest in pushing determinedly for justice and accountability, why should regional states?” Meanwhile, regional moves to engage Assad are accelerating. “The logic behind it all has to do with the new realisation that the Syrian regime is here to stay,” said Prof Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a prominent UAE scholar. “The UAE tried everything possible, militarily, diplomatically, economically, over the past 10 years to help the Syrians topple this regime. “Reality on the ground says we need to engage him. Short of dismantling him, real politics requires that you talk and re-engage. This is a fundamental departure from the past. We all know that he is not a good person, that he has killed many of his people, that he has committed war crimes and did so many outrageous things and probably still does. But morality is something and politics is something else.” He added: “This is also part of the policy of reaching out to adversaries over the last 10 years. Turkey, Iran, Qatar, Israel and Syria fall into that. They are asking him to be receptive to a few more possible outcomes. Caring for the nearly 12 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, for example. More Arab presence probably will transfer in to less Iranian presence. Not total Syrian disengagement to Iran, that’s not feasible. But more Arab presence in Damascus will likely translate into less Iranian presence. “I know we differ with our American and European friends on this. We have our own way of thinking. This is an Arab case. But I think they will eventually realise the realities on the ground. Bulldozers sometimes take the brunt and the criticism, but that’s the role the UAE is playing these days.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-23T11:06:41Z","webTitle":"Call to cut UK subsidies as Drax power station profits nearly double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers are under pressure to cut subsidies to the operator of Britain’s biggest power station after it reported an 84% increase in annual profits, helped by high electricity prices. Drax, the power generator that owns the eponymous plant in North Yorkshire, posted underlying profits of £731m for 2022, up from £398m a year earlier. The company also increased its dividend by 11.7% to 21p a share – an £84m payout to shareholders. Drax, which has faced criticism over its use of biomass, has benefited from soaring power prices over the past year. Electricity prices are linked to wholesale gas costs, which have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Will Gardiner, the chief executive, said: “Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.” Drax, which supplies up to 6% of the UK’s electricity, and is seen as a source of when weather conditions preclude significant wind and solar power generation. Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing, arguing its biomass operations, which burn wood pellets to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Most of the wood is imported from North America. The former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called its business model “not sustainable”. Drax was the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation over alleged forest destruction and has also been accused of “environmental racism”. The power company said it had earned £837m in subsidies in 2020 and £885m in 2021. The level of support fell to £617m in 2022 as electricity prices exceed an agreed “strike price” agreed to encourage renewable investment. This meant Drax paid out £33m to the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a government-owned firm, compared with receiving £231m under the same mechanism a year earlier. However, it still received £650m under an older renewable energy scheme. The thinktank Ember has estimated that, from 2012 until 2027, when the support runs out, Drax would have collected more than £11bn in subsidies. The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government pays significant sums in renewable energy subsidies to bioenergy companies making sizeable profits, despite it releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and harming forests’ ability to absorb carbon. “This directly costs bill payers and families through their energy bills. In the context of the cost of living crisis, the government should be looking into these subsidies and ensuring they are used for proven renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, rather than harming nature.” Sally-Ann Hart, a Conservative MP, said: “Burning imported wood pellets for electricity is not cheap for bill payers. Given the growing environmental concerns, ministers shouldn’t commit to new subsidies for this energy source. “We should prioritise investment in clean and cheap energy sources that keep the lights on and bills low while tackling climate change, not an industry which risks fuelling deforestation.” Research by the Cut Carbon Not Forests coalition found that 62% of 2,005 UK adults surveyed thought it was wrong for the government to hand the bioenergy generator large subsidies, particularly during a cost of living crisis. The SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: “It’s clear that the British public aren’t falling for the myth that biomass is carbon neutral, no matter how many greenwashing PR stunts companies like Drax pull to convince people otherwise.” Drax is the latest UK energy firm to report a sharp rise in profits, after BP, Shell and the British Gas owner, Centrica. Their gains led to renewed calls for tougher windfall taxes. Some of Drax’s operations are covered by the electricity generator levy introduced this year but the company said recognition in the construction of the tax that biomass costs were higher than those of windfarms meant the levy “should not have an adverse impact on biomass generation”. Separately, more than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, have begun a series of strikes that will run through February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal. The company also agreed to extend the life of two coal units through the winter after a government request, amid fears over power cuts. The units have not been called into action but Drax said on Thursday that they “delivered income during the final quarter of 2022”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/02/north-korea-recent-drills-show-west-cannot-ignore-nuclear-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T19:50:03Z","webTitle":"North Korea’s recent drills show west cannot ignore nuclear threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/north-korea-recent-drills-show-west-cannot-ignore-nuclear-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/02/north-korea-recent-drills-show-west-cannot-ignore-nuclear-threat","fields":{"bodyText":"In an overcrowded diplomatic nuclear space, the last thing the west needed to hear was that North Korea was back in business. It fired 25 missiles of various kinds on Wednesday – including one that landed close to South Korea’s waters, in what President Yoon Suk-yeol said was effectively “a territorial invasion by a missile”. It was the first time since the 1945 division of the peninsula that North Korea weapons had landed so close to South Korea, 26km beyond the northern limit line. With the New York Times reporting that US intelligence had picked up Russian military chatter about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, and the talks to prevent Iran building a nuclear bomb at a total impasse, a third nuclear front just adds to the sense of a world on the brink. The possibility, now confirmed by Washington, that North Korea is also providing missiles to the depleted Russian forces in Ukraine only adds to the sense it will be hard to continue to park North Korea in the overflowing pending tray. North Korea insists there is a rational logic to its actions, saying it was responding to Washington and Seoul mounting Vigilant Storm, the largest joint military drills in its history. These exercises, designed to deter North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, involve 240 warplanes – including advanced F-35 stealth fighters – conducting about 1,600 sorties. The large-scale drills began on Monday and will run until Friday. It now seems likely that North Korea will test a nuclear bomb for the first time since 2017, prompting some to argue that it is time for the US to recognise that North Korea is a nuclear weapons state. North Korea lives in fear of an invasion, and it is not as if Kim Jong-un has hidden how he plans to prevent one. Last year he set out a five-year plan, explaining all new weapons that North Korea planned to develop. This included smaller battlefield nuclear bombs and the short-range missiles to carry them. The recent round of tests and drills shows he is earnest in his intent, and there is nothing internal or external that is going to make him change his plans. Analysts of North Korea, one of the most opaque countries in the authoritarian world, often disagree whether the leadership’s nuclear ambitions are driven by internal or external factors. One argument is that Kim’s ultimate goal is to create a crisis he can offer to defuse in return for concessions on sanctions or trade deals. The other school says this underplays the extent to which North Korea’s leaders are driven by fear of domestic economic failure. The Peterson Institute of International Economics on 28 September reported that North Korea was locked in the worst crisis of food insecurity since the great famines of the mid-1990s and concluded that in the most recent harvest cycle, a mixture of inadequate water and Covid restrictions meant North Korea had “probably fallen below the level of minimum human needs”, partly due to rises in the price of grain. Whatever the motive, it leaves Yoon’s “audacious plan” unveiled on 15 August, setting out the benefits North Korea would receive in return for a denuclearisation programme, looks even more of a dead letter. There had been high hopes for the plan: to distinguish it from previous incarnations, the Yoon government had indicated that South Korea could offer food aid in the early stage if North Korea returned to the denuclearisation talks even before it took concrete steps. The immediate US backing for South Korea’s plan added another incentive, raising the hope that some kind of partial sanction relief could be possible for North Korea. But the plan was rejected by Pyongyang on the grounds that it was largely a recycling of previous offers that would have denuded the country of its security. No-one would trade away their destiny for corn cake, Kim Jong-un’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, decreed. So Washington is waiting to see if North Korea will revive its nuclear test programme, and has only limited options if it does. The IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said last week: “Everybody is holding its breath about this, because another nuclear test would be yet another confirmation of a programme which is moving full steam ahead, in a way that is incredibly, incredibly concerning, Further tests, of course, means that they are refining the preparations and the construction of their arsenal.” So the world now faces the prospect of one rogue state in Asia, and another theocratic state in the Middle East coming closer to possessing a nuclear bomb than ever before, and at the same time a cornered nuclear superpower actually threatening to puts its arsenal to use. It is not the best backdrop for Joe Biden’s run-in to the midterm elections."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-11T19:00:03Z","webTitle":"Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/12/prescribing-nature-the-restorative-power-of-a-simple-dose-of-outdoors","fields":{"bodyText":"In my mid-20s, I undertook the quintessentially Australian rite of passage of moving to London for a few years. Months into my first English winter, I started having dreams about the Australian wilderness. The images were so vivid and specific that I jotted them down. I had a recurring dream about looking at the sea from a high vantage point, somewhere along the south-east Queensland coast that I had always taken for granted. There was “all manner of ocean life”, I noted: dolphins jumping in the shallows; two whales, a mother and calf, out in deeper water. “Got really excited about seeing my first wild platypus,” I wrote about another dream, still never having spotted one in real life. I had never considered myself a particularly outdoorsy person, but London’s occasional urban grimness had triggered a nostalgia for the natural environment of my childhood. When I returned home, it was with a newfound appreciation for the soft evening chirp of cicadas, the fine sand that sticks to everything and the mist of humpbacks on the horizon. As the pandemic has highlighted, I am not alone in desiring more time in nature when access to it is limited. The restorative effects of spending time in green spaces, it turns out, may be essential for our health and wellbeing. “Research shows that over time we’ve become more disconnected as humans from nature,” Prof Thomas Astell-Burt, a population health expert at the University of Wollongong, tells me. A 2017 study, for example, found that pop culture references to nature – in fiction, song lyrics and film storylines – have declined since the 1950s. “It might reflect that we as a society have become much more inward focused on our urban consumerist lifestyles,” Astell-Burt says. As early as the 1990s, researchers found that going for a walk in a natural environment as opposed to an urban landscape brought about improvements in people’s ability to concentrate, feelings of wellbeing and even in blood pressure, he says. Being in nature, studies tell us, has significant positive effects on our mental and physical health. Living close to green or blue spaces – rural or coastal environments – has been linked time and time again to reductions in the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Access to green space has also been linked to a reduced risk of loneliness and some have even suggested that interacting with microbes in the environment may be beneficial for our immune systems. Overseas, the link between spending time in nature and wellbeing has led to the rise of nature-based prescription programs, sometimes described as “green prescriptions” or “blue prescriptions”. In 2020, the UK government announced £4m for a two-year green prescription pilot in four areas that had been hard hit by Covid. Since the beginning of 2022, doctors in several Canadian provinces have been able to prescribe time in nature to their patients, including a pass that gives access to the country’s national parks. In Japan, health practitioners have recommended shinrin-yoku – forest bathing, a practice that involves connecting with nature through the senses – since 1982. In Australia, nature prescribing is not yet commonplace, despite a growing body of research pointing to both potential benefits and local interest. Studies of nearly 47,000 Australians have found that in urban areas, a threshold of at least 30% green space or tree canopy is associated with health benefits, including lower odds of diabetes and psychological distress. “We really have enough local evidence to show that’s how much we need for Australia,” says Prof Xiaoqi Feng from the University of New South Wales school of population health. “In all our research papers we control for competing socioeconomic explanations like income and education and still find evidence that green space benefits mental and physical health.” In 2021, an eight-week nature prescription trial run by Green Adelaide found that participants who completed the program reported improved general wellbeing and connectedness to nature. The trial, however, only included six participants. A national survey Astell-Burt and Feng conducted during the pandemic found that 82% of Australian adults would be interested in receiving a nature prescription and that appetite was still high (76%) among those who were spending the least amount of time – less than two hours a week – in nature. “There is no national or even state nature prescription program to which health professionals could refer these individuals or any sort of consistent guidelines that health professionals could follow in Australia,” Astell-Burt says. “We need to run high-quality randomised trials which show definitively what types of nature prescriptions work where, when and for whom. We can’t assume there’ll be a one-size-fits-all solution.” Though research into the positive effects of blue spaces – time near oceans, lakes or rivers – is still emerging, Astell-Burt suggests their benefits would be broadly comparable. Dr Rowena Ivers, a general practitioner in Wollongong, has been recommending time in nature to some of her patients. “Most of it now is having a conversation with people. With people with chronic disease, we might write it into a chronic disease care plan.” Some of the recommendations might be paired with exercise, such as bushwalking or participating in parkruns, or with civic engagement, such as working in a community garden or on bush regeneration projects. “There’s a whole range of ways that it can be done depending on what the person enjoys,” Ivers says. “GPs have a growing awareness of social prescribing … but we know that beyond that, activities that are in nature have extra benefits.” Experts suggest that spending time in nature may not have the same barrier to uptake as exercise, which people might dread or avoid despite knowledge of its benefits. The upside of a nature prescription is not having to work up the motivation to, say, tackle a big run in the park, Feng says. “You could just relax there, listen to birdsong, be with your friends [or] even just have a small urban garden on your balcony.” While “it’s not a silver bullet”, Feng suggests that nature prescriptions could be integrated into the health system as part of routine care. “[It] could have multiple benefits for people’s mental, social and physical health and probably cost little to the individual and the health system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T14:09:34Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 397 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-397-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the partially occupied region of Zaporizhzhia, where he meet with UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi. The head of the UN’s nuclear agency said they had “a rich exchange on the protection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant”. In a message on Telegram, Ukraine’s president said “I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said. Zelenskiy posted to his official Telegram that“Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reported, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. Zelenskiy on Sunday urged all Ukrainians to remain engaged with developments in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. “Now, just as it was a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, real hostilities are taking place geographically far from many,” said the Ukrainian president in his nightly address. Heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said Sunday in a televised interview broadcast. Putin said the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/mar/25/nsw-election-australia-news-live-updates-premier-dominic-perrottet-2023-new-south-wales-polls-votes-labor-chris-minns-results-winner-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-25T12:56:25Z","webTitle":"Chris Minns celebrates historic victory as Labor returns to power – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/25/nsw-election-australia-news-live-updates-premier-dominic-perrottet-2023-new-south-wales-polls-votes-labor-chris-minns-results-winner-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/mar/25/nsw-election-australia-news-live-updates-premier-dominic-perrottet-2023-new-south-wales-polls-votes-labor-chris-minns-results-winner-latest-news","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor leader Chris Minns will be New South Wales’ next premier, delivering a victory speech to a jubilant crowd of Labor supporters at the party’s election nigh function in Sydney where he was welcomed by prime minister Anthony Albanese. While that’s the headline, the count is not yet done. Here’s a summary of what we know just before midnight: Labor are on track to form a majority government, with results in a few key seats still unclear late on Saturday as counting ended for the night. Various vote counts have Labor hovering at the 47 seats needed for majority government. Dominic Perrottet will stand down as New South Wales Liberal leader, he announced in a concession speech in which he said he feels a “profound sense of gratitude” to have led the state. Former treasurer Matt Kean, when asked if he was interested in the leadership, said it was too early to say. Both Perrottet and Minns heaped praise on each other for waging a fair campaign. The Coalition have lost a slew of seats, including many once considered safe Liberal seats. Wakehurst, held by retiring health minister Brad Hazzard, has been won by independent Michael Regan. Liberal MP Stuart Ayres appears to have lost his seat of Penrith to Labor, as many other Liberal-held western Sydney seats fell to Labor. The outcome in several key seats is still unclear. Willoughby is on a knife-edge, with independent challenger Larissa Penn ever so slightly leading Liberal MP Tim James. Independent challenger in Wollondilly Judy Hannan is also the (slight) favourite over Liberal MP Nathaniel Smith. With that, we’ll wrap up our live election blog for the night. You can read more of our coverage from today here. Premier-elect Chris Minns’ victory speech: ‘Back and ready’: Chris Minns leads Labor to power after 12 years in opposition at historic 2023 NSW election Labor is on track to form majority government in New South Wales after 12 years in opposition, with the party leader, 43-year-old former firefighter and political staffer Chris Minns, declaring the party is “back and ready to govern in this great state”. As counting ended on Saturday night, Labor had picked up at least nine seats, enough to govern in majority and a better-than-expected result for the party after big swings in many previously safe Coalition seats. The result means Minns will become the first Labor leader to win government from opposition in NSW for almost three decades and sees the Coalition relegated to the opposition benches in every parliament on mainland Australia. Read more from Michael McGowan and Tamsin Rose: Northern beaches seat of Wakehurst falls to independent, but Liberals hold on in Manly and Lane Cove The independent mayor of Northern Beaches council, Michael Regan, has romped to victory in the New South Wales state seat of Wakehurst, snatching the previously blue-ribbon Liberal seat held by the retiring health minister, Brad Hazzard, with a 27.5% swing. Regan won with a decisive 56% of the two-party preferred vote, ending decades of Liberal dominance in the region. The win means that independents now represent the northern beaches at federal, state and local level. The strong showing by independents on the northern beaches will raise questions for the Liberal party, which selected candidates late and chose men who had worked for the party. Read more on how independents fared this election: Victoria’s premier Daniel Andrews has congratulated Chris Minns on his victory. Labor’s victory in NSW means there is a Labor government in power across every mainland state and territory. (Tasmania’s government is Liberal) If he forms a majority, Minns will be just the third to achieve it from opposition since Bill McKell in 1941. Neville Wran and Bob Carr are the only others to have done it, in 1976 and 1995 respectively. Less certainty around close seats A number of seats that various TV networks were eager to call early now appear far less certain, as the count broadly progresses to 50%-60% of the vote. The ABC is now projecting Labor to win Holsworthy by just 0.6%. Labor is now projected to win Kiama by 1.8% – held by ex-Liberal turned independent Gareth Ward. In Wollondilly, the ABC is projecting independent Judy Hannan will win by a margin of 0.7%. Independent Larissa Penn’s projected lead in Willoughby has also shrunk. The ABC are projecting her as 0.2% ahead of Liberal Tim James. Watch Dominic Perrottet’s concession speech here: Minns says Labor win ‘a vote against privatisation’ Premier elect Chris Minns has said Labor’s victory in the New South Wales election was at least in part fought over privatisation. It’s undeniably the case that today’s election was also a decisive vote against privatisation. To retain Sydney Water and Essential Energy in New South Wales Government. In the final weeks of the campaign, Labor ramped up its messaging about the Coalition’s history of and plans for privatisation of state assets. Minns also thanks various Labor party figures and advisers, as well as the union movement – which drew a noticeable round of applause from the crowd of supporters. Minns ends by thanking his family. After 12 years in opposition, I want to say to the people who voted for Labor or voted for the Liberals and Nationals or voted for independents or minor party candidates today. We’ve been elected by the people of this state but we will govern for everyone in NSW. We know that the challenges are huge. We know the responsibilities are awesome, but NSW Labor is back and ready to govern in this great state. Thank you. “Friends after 12 years in opposition the people of New South Wales have voted for a fresh start,” he says, thanking the Labor party faithful in the crowd. Minns thanks volunteers who helped his campaign to retain his own seat of Kogarah, which was a concern going into the election. I thought it was going to be close but in the end we got there. Minns then thanks outgoing premier, Dominic Perrottet, for his service to NSW. I would like to say thank you to the premier for his service on behalf of the people of NSW. He echoes Perrottet’s reflection of the NSW campaign. It’s undeniably the case that this election campaign perhaps uniquely was a model of respect and civility and neither party took the low road. Neither political party took the low blow. And I think it can be a model for the way democracy is done right across this country. Now, I can’t say that every election campaign in the future will be conducted the same way. But from now on, no one will be able to say that it can’t be. Minns walks to stage amid cheers of ‘Labor! Labor!’ Premier-elect Chris Minns, walking with his wife and three sons, is making his way through a crowd of elated supporters at Labor’s election night function, as he takes to the stage to claim victory in the New South Wales election. Those in the crowd are chanting “Labor, Labor”. As he walks onto the stage, Anthony Albanese takes Minns’ hand and lifts it in the air. PM warms up the Labor crowd for premier-elect Anthony Albanese has taken the stage at Labor’s election night function to welcome on Chris Minns. The crowd applauded the prime minister as he walked onto the stage, but he said “tonight is someone else’s night”. “Friends tonight the people of New South Wales have come together to choose a better future.” “I have had the very good fortune of knowing Chris for many, many years And what I know, without doubt, is that he embodies all that is best about the Australian Labor party.” Just unpacking a bit more of Dominic Perrottet’s speech: He said Liberal MP Stuart Ayres “can hold his head very high”, as the Penrith MP stares down a loss to Labor. The ABC is projecting he will lose the seat, but when speaking to Sky News earlier, Ayres was yet to concede. During Perrottet’s concession speech a few minutes ago, the outgoing premier said: It doesn’t appear that Stuart (Ayres) will have the result that he wanted, or that I wanted this evening in Penrith. But Stuart can hold his head very high. He’s served his community of Penrith incredibly well and he served our state with distinction. Immediately after Dominic Perrottet finishes speaking, the ABC panel asks Matt Kean if he will run for Liberal leadership. Kean again says it is too early to say. Dominic Perrottet has announced he will step down as Liberal leader, claiming the party needs a “fresh start”. As Perrottet announced this during his concession speech, the crowd at Liberal gathering jeered. “To everyone in the Liberal party, I’d say this next period of time will not be easy, but it will be necessary. It is a time to reflect. It is a time to rethink and ultimately to renew. To renew as leader of the parliamentary Liberal party, I take full responsibility for the loss this evening. And as a result, I will be standing down as the parliamentary leader (jeers) of the Liberal party. It’s very clear we need a fresh start for the Liberal party.” Dominic Perrottet feels a “profound sense of gratitude” to have led New South Wales Now friends, it goes without saying. I think we all wanted to have a different result this evening. But we as a party, we as a government should be very proud of what we have achieved together. I feel a profound sense of gratitude to have been able to serve the people of New South Wales. Make no mistake, we’ve made history of being in government for the longest time since our party was formed. And our government has achieved so much in so many ways. We’ve kept NSW strong, free and fair. Perrottet said NSW is a “much better place today than it was 12 years ago” and that the Coalition’s legacy will be one “of infrastructure, of investment and of imagination”. He names the metro projects in Sydney, as well as more controversial motorways, museums and stadiums, as important elements of the Coalition’s legacy in government. Outgoing premier asks for support for incoming opponent Outgoing premier Dominic Perrottet has asked New South Wales residents, regardless of political leaning, to “get behind” Chris Minns as premier. I truly believe and have no doubt that he will make a fine 47th premier of New South Wales because I believe that he will lead with the same decency and the same integrity that he has led with so far. Ultimately I ask everybody across NSW, whatever your political persuasion, to get behind him, to get behind him, because where NSW goes well, our country goes well, and that is something that is something tonight, I believe, we can all unite behind. The Liberal leader has arrived at the Liberal’s election night function and is delivering his concession piece. “A short while ago, I called Chris Minns to congratulate him and the Labor party on their election victory,” he said to a mixed reception form the Liberal faithful. “The great people of New South Wales tonight have decided to elect a Labor government in the state. And that is a decision that we respect. I particularly tonight want to acknowledge the leader of the opposition. Elections can get ugly, but I believe this election truly was a race to the top. “A genuine battle of ideas. And that’s when politics is at its best.” The former PM is now at the Liberal’s election night party in Sydney’s CBD – where the mood is grim. Howard arrived at the Liberal event at 9.40pm and walked into the ballroom with his wife Janette and Liberal minister Alister Henskens as Thunderstruck by AC/DC was played. Howard praised Dominic Perrottet’s policies and campaign. “He put forward ideas. He was bold. I particularly admired his stance on poker machines. They are a social evil in this country and I think his stance on that was admirable.” Asked if Perrottet stayed true to conservative values, Howard said: “I think Dom, he got the balance right.” Howard also had some pleasant words for both Perrottet and Labor leader Chris Minns: “The other thing I want to say is I pay tribute to the civil the campaign was conducted by both leaders.” Ayres not conceding Penrith Liberal MP Stuart Ayres is on Sky News now and is not conceding his seat just yet, despite projections Labor has won the seat. Labor MPs dividing up ministries At least one Labor MP is already talking about her colleagues’ portfolios with the party set to form government in NSW. As cheers erupted at ALP headquarters in Sydney on Saturday night, Penny Sharpe confirmed she would be environment minister, Daniel Mookhey would be treasurer and transport would go to Jo Haylen, reports AAP’s Luke Costin. No surprises here – these are the shadow portfolios each of them has held in opposition so they’ll be well versed on their new ministries. Outgoing premier on his way to Liberal party event Dominic Perrottet has just left his home in Sydney’s Hills district and is headed toward the Liberal party’s election night function in the CBD. TV cameras captured Perrottet being driven out of his home a few moments ago. It is a 25 minute drive to the Liberal party function. Terrigal is going down as a Labor gain The Central Coast seat was held by the Liberals’s Adam Crouch on a margin of 12.3%. Crouch has held the seat for three terms. It was considered a Liberal stronghold. Tonight, Labor’s Sam Boughton is projected to win the seat with a 1.5% margin, according to the ABC. No MPs at Liberal function There were still no Liberal MPs present at the party’s major function at the Sydney Hilton at 9PM. The TVs were cut and music turned on shortly after the election was called for a Labor majority. About 100 people were at the event at 9PM after the Liberals had planned to host about 300 of the party faithful. My colleague Michael McGowan, who is at Labor HQ tonight, tells me Dominic Perrottet has called Labor leader Chris Minns to concede. Willoughby appears to be inching towards independent Larissa Penn The ABC is projecting Penn to be ahead of Liberal member Tim James by 1.1%, with about 50% of the vote counted. The ABC is projecting that Penn is “likely” to win the seat, but it’s still one of the seats it considers in doubt. Willoughby had been a safe Liberal seat, held by former premier Gladys Berejiklian. The seat became marginal at the 2022 byelection after her resignation, with James scraping through with a margin of 3.3% over Penn. Prue Car says Labor ‘executed a really good campaign’ Labor’s deputy leader, Prue Car, and now also the incoming New South Wales deputy premier, has told media at the party’s increasingly raucous event in Brighton-Le-Sand that the result tonight proves the party “executed a really good campaign about the issues people are concerned about”. Labor has faced some criticism for running a small-target campaign based on key issues such as privatisation and cost-of-living, but Car said the result “shows that we were listening to people and campaigning on the issues concerning them”. She said: There is a reason that at the Sky News people’s forum [in Penrith] most of the questions to both the premier and Chris Minns were about issues we were talking about.” It feels like it’s a really hopeful night for us and that we’re seeing some really great results. A lot of seats that we needed to win. But we don’t take anything for granted and we still have a lot of seats that are close where there is a lot more to count. It’s clear that the people of NSW have voted for change.” Car, the MP in Londonderry in Sydney’s outer west, said that she was particularly interested in the result in Penrith, where Labor is ahead of Liberal MP Stuart Ayres. I cannot overstate how many resources we’ve thrown at the Liberal Party and Stuart Ayres in Penrith. Wollondilly independent ‘pretty sure’ of victory Independent candidate Judy Hannan is confident she will win Wollondilly and has begun celebrating at the Picton Bowling Club with supporters. She told Guardian Australia there were 40 volunteers already there and more would join soon. She said: We’ve had a look at all the numbers and it’s looking pretty sure. This is huge. It’s a huge swing [and] it’s because nothing got done and it was taken for granted as a safe seat.” The seat was won by Liberal Nathaniel Smith in 2019 with a 5.5% margin after Hannan cut it from 17.3%. Premier-elect Chris Minns on way to ALP function Labor leader Chris Minns has just left his house in southern Sydney and is on his way to Labor’s election night function. Minns didn’t answer questions from journalists as he walked with advisers from his house into a waiting car. Channel Seven is pursuing Minns’ car and broadcasting live vision. The ABC election analyst says he is now “confident” the ALP will be able to form government in their own right. Outgoing minister laments loss of ‘broad church’ Liberal party Over on channel Seven retiring Liberal MP David Elliott is still reminiscing about the John Howard era of his party. Elliott is saying the Liberal party will now need to work out if it wants to be “a western Sydney party” or a “north shore party”, lamenting it had strayed from being the “broad church” it had been in the Howard era. Liberal heavyweight Stuart Ayres is on track to lose his seat of Penrith. Labor’s Karen McKeown is projected to win that. Ayres has held the seat since 2010. Willoughby on knife-edge The seat of Willoughby on Sydney’s lower north shore too close to call. Willoughby had been a safe Liberal party seat, held by former premier Gladys Berejiklian. The seat became marginal at the byelection after her resignation, with Liberal Tim James scraping through with a margin of 3.3% over independent Larissa Penn. Tonight, James and Penn are neck and neck. The ABC has Penn ahead by 0.8%, with about 30% of the vote counted. Postal votes will be significant this election (about 30% of people voted early this election), and postal votes tend to skew conservative. Here’s what we know so far from counting to 8:30PM, with more than 27% of the vote counted: Labor will form government but it’s not yet clear if that will be a majority or a minority government, according to the ABC’s Antony Green. As of 8:30PM, he said it’s looking more like it will be a Labor majority government. Independents have likely gained some seats off the Coalition. In Wakehurst, independent Michael Regan looks to have won the seat from the Liberals, which was held by retiring health minister Brad Hazzard. Wollondilly looks set to be taken by independent Judy Hannan. Labor appears to have gained Monaro from the Nationals and Penrith from the Liberals. Labor will also gain Holsworthy, East Hills, Ryde and South Coast. Update from Tamsin Rose at the Liberal party function: The sound was cut on the large TV screens shortly after the election was called for Labor. The Liberal party is claiming to have retained the teal targets of Vaucluse and North Shore. They have conceded South Coast and Parramatta. Wollondilly will be won by independent Judy Hannan, the ABC are projecting. The seat was held by the Liberals. ‘People picked out of nowhere’: David Elliott savages Liberals’ candidates Retiring Liberal frontbencher David Elliott, on channel Seven’s coverage, was asked what he thought about the prospect of Matt Kean taking over the Liberal leadership from Dominic Perrottet. Elliott said: “It’s no secret that I’ve got a different flavour of liberalism than Matt Kean.” Elliott said the party needed to understand if it had lost key seats by pursuing policies to appeal to potential teal voters. Instead, Elliott said the Liberal party should pursue “positions on issues on what the centre-right, conservative battlers” want. Elliott was also scathing of the quality of candidates preselected this election. “We have people picked out of nowhere for these election campaigns.” “The probity checks just aren’t there.” “That stuff wouldn’t have happened under John Howard.” Antony Green has now called Wakehurst for Michael Regan However, retiring Liberal MP Brad Hazzard all but conceded at 7.45pm saying he would have liked to hand over the seat (past tense). The mood at the Cromer Sports club is jubilant. Regan’s people wear Maroon, not teal, but many of the same environmental and development issues have played out. They are also sick of having road projects postponed, while the bus services seem to have gone downhill, in a region that has no other public transport options. Slew of seats fall to ALP from Coalition: Antony Green ABC election analyst Antony Green says Labor has won the seats of East Hills, Monaro, Penrith, Ryde and South Coast off the Coalition. Update from Tamsin Rose at the Liberal function Not an MP in sight. As at 8PM, with about 17% of the vote counted, the ABC has called: Labor: 39 Coalition: 27 Greens: 2 Others: 6 Labor needs 47 seats to form a majority government. ABC election analyst Antony Green has already said Labor will form government, but is not yet sure if that will be a majority or minority government. Huge swings point to a likely majority government for Labor While Antony Green isn’t ready to call a majority Labor government, we’re seeing the kind of swings that will lead there. The ABC calling the electorate of South Coast - which the Coalition held on a 10.6% margin - with a swing of 16.% so far, suggests as much. As does Parramatta (held on a 6.5% margin) and Monaro (11.6%). Those regional seats are particularly significant because they were held on margins well above the uniform swing Labor needs to govern in its own right. Meanwhile treasurer Matt Kean says on ABC that he would “be happy” for Dominic Perrottet to stay on as leader in opposition “if he wanted to”. Treasurer Matt Kean begins Coalition post mortem On the ABC’s election panel, having heard Antony Green’s prediction, Kean said: “It’s very hard to see a pathway to government for the Coalition.” “It looks headed towards a Labor majority based on those numbers that we’ve just seen. But let’s see what happens.” “There are a number of challenges that we needed to work through. “We really needed everything to go our way… it’s just not.” “We were defending ourselves rather than being on the attack.” Kean played down the impact of internal party dysfunction and Coalition scandals. He said the retirement of popular incumbent MPs such as Brad Hazzard and Victor Dominello were part of the problem. Kean also refused to buy into future Liberal leadership speculation, and whether he would challenge for it. “It’s too early for that.” Liberal party reception cools as seats fall The Liberal camp is feeling increasingly nervous about key seats in western Sydney and the south coast. They remain hopeful about the seats being challenged by teal independents. The vibe in the room has taken a significant dip as seats begin to fall to Labor. The national broadcaster’s election analyst, Antony Green, has said he can “confidently say Labor will form government”, but is not yet sure if it will be a majority or minority government. Channel Seven is projecting a Coalition loss this election. Sky News is saying no Coalition majority is possible. Wakehurst probably changing hands Northern Beaches mayor Michael Regan has likely snatched the once safe Liberal seat of Wakehurst, after the retirement of the health minister, Brad Hazzard. The seat, held by the Liberals with a 21.9% margin, was the first of eight seats being contested by so-called teal independents, to be called. Early country has a 25% swing against the Liberals’ Toby Williams. Scrutineers were reporting the very popular mayor won some of the booths on the coast outright, gaining more than 50% of the vote. The seat overlaps with Warringah, the federal seat that is held by Zali Steggall. Other so-called teal seats are still being counted with Willoughby a possibility to fall to the independent, Larissa Penn. Labor are on track to take Monaro off the Nationals. Labor candidate Steven Whan is set to win that seat from the Nationals Nichole Overall, according to the ABC. This is John Barilaro’s former seat, near the ACT border. Reports Gareth Ward will retain seat Sky News are projecting that Gareth Ward will retain his seat of Kiama. Ward was ousted from the Liberal party and is running as an independent. Federal frontbencher says voters angry at cost of living Federal Liberal MP Angus Taylor is talking to the ABC about his state counterparts’ performance in this election. Taylor said he believed the NSW Coalition were being blamed by voters for cost of living pressures. “People are looking for who to blame” Taylor said it was “tough for incumbent governments”. More on the contest in Wakehurst The health minister, Brad Hazzard, is retiring and so far independent candidate Michael Regan is “looking very strong” (according to Antony Green) to win the seat ahead of the Liberal candidate Toby Williams. That would be the first seat to change hands so far. Anne Davies filed this from Regan’s event earlier. Lake Macquarie independent MP has ‘lines of communication’ with major parties The ABC has spoken to independent MP Greg Piper, who has retained his seat of Lake Macquarie. Asked if he’s had any discussions with either of the major parties heading into tonight, Piper says: We have identified the lines of communication, let’s put it that way. So no discussions, no negotiations, no deals. But we do know, if it comes down to a minority government situation, who it is who’s been delegated from those parties to have those discussions with. Based on the early count, Labor is calling Chris Minns’ seat of Kogarah as a retain. The leader holds one of the most marginal seats in the state on 0.1% after a redistribution, but early counts suggest a strong swing back to Labor in the seat. Labor is also predicting it will retain the seats of Lismore, Coogee, Bega and Strathfield. As of 7:30PM, just over 5% of the vote has been counted It’s still early in the night but some networks have already called a handful of seats and likely results based on these early results. The ABC’s election analyst Antony Green says there is a 6.7% swing towards Labor as it currently stands. He has called the following number of seats for each party, and some of those seats are named below: Coalition: 11 -Cronulla -Davidson -Upper Hunter Labor: 8 -Lismore -Maitland -Charlestown -Bega (likely) -Goulburn (Labor ahead) -Heathcote (Labor ahead) -Ryde (Labor ahead) Independents: 2 -Lake Macquarie (Greg Piper to retain his seat) -Orange (Philip Donato to retain his seat) Wakehurst independent candidate begins afterparty Lots of excitement at the Cromer sports ground’s Far Post. The campaign team seem pretty confident and candidate Michael Regan, the Northern Beaches mayor, has just arrived. Regan is probably the best chance out of the independents who are challenging in safe Liberal seats. Labor’s Janelle Saffin appears to have turned her seat of Lismore into a safe seat for the party. Early counting suggests a swing of about 16% towards Saffin in the seat. Saffin has been vocal for her community in the aftermath of repeated flood disasters in recent years. ‘A genuine contest’ is a win, says Simon Holmes à Court Simon Holmes à Court is playing down the chances of teal candidates as counting ramps up. Holmes à Court, whose fundraising group Climate 200 is supporting a number of candidates particularly in seats on Sydney’s north shore and northern beaches, told channel Seven he’ll be happy even if the efforts of some teal candidates only turns some safe Coalition seats marginal. “Bringing a genuine contest in these seats…that’s a win before we start,” he said. A few seats already called by broadcasters As of 7:15PM, just over 2.1% of votes have been counted. It’s still early days but some networks have already called a handful of seats based on these early results. These are fairly safe seats and don’t say much about the overall direction of the election tonight, but so far the ABC have called four seats for the Coalition and two for Labor. First guests arrive at the near-empty Liberal event The couple walked in holding glasses of champagne and were overheard asking “are we in the wrong place?”. A Liberal staffer reassured them that they were in the right spot. Matt Kean says a Coalition reelection would be ‘an historic victory’ The treasurer, Matt Kean, is on ABC’s election coverage tonight, and has said earlier said “the deck is stacked against” the Coalition tonight. “It would be an historic victory because it hasn’t been done before, four terms, so fighting the tide of history is like fighting gravity. The deck is stacked against us here. It is going to be Mount Everest to climb,” he said. “The challenge for us was to present ourselves as a new government, not the reiteration of a 12-year-old government,” Kean said. Kean also said that in the face of a wave of a “teal onslaught” of challengers in seats on Sydney’s north shore, the Liberal’s “strategy was to take a lot of those issues off the table before the election whether it was climate (or) energy”. “We were focusing on the core equity of the Liberal National brand which is the economy, so from January up to election day it was all about the economy.” David Elliott says ‘not good news’ for Liberal party so far Outgoing Liberal minister David Elliott says early results trickling through suggest poor performances for his party in key western Sydney seats. “Not good news for the Liberal party unfortunately,” he said on channel Seven’s coverage. Elliott said he was hearing of “significant swings in western and northwestern Sydney” and even in Castle Hill “that would suggest to me it could be an early night for a few people in western Sydney”. However Elliott said it was still early in the evening. Important to note that a large number of people have voted early this election. Results for some seats could take a while to become clear. Liberal team will be gathering at the Hilton Party organisers are expecting a few hundred guests including the premier, Dominic Perrottet, later in the evening and hoping other high-profile Liberals including former prime minister, John Howard, pop in. Party faithful are expected to arrive from 7.30. Train service outages hit Sydney In a very Sydney thing to happen on election day – there’s another train outage. Trains are not running on the T1 (western line), T2 (inner west and Leppington line) and T9 (northern line) due to urgent signal repairs at Homebush. There are flow-on effects throughout the network – screens have gone blank at Milsons Point station, for example. In a statement, Transport for NSW has said services on the North Shore, Bankstown, Cumberland, Airport &amp; South, and Central Coast and Newcastle lines are also affected. It has prompted Transport for NSW to issue a warning that anyone travelling to an NRL game at Olympic Park tonight should avoid taking the train. Train outages across the Sydney network have plagued the Coalition in recent weeks. It remains to be seen if they will be punished for the outages at the ballot box. ‘Gina’s an old family friend’ Liberal MP Anthony Roberts has confirmed that Gina Rinehart visited a polling booth in his electorate of Lane Cove today and handed out food. A volunteer who was handing out at Putney Primary told Guardian Australia a white SUV pulled up around 4pm and Rinehart got out to hand Liberal volunteers meat pies. Crossing live to Sky News just now from an election night function in his seat – where he is facing down a tough test from Climate 200-backed independent Victoria Davidson – Roberts confirmed Rinehart’s visit. “Well Gina’s an old family friend,” he said. Roberts said she handed out sandwiches and pies to volunteers of all candidates, not just Liberal volunteers. “In the rain she was out there delivering to all booth workers,” Roberts said. Key seats to watch tonight Here are some of the key seats to keep an eye on as results start coming in: Penrith - held by former deputy Liberal leader Stuart Ayres on a wafer-thin 0.6% margin. Is seen as key for Labor’s chances to win government East Hills - held by Labor on a 0.1% margin. Murray - held by former former Shooters party MP turned independent Helen Dalton on a 2.8% margin. Dalton, her former party and Nationals make this a potential three-cornered contest. Balmain - Held by retiring Greens MP Jamie Parker on a 10% margin. Lane Cove - Held by Liberal frontbencher Anthony Roberts on a 14.7% margin. Being targeted by Climate 200-backed independent Victoria Davidson. Wollondilly - Held by the Liberals on a 6% margin. Also being targeted by a Climate 200-backed independent. Kogarah - Held by Labor leader Chris Minns on a 0.1% margin. Heathcote - Held by the Liberals. But notionally Labor has a 1.7% margin. Leppington - New seat. Notionally a Labor seat with a 1.5% margin. Parramatta - Held by the Liberals on a 6.5% margin. Goulburn - Held by the Liberals on a 3.1% margin. Read more about the key seats to watch TV networks’ live coverage We’ll keep you updated on the results as they come in, but here’s a quick guide for those of you wishing to tune in to the televised coverage at the same time! The ABC’s coverage is being helmed by Sarah Ferguson, with David Speers and - of course - Antony Green leading the panel. Treasurer Matt Kean and senior Labor MP Penny Shape will join the panel. Nine’s coverage is being led by Peter Overton and will feature two former premiers - Labor’s Morris Iemma and Liberal Mike Baird - as well as NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell. Seven will have outgoing Liberal minister David Elliott, Labor frontbencher Jo Haylen and One Nation’s Mark Latham featuring in its coverage, which is being hosted by Amelia Brace and Michael Usher. Kieran Gilbert is helming Sky News’ coverage, which will feature Peta Credlin, Graham Richardson, Joel Fitzgibbon, Barnaby Joyce and NSW metropolitan roads minister Natalie Ward. Latest from Labor HQ Polls have closed across New South Wales and a few staffers are starting to file into the Labor party function at Brighton-Le-Sands in Chris Minns’ seat of Kogarah. The party is favourite to form government - either in minority of majority - ending 12 years in opposition. The final Newspoll of the election has raised hopes within Labor that majority government could be in reach. But the expectation management game is already underway with party figures stressing that with a minimum nine seats required to form majority government and only four Coalition seats with a margin under 5%, it remains a narrow path to victory. One of those seats, Goulburn in the state’s south, has not been held by Labor since 1965. NSW Labor has only formed government twice from opposition, in 1976 and in 1995. On the ABC, Coalition treasurer, Matt Kean, is also talking down the government’s chances of hanging on, saying the “deck is stacked against us” and that the party has “Mount Everest to climb”. Want to know a bit more about who could be the premier after the votes are counted? My colleague Michael McGowan has sat down with both leaders ahead of today’s poll. Read about why Dominic Perrottet has put his career on the line by poking the ClubsNSW beast and how Chris Minns has traded his charming firebrand persona for pragmatic centrism while we wait for the first results from today’s election. Volunteers for Lane Cove ‘teal’ candidate, Victoria Davidson, have told Guardian Australia that booths in Liberal Anthony Roberts‘s leafy north shore seat were visited by mining magnate Gina Rinehart this afternoon. A volunteer called David who was handing out at Putney Primary told Guardian Australia a white SUV pulled up around 4pm and Rinehart got out to hand Liberal volunteers meat pies. David said: She was handing pies to the Liberal volunteers and she was saying what a great job they were doing. She was probably there for 10 minutes or so. Apparently, they were warm, delicious pies. A photo from another booth in the electorate appeared to show Rinehart beside a large white car with Australian flags attached to the top. Guardian Australia has not confirmed with Rinehart herself. The Daily Telegraph reported Rinehart sent Roberts meat pies while he was in Covid isolation in 2021. Will we see a hung parliament? It’ll be about half an hour before we start to see the first results. Labor have been considered favourites heading into today, but polling has been tight. There’s a chance that a winner won’t be clear tonight. A hung parliament is also a strong possibility. The magic number of seats needed to form government is 47. Polls have closed! (for most of the state) Polling stations are about to close for most of the state as we approach 6PM (those in the far west of the state still have an extra half hour before the clock hits six in their time zone). We should see early results start to trickle in from 6:30PM, and we’ll of course bring you that news as it happens. Good evening, it’s Elias Visontay here from the Guardian’s election HQ in Sydney We’ll be bringing you live updates throughout the night as polls close and the counting begins. Our reporters will be at the various parties’ election functions throughout the night and you can read everything they have to say here. If you spot anything – whether at a voting centre or at an election night function – blogworthy, get in touch! You can send through tidbits to me at: elias.visontay@theguardian.com. Brace yourselves for a long night. Giddy up! And with that, I will leave the blog in the hands of Elias Visontay, thanks for reading. Teals in city’s north eyeing a long-game strategy A little way up the north shore, in the seat of Lane Cove there’s also plenty of teal T shirts around, with a little over 200 volunteers across 28 polling places. Lane Cove will be a harder seat for the teals to win, because it stretches west to Gladesville and North Ryde, where the issues of cost of living might overshadow issues of climate change, integrity and the environment. Independent candidate Victoria Davidson said: We are giving it our best shot. Everyone stands on the shoulders of the person before. If we don’t do it this time, we will do it next time. Teals a strong presence at polling booths The teal independents face an uphill battle to win the seats they are contesting thanks to optional preferential voting but they have put on a very strong ground game. Teal T-shirts are in big numbers in the seat of North Shore and at some booths seem to outnumber the Liberal royal blue T-shirts. Independent, Helen Conway, said she has 180 volunteers out staffing 27 booths in the seat of North Shore and had crowdsourced close to the fundraising cap of $193,000 As well as the mainstay teal issues of integrity and action on climate change, Conway says development pressures facing the North Shore have helped her campaign as well. In particular, the Warringah Freeway expansion, which has been causing havoc for commuters over the last couple of months, is a daily reminder. Conway says that for residents in the seat of North Shore – which is at the start of the new expanded freeway- the result could be more traffic not less. Then there is the ongoing unhappiness about the Northern Beaches link, which has resulted in clearing of trees in Cammeray. “The message to the Liberal party is people don’t want to be taken for granted. The problem with Felicity Wilson is she is a post-box not an advocate. She’s missing in action, she’s passive,” Conway said. “This is an aspirational community. They want someone to advocate for them.” she said. The Liberals have had NSW treasurer, Matt Kean co-ordinating, their fightback against the teals. It gives Kean a chance to gather intel on the teal movement, if he chooses to make the move to federal politics, most likely with a run in the overlapping federal seat of North Sydney, currently held by Kylea Tink. Parties still vying for last-minute voters Good afternoon. Polls are still open across New South Wales, and as rain begins to fall across Sydney both parties are doing whatever they can to hoover up the remaining undecided voters. Former prime minister Scott Morrison has been handing out on polling booths in the Sutherland Shire with Cronulla MP Mark Speakman and Miranda MP Eleni Petinos, both safe Liberal seats. Earlier the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was on the hustings in the seat of Balmain, which Labor is hopeful of winning back from the Greens. But election day has not been without incident. In the seat of Port Stephens in the Hunter the local MP, Kate Washington, was filmed in a heated exchange with the One Nation candidate Mark Watson. Footage of the incident taken at a polling booth at Wirreanda Public school, shows the Labor MP exchanging angry words with Watson, accusing him of “calling me a liar”. “What a load of garbage,” she can be heard saying to Watson. Washington declined to comment, but while the full context of the exchange is unclear the Guardian understands the Labor MP has been furious about some of the campaigning tactics used by some of the minor right-wing parties in her seat during the election. Port Stephens is held by Labor on a 5.8% margin. Elsewhere, in the must-win marginal seat of Heathcote covering Sydney’s southern suburbs to the north of the Illawarra, a Labor volunteer appeared to say he would “wait for you” after being told to “fuck off” by a voter. Heathcote is held by Liberal Lee Evans but became notionally Labor’s on a 1.7% margin after a redistribution. It’s a must-win for both parties. The Guardian’s Abhranil Hazra and Jessica Hromas are in the NSW electorate of Epping, currently held by Dominic Perrottet, and they spoke to voters who said they would mostly be sticking with the Liberals. Michaela said she would be sticking with the Liberals, saying she liked their consistency: I don’t think I’ll change my opinion once I get in the booth, I’ll go with the Liberals. This the second time after we got our citizenships we’ll be voting but I think they were fairly consistent with their plans for what I’ve been watching and that’s an aspect that I like, their consistency. Rares told our reporters the work the Coalition did through the pandemic earned them another term: The same, yes, they took the country through covid so its enough. Talking to the voters themselves … At an Epping polling booth, The Guardian’s Abhranil Hazra and Jessica Hromas spoke to voters who said local issues were their main concerns, with many seemingly leaning to voting Liberal. The seat is held by the Liberal premier, Dominic Perrottet, and has never been lost by the Liberal party. Heather O’Sullivan told Guardian Australia that she voted for the Labor candidate, Alan Mascarenhas, as she was opposed to privatisation and felt it was time for “a change”. Hassan, Mona and Muhammad told us they liked Perrottet’s economic policies. Dominic and his policy, from what I’ve seen, I don’t know if I’ll vote for him or not, but at least they’re bringing money into the big projects. The majority of people in the area work 9-5 jobs so, of course, it brings jobs, so he’s supporting big projects whereas Labor is cutting all of those projects, this is difference I can see. Because this Epping area is financially strong, people have more money in their pockets in comparison to other areas in Sydney, they’re educated people, they can find jobs, they can do businesses, and I’m not sure if Alan is the person for us. Angus Taylor defends Peter Dutton’s level of involvement in NSW election The opposition Treasury spokesman says the Coalition leader has been “doing what we’ve got to do at a federal level”. Speaking from the regional seat of Goulburn, Taylor told Sky News that there had been plenty of support for premier Dominic Perrottet from his federal counterparts: Peter is out and about, he is doing what we’ve got to do at the federal level, but there has been no shortage of federal representatives out there over the last couple of weeks and today out on the booths. There’s no doubt it’s going to be tough, an incumbent government with cost of living pressures like we’re seeing at the moment. The Liberal party has a broad church and we have a range of members representing their areas. Scott Morrison on NSW campaign trail Former prime minister Scott Morrison has made a rare appearance today, supporting NSW attorney general Mark Speakman and Liberal MP Eleni Petinos on the campaign trail. Morrison posted a selfie on Instagram with both MPs, cheering his Shire colleagues on: Pleased to be out supporting our local Liberal Shire team today with Mark Speakman and Eleni Petinos MP #keepnswmovingforward. Labor’s Penny Sharpe: ‘a lot of seats that we need to win’ in NSW election Leader of the opposition in the upper house, Penny Sharpe was at Stanmore public school earlier today, where she told reporters she was cautious about the vote, even though polls showed Labor slightly ahead of the Coalition. She also said that key seats Labor needs to win – including Holsworthy, Leppington and East Hills – all featured candidates that were “strong local people”. There are a lot of seats that we need to win or that are on very big margins. So a lot of different contests, which has always been the issue with this campaign. So many different contests, how are they going to fall? Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you this afternoon, bringing you all the latest as polls begin winding down in NSW. That’s it for me today. Mostafa Rachwani will be bringing you the afternoon’s news and the latest from the NSW election, with a few hours left of voting. Sydney to install more statues of women after its public art labelled a ‘sausage party’ A councillor has described Sydney’s public art as “sausage party” amid a campaign to balance gender representation among the city’s public statues. There are just six public statues of women in the city of Sydney, including two of Queen Victoria and one of saint Mary MacKillop. The trend extends across all Australian states. Six out of 33 statues in the city of Adelaide are of women – making it the state with the highest proportion of statues of women. In Melbourne and Brisbane, women make up only 15% of statues. Labor councillor Linda Scott moved a motion for the city of Sydney to set up a public art advisory panel to guide the process of delivering at least three new artworks “celebrating, commemorating or depicting women”. The motion was passed by majority of councillors on 13 March, but there is not yet a timeline of when the artworks will be commissioned. Here’s Scott: When it comes to Sydney statues, it’s unfortunately a bit of a sausage party. There are about five times as many statues of birds in the city of Sydney than there are of women. Analysis – Judgment day arrives for NSW Labor after 12 years in the political wilderness On Friday, as Labor’s election bus took a final, weary lap through a clutch of key seats in Sydney’s west, the upper house MP and unofficial campaign DJ Rose Jackson began blasting One Day More, from the musical Les Misérables. “Tomorrow is the judgment day.” Heavy-handed? Possibly. But after three months of campaigning you can forgive them the obvious metaphor. After 12 long years, Saturday can’t come quick enough for New South Wales Labor. Though polls have tightened in recent weeks, this is an election Labor expects to win. Facing a 12-year-old government beset by scandals, high-profile retirements and on to its fourth premier, anything less would be a disaster. The path to victory is not easy, however. Read the full analysis here: More than 1.5m early votes registered Early voting is becoming increasingly common, as we’ve seen in recent federal and state elections. This has changed the way leaders campaign as they need to convince voters well before polling day. According to the New South Wales Electoral Commission, more than 1.5 million people had already voted in the state election before today. Perrottet sells Coalition’s economic credentials Pink cupcakes, blue shirts and plenty of sausages greeted Premier Dominic Perrottet as he cast his vote in his bid to lead the Coalition to a historic fourth term in power in NSW. Accompanied by his wife Helen and the couple’s youngest daughter, Celeste, the premier said “it’s a very important day for the future of our state – there’s a lot at stake”. Our party has been a team for over 12 years that has transformed NSW ... We’ve turned the economy around, built the schools and hospitals, the trains and motorways that’s transformed people’s lives. He also lauded the Coalition’s economic credentials as getting families through rampant inflation. You can’t support households if you don’t have a strong budget. It is strong economic and financial management that ensures downward pressure on household budgets ... and we’ve done that. - AAP Vote, sausage, swim Is this the most scenic polling booth in Sydney? Labor got in early to take the best real estate at Clovelly surf club. But the mood was upbeat from all sides as they fired up the barbecue and the process of democracy. Voting in your bathers is perfectly acceptable. Just circling back to the prime minister’s press conference earlier today. Anthony Albanese clearly made the case for a change of state government, but his criticism of Dominic Perrottet himself was muted in comparison to his attack on the NSW Liberals. I think New South Wales needs a change of government. You see a government when it’s at the end of its life, when it’s too busy fighting each other. And Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both very good people. I like both of them. I’ve worked closely with Dominic Perrottet, he’s been constructive in his relationships as the New South Wales premier. But the government he leads is a complete shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other and fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting other Nationals, to actually fight for the people of NSW. They’re distracted from the business of delivering better education and health services, and they’re obsessed with privatising essential assets. We can’t afford any more privatisation in NSW. Dutton notably absent on NSW election day The federal opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has been missing from the Coalition’s campaign throughout the lead-up to the NSW poll. Premier Dominic Perrottet batted away questions about Dutton’s absence on Saturday, telling Seven’s Sunrise program that he didn’t need a “wingman” for his election pitch: This is an election on NSW issues, it’s a NSW election. Of course, Dutton’s seat of Dickson is in Queensland, which explains why he hasn’t been voting this morning. NSW treasurer Matt Kean has refused to get involved in the consequences of a potential Coalition loss today, saying he won’t comment on whether he would make a leadership tilt. Speaking to Sky News, Kean said premier Dominic Perrottet would remain, “whatever happens tonight”: I’m sure that he’ll continue to keep fighting whatever happens tonight. I intend to ensure that we win government. The key things is that we ensure we hold our heartland seats ... History is against us ... We don’t intend to lose tonight. What I want to do is to make sure we continue to build a strong economy, ... and that’s what I’m going to keep fighting for. Analysis – Peter Dutton risks cementing his reputation as a wrecker Chief political correspondent Paul Karp’s column today is about Peter Dutton and where he finds himself on the voice issue. It’s not clear which way he will swing, but Labor are apparently convinced that he will end up on the no side and therefore increasing their chances of inflicting a damaging defeat on the Albanese government. The leader of the opposition has been engaged in a three-month shadow campaign on the surface demanding details about the voice but in substance raising doubts that drive down support for it. That campaign is now likely to be extended because Albanese opted against proposals to limit the voice’s powers by giving it input into decisions of parliament but not the executive government. The risks of that path are that he dooms the party to cycle of very negative positions which could backfire. The danger for the Liberals is that without proper deliberation they will be locked into opposition for its own sake on big calls that could damage their leader and their brand. Labor has framed the voice as a chance for national leadership from both sides, and urged Dutton not to repeat the mistake of boycotting the apology to the Stolen Generations (for which he apologised). Here’s the full piece again: Australia’s aquaculture industry looks beyond fishmeal to improve sustainability Australia’s growing aquaculture industry is trying to end its reliance on fishmeal in order to become more sustainable. Fish farms have traditionally been reliant on fishmeal, a feed made from small fish such as anchovies which is often fished unsustainably in developing countries. The practice has jeopardised the industry’s environmental credentials, says Ian Urbania, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and founder of non-profit journalism organisation The Outlaw Ocean Project: The whole reason for aquaculture was to slow down ocean depletion. And then they got hooked on feeding and fattening the fish faster. A lot of these fisheries use bottom trawlers with a lot of bycatch, and often smaller species and baby fish, which depletes the ocean more than the wild-catch fishing it was intended to replace. In Australia, where fish farms are steadily overtaking wild-caught fish as the predominant form of seafood production, the industry has worked to move away from the controversial feed product. Co-owners of troubled Queensland coal plant in voluntary administration Plans to bring central Queensland’s troubled Callide C coal-fired power station back online are slated to go ahead despite its co-owners sliding into voluntary administration. The power station near Biloela has been plagued with issues, having catastrophically failed after an explosion in its turbine hall in May 2021. The resulting outage hit more than 470,000 homes and businesses between the NSW border and Cape York. Part of a cooling tower collapsed at the power station in October last year, 16 months after the explosion. Both its C3 and C4 generating units remain offline after the incidents. Deloitte turnaround and restructuring partners Grant Sparks and Richard Hughes were on Friday announced as voluntary administrators over four IG Energy Group entities: IG Power, IG Energy Holdings, IG Power Holdings and IG Power Marketing. - AAP PM avoids the traditional sausage eating snap: ‘It’s not going to happen’ The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has gone to some length to ensure photographers don’t get a shot of him eating a democracy sausage. He tried shielding the snack with a paper plate before turning around and saying: They’re going to try and get the sausage shot. It’s not going to happen. Perhaps Albanese is eager to avoid the mistake made by former Labor leader Bill Shorten, who inexplicably attacked the sausage from the middle while campaigning. Labor heavyweights join campaign The prime minister and environment minister are out campaigning this morning. Tanya Plibersek is voting in her own electorate of Sydney and is joined by NSW Labor senator Tony Sheldon. Will we get a result on election night? Given the likelihood of a hung NSW parliament, it’s definitely possible we won’t get a final result on election night. According to the NSW Electoral Commission, counting will cease on election night at 10:30pm. Any other vote counting not completed on election night will continue on Monday with no counts taking place on Sunday. More on this here: Why bosses should think twice before those after-hours emails Stepping away from the NSW election for just a moment. Some new research suggests managers should let up on their constant barrage of out-of-hours contact with workers or risk their staff burning out. Researchers from Australia, the US and Europe have found unnecessary and non-urgent contact after workers are supposed to have clocked off is causing elevated stress levels and depressive moods among employees. The Covid-19 pandemic forced people to embrace working from home, bringing the undeniable perks of flexibility and reclaimed commuting time. But the ease of contact in a digitalised workplace is a double-edged sword, with the promise of work-from-home freedom in fact delivering the opposite outcome, according to RMIT researcher Mayowa Babalola: Borderless workplaces are giving managers 24/7 access to employees where constant connectivity with managers is an expectation rather than an option. We found many are realising that the constant ping of (Microsoft) Teams and late-night emails are bringing work stress and depressive symptoms into their personal lives. The collaborative international study, which involved Melbourne’s RMIT among other institutions, surveyed nearly 900 Americans in blue- and white-collar jobs, finding the results were relevant across industries from administration and finance to construction and plumbing. Minns ‘will make a great premier’, Albanese says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has made a few remarks after voting in the electorate of Ryde in Sydney’s north-west. He’s been asked what a Labor victory would mean federally: I’ve worked very closely with Chris [Minns] and we have similar values. I campaigned strongly yesterday, I was in Penrith and Riverstone, the day before I was in Monaro. Today I am in Ryde and Drummoyne and Summer Hill and Balmain. I’ll be out and about because I think he will make a great premier of New South Wales and I hope he is successful. This is a Coalition-held seat. This isn’t my first visit to this seat. I have been here before for two reasons: for the cause of Labor but secondly, Lyndal [Howison] is, I think, just outstanding. I really want to see Lyndal be the member of Ryde because I know the capacity that she will bring to the job. South Australia has recorded its first case of measles in a resident since 2019 after a three-year-old boy was infected. The boy, from regional South Australia, was infected while travelling overseas. SA Health warned anyone who wasn’t fully vaccinated against the measles to keep watch for symptoms over the next few weeks, particularly if they visited certain areas during specific times. The warning areas included Murray Bridge Swimming Centre on Friday, March 17 between 4pm and 6pm, and the Murray Bridge hospital emergency department waiting area on Wednesday, March 22 between 9.30am and 1pm. The boy also visited the waiting area on Thursday, March 23 between 9am and 9.45am. There were two additional warning areas for Thursday: the Bridge Clinic at Murray Bridge between 9.30am and 11.15am, and the Women’s and Children’s hospital emergency department waiting area between noon and 12.45pm. Symptoms start with fever, cough, runny nose and sore eyes, which were followed by a blotchy rash, SA Health said. The rash usually began on the head and then spread down the body. - AAP Albanese votes with local candidate in Sydney’s north-west The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is voting this morning at the West Ryde Public School with the Labor candidate, Lyndal Howison, and the federal member for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale. We may hear from Albanese after he votes, but likely only a few short remarks if anything. Minns in ultra-marginal East Hills: ‘the voters decide what is a safe seat’ Labor leader Chris Minns is holding a press conference on election day. He has spent the morning so far campaigning in the seat of East Hills, the most marginal electorate in the state held by the Liberals. Here’s a taste of what he said: It’s hard for me to know how many people go to the booth undecided, but they will be met by Labor candidates across New South Wales who are energetic, excited about the future, and I am always amazed when I go to really safe conservative electorates and you have got a bright, bouncy Labor candidate who has put their heart and soul into our message in an electorate that is very, very tough for them to win. Voters have got a funny way of determining what is a safe seat and a marginal seat and as soon as a political party on both sides believes that electorate is in the bag, more often than not the voters rise up and say, we will decide that, not you guys. What is Antony Green looking for? The ABC’s election analyst, Anthony Green, is already in front of the touch screen breaking down the key seats and trends. He’s told the ABC he’ll be looking at some regional electorates to start: I’ll be looking for trends in the country because there are a couple of seats up in the north Tweed and the Murray. The Nationals think they might be able to gain that. If it is close at the end of all that, we’ll be looking at the city. There are some seats in the northern suburbs where there are independents running against the Liberal party. We have a band of seats in Winston Hills, in Parramatta, Penrith, which are all at risk, and a lot in the south. We will be watching all of those seats because the more seats that fall, the more likely you get a majority Labor government. Or will it be a hung parliament? If we will not know the result on the night there could be a negotiation for weeks ahead. Labor posters focus on leader Economics correspondent Peter Hannam has noticed Labor campaign material is highlighting the leader Chris Minns and his leadership team, at least at this polling station in Balmain. Australians don’t want ‘American style’ campaigns with personal attacks, Minns says Earlier we heard from NSW premier Dominic Perrottet, who revealed he exchanged texts with Labor leader Chris Minns last night. The pair wished each other good luck ahead of today’s poll. The text messages are being interpreted by some, including Weekend Today hosts, as a sign of a more civilised election campaign, especially when compared with what we’ve seen at federal elections in recent years. Here’s the exchange: HOST: “It’s been a pretty civilised election campaign Chris. Why do you think that has been the way? Why hasn’t it got personal like it has in other states and federally, do you think? MINNS: Yeah, I think probably because the premier and myself like each other and I think that there’s a common respect there. We’ve managed to keep that for the entire election campaign and I’m hoping it becomes a feature of, if not NSW politics, then Australian politics. You don’t have to take the low road and you don’t always have to, I guess, land a low blow. We can have an argument, if you like, about policies and who has got the better ideas for the future of NSW. So I think it has been a good feature of this election campaign that neither Dom or myself have launched personal attacks. You don’t need to run politics like that. I don’t think we want to go down that American-style democracy where it’s just a fight to the bitter end and there’s no decency among the people who are running against each other. Minns: NSW needs ‘new ideas and new perspectives’ Labor leader Chris Minns spoke to Weekend Today earlier this morning about that Newspoll in the Australian, which projects him to win today’s New South Wales election with a majority of seats. Minns said his team is not taking anything for granted: Polls don’t always get it right. Not everybody’s voted. In fact, most people still haven’t voted yet. No one has been elected. So I can promise everybody who is watching at home today, we are taking absolutely nothing for granted. We know it’s the people of NSW that decide elections and basically polls, at this point, aren’t worth anything because people actually have to get out and vote. So we’re hopeful. We’re going into this election with a hungry but humble philosophy, if you like, but it’s up to the people of NSW and we’re fighting for every vote. Minns was also asked if he and his team were ready to govern the state. It’s been 12 years since Labor were in government in New South Wales. Here’s his response: Absolutely. I’ve got a team that’s committed, united and very disciplined. It’s run an election campaign that has been hopeful and optimistic about what’s possible in NSW. I think what’s required and needed in NSW today is new ideas and new perspectives. Because if we have same policies that we’ve had for the last four years, we will have the same results for the next four years and what people in NSW need at the moment is change. Minns: ‘Feeling good, feeling optimistic’ Labor leader Chris Minns has also addressed reporters while campaigning. Minns was asked about today’s Newspoll, published in the Australian, which found he was “poised to lead the ALP into government after 12 years in the wilderness”. Newspoll’s two-party-preferred result of 54.5-45.5 would represent a 6.5% swing against the Coalition since 2019. He’s what Minns told reporters: Feeling good, feeling optimistic. Now over to the people of New South Wales. REPORTER: Good poll today? There’s only one poll that counts. No, look people have to have their say and with a couple of hours to go, we are urging people to get out and cast a positive vote for change. REPORTER: How many hours sleep? A full night’s sleep. Absolutely. Thanks, guys. REPORTER: Are you going at it until the dying stage? Yeah, absolutely. Dominic Perrottet has given some more expansive comments after voting a short time ago in his seat of Epping. He and Labor leader Chris Minns spoke last night, exchanging text messages and wishing each other good luck. Here’s some more from the premier: It’s a real honour to serve the people of New South Wales. There’s a lot at stake in this election. I will be working hard all day. REPORTER: What would it mean for the Coalition to be delivered a historic fourth term? It’s not about the Liberal or National party. Ultimately, elections are about our people. My team has the plan to deal with the challenges of today, but we’re all wanting to set up the state for the children. REPORTER: The polling suggests that you have done a great job, you are popular. Do you think your baggage, in a way, is actually the Liberal party? That you’re popular but people are reluctant to bring in the Liberal party again? Our party has been here for 12 years, it’s transformed New South Wales. We were the worst performing economy, the state had stalled. We’ve turned that around. We’ve built schools and hospitals, the motorways have transformed people’s lives. But it’s all about the future and where we go from here. I believe my team has the plan, the experience, energy and ideas to take the state forward. Perrottet: ‘It’s a very important day’ Dominic Perrottet has made a few very brief remarks before voting in his seat of Epping in north-west Sydney. Here’s what he said: I love election day. It’s a great day. Ultimately, it’s a very important day for people in New South Wales. It’s a privilege to be the premier of the best state in this country and my team’s got the plan to deal with the challenges of today, obviously New South Wales moving forward and setting it up for our children. Reporter: Did the kids have a message for you this morning? Good luck. Need a quick catch-up on the NSW election? My colleagues Mostafa Rachwani and Abhranil Hazra have compiled a very handy, easy to read, explainer for you. It’s got lots of information about how and where to vote, but also looks at possible outcomes such as: Could the election result in a hung parliament? With a larger number of independents running and hoping to hurt the incumbent government’s chances, there is a high likelihood the election will result in a hung parliament, with neither party able to form majority government. Both Labor and the Coalition require 47 seats to win government, with the Coalition currently sitting on 45 seats, and Labor on 38. It is highly likely the Greens will back Labor to form government, but it could still fall short. If both parties fall short, they will both need to enter negotiations with the crossbench. The Coalition has technically been in minority government since 2021, when MPs John Sidoti and Gareth Ward moved to the crossbench, while Andrew Constance resigned and Labor picked up his seat in a byelection. You can read the full story here: Find your closest polling booth The NSW Electoral Commission is here to help: Australian banks predict another interest rate rise Australia’s big four banks are forecasting future interest rate rises, ignoring bets in financial markets that the cash rate has reached its peak. ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac believe the RBA will lift its key interest rate by at least another 25 basis points, based on economic data already released. Earlier this month, the RBA hiked the rate for a record 10th consecutive time to 3.6%. Investors responded to turmoil in financial markets over the past fortnight by slashing expectations about RBA rate moves, predicting the next move would be lower, after US authorities rescued Silicon Valley Bank and two others and the Swiss government helped UBS take over the ailing financial services company Credit Suisse. However, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and even the Swiss National Bank each lifted official interest rates this week, viewing the fight against inflation higher priority than easing the squeeze on their respective economies. Australia’s main commercial banks think the RBA have at least as much reason to stay on its inflation-beating course given the relative stability of the country’s financial system. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, this week said he was receiving twice-daily briefings and that “our banks are well-regulated, well-capitalised and highly liquid and are in a better position than most to deal with these disruptions”. The democracy sausages are sizzling If you’re out voting in NSW this morning, let us know what’s going on. Voting under way in NSW Voting is under way in NSW, with more than 4 million people across the state set to decide who will form government for the next four years. By Friday close to a quarter of the state’s 5.5 million voters had cast their ballots, AAP reported, with nearly 1.2 million people pre-polling and 92,000 lodging postal votes. The premier, Dominic Perrottet, and the Labor leader, Chris Minns, have campaigned hard in key seats in western Sydney, where one in 10 Australians live and could well decide the election result. Perrottet is expected to vote in his seat of Epping, in Sydney’s north-west while Minns will cast his vote in the seat of Kogarah, in the city’s south, which he holds by a 0.1 per cent margin. The premier is seeking a fourth consecutive four-year term for his Liberal-National coalition on a platform of responsible financial management he says would fund life-changing infrastructure. It would be the first time the party has managed the feat since 1973. Western Sydney ‘a tight contest’ Western Sydney could be key to the NSW election result today. As Andy Marks from Western Sydney University explains, there are a number of seats in play. Here’s what Marks told ABC News a short time ago: Election time is our time to shine in western Sydney, it seems. It’s always a tight contest. This time round, it’s no different. There’s roughly about seven seats that are in play. So its common place to see politicians on every corner. You’ll notice that a lot of the big announcements have been made in western Sydney, both major parties camped out there for a few weeks. Marks said it was difficult to call who would win the majority of seats in western Sydney. Polling has taken a battering as well, since the Morrison victory against the odds. It’s very difficult to gauge whether or not the polling is accurate. And also, this is different because it’s a bit of a street by street contest. Neighbourhood issues that are bubbling up as opposed to the big ticket stuff. Share market falls for seventh straight week The local share market has endured its seventh consecutive losing week as interest rate hikes and fears about the stability of the global banking system weighed on sentiment. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished the trading week yesterday afternoon down 13.4 points, or 0.19%, to 6,955.2, after having been down as much as 0.65% in the first 15 minutes of trading, Australian Associated Press reports. For the week the ASX200 lost 39.6 points, or 0.57%. Its seven-week losing streak is its longest such stretch since nine consecutive weeks of losses during the global financial crisis in mid-2008. Recent weeks have seen the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the US and the Swiss investment bank, Credit Suisse. On Friday shares in Deutsche Bank, another European investment bank that has struggled since the GFC, fell 14%. Overnight the Bank of England raised rates by 25 basis points, a widely anticipated move after official data released Wednesday showed higher than expected inflation, with consumer prices rising 10.4 per cent in the year to February. While some economists have suggested that the global banking chaos might prompt the Reserve Bank to pause its rate hike campaign at its next meeting a week from Tuesday, Tadgell said he thought it was “highly probable” that Australia’s central bank would again hike rates. The ASX’s 11 official sectors were mixed on Friday, with five gaining ground and six losing it. On Friday, NAB was the biggest loser among the Big Four banks, falling 1.6% to $27.18. CBA dropped 1.2% to $95.84, ANZ retreated 1.1% to $22.52 and Westpac subtracted 0.6% to $21.20. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage on a day that will be dominated by the state election in New South Wales. The election promises to be the closest for 16 years following a run of fairly comfortable Coalition wins. Labor, under the leadership of Chris Minns, believes it will end its 12-year stint in the wilderness but the Coalition is pinning its hopes on premier Dominic Perrottet’s disciplined campaign. The final Newspoll of the election pointed to a Labor win by 54.5% to 45.5%, a 6.5% swing since the 2019 election and enough to secure 10 seats. Can they do it? Here’s everything you need to know about the big day. A constitutional expert has described the proposed the proposed Indigenous voice as a “safe and sensible” legal option, dismissing concerns that the advisory body would be too powerful. George Williams, professor of law at the University of New South Wales, says the change is “strikingly modest” and “should remove doubts that parliament is fettered or limited”. Our chief political correspondent, Paul Karp, writes today that opposition leader Peter Dutton faces a dilemma about whether to support the reform. Go with yes and he risks being sidelined. Back a no vote and he will cement his reputation as a wrecker. The Australian stock market could be in for another sticky day on Monday after shares fell sharply again in Europe overnight amid continued fears about the banking system. In Friday’s session in Sydney, the ASX fell for the seventh week running and it was down by 0.19% on the day. Futures point to the index opening down 1% on Monday morning. It comes as Australian banks think the RBA will raise rates again a week on Tuesday despite the market turmoil which some have speculated might bring an end to the record 10 successive months of hikes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jul/29/its-exciting-its-powerful-how-translated-fiction-captured-a-new-generation-of-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T08:00:34Z","webTitle":"‘It’s exciting, it’s powerful’: how translated fiction captured a new generation of readers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/29/its-exciting-its-powerful-how-translated-fiction-captured-a-new-generation-of-readers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jul/29/its-exciting-its-powerful-how-translated-fiction-captured-a-new-generation-of-readers","fields":{"bodyText":"There was a buzz in the room at this year’s International Booker prize ceremony in May, as some eye-opening – and encouraging – numbers were shared by the organisers. The figures, from a broad survey of book buyers, showed that sales of translated fiction increased 22% last year, compared to 2021 – and that it is most popular among readers under 35, who account for almost 50% of translated fiction sales. This is much higher than the 31% share of overall fiction sales bought by these readers – and the figures have grown year on year. For translated fiction, the future looks bright. So much so that in some cases books by certain publishers have become a “cultural accessory”. So how did it become cool, and which are the names to watch out for? Undoubtedly the International Booker prize itself has boosted the profile of fiction from around the world published in English. Fiammetta Rocco has been the prize’s administrator from its launch as an annual award in 2016, and since then its winners have enjoyed enormous attention and sales boosts. Last year’s winner, Tomb of Sand by Geetanjali Shree, translated by Daisy Rockwell, increased its sales from 500 copies before its nomination to 25,000 copies in the nine months after its win. (Not bad for a 624-page epic about a woman who won’t get out of bed.) And the first winner, Han Kang’s The Vegetarian in 2016, translated by Deborah Smith, about a Korean woman who begins to refuse society’s expectations in strange and unsettling ways, did even better, Rocco tells me. “This is a book that had sold 2,000 copies in Korean over 10 years,” she says. “It’s now sold half a million in English, and a lot more in Korean as a result.” This is no coincidence. As Rocco points out, the intention was always for the International Booker prize to be more than just “a book award with a nice dinner. We always wanted it to have a bigger presence.” As a result, it has helped “writers [in translation] become more part of the mainstream”. And the success of the prize’s winners has helped correct the reputation of translated fiction “for kind of being difficult”. Frank Wynne, whose translations of novels from French and Spanish have won many prizes, agrees. “Our generation [born in the 1960s] suffered from the notion that translated fiction was like castor oil: not very pleasant but probably good for you. And it shouldn’t be good for you, or bad for you, or anything else. What people are looking for is to engage with a book.” Of the eight winners to date, six have come from independent publishers. Wynne is confident that “the huge contribution made by smaller publishers in the last 10 or 15 years” is part of the picture. Young editors and translators today are “in the vanguard”, as Rocco puts it. “They’re the scouts, they bring the stuff in.” One of the most significant young publishers of translated fiction is Jacques Testard’s Fitzcarraldo Editions, which since its inception in 2014 has published one International Booker prize winner (Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights, translated by Jennifer Croft) and three Nobel literature laureates: Tokarczuk, Annie Ernaux and Svetlana Alexievich. So what is Fitzcarraldo’s secret? “First and foremost, it’s literary quality,” says Testard. “Also, we exist on the margins; we have the luxury of being able to be interested when we want to be, rather than having to keep up with so-called hot books.” Reader loyalty is helped by the fact that this is “very much a publishing house that publishes authors rather than books”. As to why its titles might appeal to younger readers: “We’re keen to publish books that engage with the contemporary world. There are obvious themes you can pull out of a lot of the fiction we publish” – he cites femicide in Fernanda Melchor’s Hurricane Season, translated by Sophie Hughes, and the occupation of Palestine in Adania Shibli’s Minor Detail, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette – “that are pertinent to understanding the world we live in. Maybe that is resonating with younger readers.” Testard thinks “Brexit is in there somewhere. It might not be a direct correlation. But lots of young people voted to stay in the EU. Maybe being interested in cultures outside the UK is cool.” Stefan Tobler, the founder of Sheffield‑based independent publisher And Other Stories, agrees. The majority of the books he publishes are in translation, including Boulder by Eva Baltasar, translated by Julia Sanches and shortlisted for this year’s International Booker prize. “Younger readers clearly don’t have the barriers and hangups of older readers, and that’s true about translation, queer writing or other previously marginalised authors,” he says. “It does feel like the desire to read beyond barriers is partly a movement against those Brexit barriers the older generations voted for.” That is certainly true for one reader I spoke to. Grace Spencer, a recent English literature graduate currently working in France, identifies Brexit as a trigger point in her reading of translated fiction. “I don’t want to overpoliticise it – it’s also just about what you like to read in bed – but part of my attraction is to enact an open-mindedness to the international community. I was only 15 when the Brexit vote happened; I couldn’t vote and I found it very frustrating. A lot of [people my age] want to keep this international mindset open.” Recommendations, she says, come from friends – and she gives them back too: “I’m very evangelical!” – but also from social media. “BookTok is a big one”, that is, the videos on TikTok where people talk about books. “There’ll be recommendation videos,” says Spencer, “if you liked this, you’ll like these, or [books] grouped together by language.” In a world of interconnectivity and infinite choice, the personal endorsements on social media are more effective than Amazon’s algorithms. One of BookTok’s most enthusiastic users is Rachel Atkin from Sheffield, who shares her thoughts as@booksnpunks. Her TikTok account is a persuasive place. Recent videos include a rave for Alain Mabanckou’s African Psycho, translated by Christine Schwartz Hartley, a cover splash of “All the books I’ve rated 5 stars this year” (all but two of which are in translation) and a review of Roberto Bolaño’s epic masterpiece 2666, translated by Natasha Wimmer, which – TikTok being a short-form medium – is split into two parts. Atkin emphasises the political nature of some translated fiction reading. With a particular interest in Latin American fiction, she says, “we’ve had a lot of people talking about political stuff in [South America], we’ve had Borges and García Márquez. Now we’ve got Mariana Enríquez talking about it, we’ve got Nona Fernández talking about the Pinochet regime.” There seems to be a transgressive quality to some translated fiction. Is that appealing? “That genre of ‘messed-up’ books has just exploded on TikTok,” says Atkin. “There’s videos of ‘Five messed-up books you need to read’, ‘Five books that will freak you out’.” She gives the example of Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori, about a lonely woman who finds community in the striplit safety of a shop, until it unleashes a latent psychopathic streak. “Everyone talks about her book as being the most disgusting they’ve ever read. There’s an element of people wanting to read things that are pushing the boundaries.” Speaking of Murata – or of Mieko Kawakami, whose novel Breasts and Eggs, translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd, is another favourite, and whose work is striking for its portrayal of women in modern society – it’s impossible to talk about translated fiction without considering Japanese fiction in particular. Rocco points out that young people “don’t seem to be reading the languages that were classically regarded as the drivers of the canon”, that is, western European languages. In fact, of the 2m books of translated fiction sold in Britain last year, she tells me, “the single most popular language – just under half a million volumes – was Japanese” (not including manga), “followed by South Korean”. (Anton Hur, a Booker-longlisted translator, recently wrote that after The Vegetarian won in 2016, “all of a sudden, Korean literature was seen as edgy and fierce”.) Lucy North, an established translator of Japanese, is not surprised. Why does she think Japanese literature is so popular? “Japanese writers excel at short fiction. And it tends to be quiet and undramatic and often nonjudgmental. There’s a feeling of criticism and oppositionality in it, but it’s veiled. So there’s that, with a kind of mystery, that’s appealing to young readers.” North says Murata’s Convenience Store Woman was a watershed, “after which lots of other women writers’ works started flowing in. It’s an amazing time to be a translator,” she adds. “Editors are much more open-minded than they were before.” Wynne agrees. “I remember an editor saying to me at a party: ‘What do you do?’ And I said I translate fiction. And he said: ‘Oh, we did a translation once. It didn’t work!’” One publisher at the forefront of Japanese literature is Pushkin Press – owned and run since 2012 by Adam Freudenheim. Pushkin published David Diop’s 2021 International Booker prize winner At Night All Blood Is Black, translated by Anna Moschovakis, about a Senegalese soldier in the first world war and his descent into madness. Like Fitzcarraldo, it is small enough to follow its own taste – “We’re not just looking at the market and reacting to it,” says Freudenheim – so it tends to drive publishing patterns rather than follow them. Pushkin has been in the vanguard of the recent boom in Japanese literature, from locked-room crime such as Soji Shimada’s The Tokyo Zodiac Murders, translated by Ross and Shika Mackenzie, to its Japanese novella series including Kawakami’s Ms Ice Sandwich, translated by Louise Heal Kawai, launched in 2017 and about to begin a second run. Freudenheim adds: “It’s an enormous country with a long-established literary tradition – Kawabata, Mishima, Tanizaki – [so] you already have that bedrock there. But there’s something quite strange and unusual about a lot of Japanese literature.” He points out that while a lot of its themes are related to western concerns, this is often seen through “a slightly different lens”, for example in the case of women’s rights. This chimes with Rocco’s observation that younger readers are “very interested in the concerns of young women around the world. Not so much in a political sense, but more in terms of their personal experience.” Atkin agrees: she was “really happy” to see Guadalupe Nettel’s Still Born, translated by Rosalind Harvey, about a woman who doesn’t want to have children, shortlisted for the International Booker. Another favourite is Cho Nam-joo’s Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, translated by Jamie Chang: “It talks about being a woman in the workplace, and sexual assault in the workplace,” she says. Freudenheim is enthusiastic about the power of social media to bring younger readers to books. He points to Argentinian writer Agustina Bazterrica’s novel Tender Is the Flesh, translated by Sarah Moses, as “one of our most successful titles of the last couple of years. And that’s been driven by TikTok, first in America, then here. We didn’t make that happen, it was readers sharing it.” (Tender Is the Flesh, in which humans are farmed for food, fits firmly into what Atkin calls “messed-up books”. Another BookToker included it in a list titled “What the f*ck did I just read books”.) But there’s another element to the appeal of some translated books. Instagram and TikTok are visual media, and the books that catch people’s eyes on the thumbnail of a scrolling feed are those with the most striking design. Curiously, though, the publisher of translated fiction with the greatest cachet among young readers is one that has given its books the plainest – yet most distinctive – look imaginable: the solid blue-and-white covers of Fitzcarraldo. The contents must stand up, of course: “I really like everything [they] publish,” Spencer says, while Atkin’s TikTok offers a video on where to start with Fitzcarraldo (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced). But the austere designs do add a special quality: “The cover is so iconic now,” Spencer says, “and if you’ve got one on your Instagram photo of your picnic rug, it’s immediately a kind of cultural accessory.” Rocco recalls seeing two graduate students at an event at the Southbank Centre in London for this year’s International Booker prize, “and they both had Fitzcarraldo books, which they were carrying around in these macramé bags so that you could see the blue cover. They were sort of totemic signs, a way of communicating to other people that you were ‘blue team’!” (Non-younger readers, like me, may recall a similar chic to Picador white spines in the 1980s.) Of this already iconic design, Testard says: “We wanted to publish with a series look, and if you publish books of sufficient literary quality, you might get people following the press and picking up books without knowing who the author is.” He adds, however, that the coolness of Fitzcarraldo “is not going to make any difference whatsoever to what we do. Cultural fads are cyclical, [and] in three years’ time we might be out of fashion.” Fitzcarraldo, in other words, doesn’t lean into the aesthetic some of its readers celebrate (though as Testard acknowledges, “We do sell tote bags”). Tobler makes a similar point. “We choose according to what we love. We don’t publish according to market research. Hence we are one of the few publishers yet to make our fortune off a Japanese cat book, alas.” Reading is about discovery, and reading outside your own culture challenges your view of the world – something young people are wired to do more readily than older readers. “Young people today,” Wynne suggests, “are less wary of the idea that a book is in translation. If it’s exciting, if it’s powerful, if it speaks to them, why wouldn’t they read it?” “I think it comes down to the idea of reading against the grain,” Atkin says. “It always makes me so happy that I’m connecting with people around the world.” Found in translation Five authors to look out for Mieko Kawakami (Japan) Kawakami’s work encompasses the cute (Ms Ice Sandwich, about a boy’s obsession with a sales assistant) and the cutting, with All the Lovers in the Night, translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd, and Breasts and Eggs pointing the finger at social expectations of womanhood and femininity. Kawakami interviewed Haruki Murakami in 2017, challenging him about sexism in his work. Since then, a new generation of readers, hungry for a modern view of Japanese society, have made her the coolest Japanese cult author since Murakami himself. Sang Young Park (South Korea) Park’s funny, lively, affecting novel Love in the Big City, translated by Anton Hur, was a bestseller in Korea before being longlisted for the 2022 International Booker prize. It’s all about the love the narrator has experienced – for friends, for his mother, and for the men in his life – and about aspects of queer existence, from Kylie to HIV. Like any great book, Park’s work blends specificity with universality: “I would’ve thought it was an extremely Korean story,” he said, “but most of the reviews spoke as if the events had happened to them, which made me very happy.” Samanta Schweblin (Argentina) Schweblin, whose books have been translated by Megan McDowell, is one of a number of South American authors, including Mariana Enriquez and Agustina Bazterrica, who have made a name in English (and on TikTok) from stories of creepiness and disgust. (Just the title of her collection Mouthful of Birds is weirdly revolting.) Her novella Fever Dream is terrifying despite and because of the vagueness of the horror, while Little Eyes gives a nightmarish angle to robotic pets that aim to connect the lonely but enable users to spy on one another. Benjamín Labatut (Chile) Labatut’s mixed upbringing (the Netherlands, Argentina, Chile) is reflected in his work, which resists borders, allowing fiction to bleed into historical events, and follows a trend established for earlier generations by WG Sebald and Olga Tokarczuk. His breakout book, When We Cease to Understand the World, translated by Adrian Nathan West, is about the proximity of genius and madness, incorporating great discoveries and terrifying consequences, from cyanide to black holes: a metaphorical novel about nature’s revenge on human intervention. Dorothy Tse (Hong Kong) Owlish, Tse’s debut novel, and her breakthrough book in English, translated by Natascha Bruce, takes influences from Rushdie to Calvino, from Kafka to Carroll, and chucks them in the blender. It’s a freewheeling, invigorating performance – “a wild ride”, wrote one Bookstagram reader – about a professor named Q who falls for a mechanical ballerina. Beneath the strangeness there’s an exploration of life under repression – “to love the impossible is a form of protest” – which makes Tse’s work both contemporary and timeless. Édouard Louis (France) At the age of 30, Édouard Louis is already well established, having made his name with his debut novel The End of Eddy at the age of 21, which sold 300,000 copies in its first year. His novels tend to be autobiographical: Eddy is about his upbringing amid racism, violence and homophobia; A Woman’s Battles and Transformations is about the “destroyed” first 20 years of his mother’s adulthood. Louis’s work is hard to read at times, but impossible not to admire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/11/labour-opposition-power-keir-starmer-party","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-11T11:03:50Z","webTitle":"Cold, cynical and paranoid: if this is Labour in opposition, what will it look like in power? | John Harris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/labour-opposition-power-keir-starmer-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/labour-opposition-power-keir-starmer-party","fields":{"bodyText":"On both the right and left of the Labour party, one article of faith has always seemed to be set in stone: the idea that you can pursue progressive dreams using no end of skulduggery and nastiness, and never worry about the contradictions. Whether they have been Blairites, Brownites, disciples of Jeremy Corbyn or servants of Keir Starmer, a certain kind of Labour high-up has always thrived on a loathing and mistrust of their internal enemies, and a drive to seize control of the party machine. What this entails is always the same: manic apparatchiks – men, usually – stalking around party offices, desperately trying to fix the selections of parliamentary candidates, and dispensing off-the-record briefings about whichever figures are deemed ready for liquidation. But on this score, as Boris Johnson causes yet more Tory chaos and Labour’s chances of leading the next government solidify, the current leader and his team seem to be in a league of their own. First came the withdrawal of the Labour whip from Corbyn. Just over a week ago, Jamie Driscoll, the elected mayor of the North of Tyne area, was kept out of the running to lead the new north-east region, with no official notification of why, or any right of appeal (the reason given to the media is his appearance at an arts event alongside the film director Ken Loach, expelled from the party because of his membership of the proscribed organisation Labour Against the Witchhunt, which claimed that allegations of Labour antisemitism were “politically motivated”). For the past year, meanwhile, less high-profile stories have been piling up about exclusions from parliamentary shortlists and meddling in local parties. As evidenced by the Driscoll and Corbyn cases, the people around Starmer often frame what they are doing in terms of rooting out antisemitism. But they also fill their “due diligence” charge-sheets with an array of other alleged transgressions. In doing so, they not only cheapen their case, but point to one inescapable conclusion: that what is going on is also about squashing anything and anyone deemed either too leftwing or in any way disobedient. There is no inconsistency in supporting Labour’s newfound intolerance of anti-Jewish prejudice, while also wondering why unrelated – and completely trifling – accusations are also cited, again and again, and boggling at a party so neglectful of both due process and consistent standards. Behaviour flagged as problematic has included liking tweets by the former Labour policy chief Andrew Fisher and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, and giving an online thumbs up to the Occupy movement, which faded away a decade ago. In Milton Keynes, the reasons given by the party for excluding a would-be parliamentary candidate included liking one tweet by Nicola Sturgeon saying the Scottish first minister had recovered from Covid-19, and another that called Starmer a “prat”. A newly recruited Labour activist in the Cornish seat of Camborne and Redruth was contacted about past tweets expressing favourable opinions about senior Green party politicians – and not just ruled out of the local candidate selection process, but expelled from the party (“Kafkaesque insanity,” she said, not unreasonably). For others, whatever the talk from party insiders about the need for “competent and professional” candidates, there have been only the lightest slaps on the wrist: the white leader of Barking and Dagenham council, Darren Rodwell, joked at a black history event that he had the “worst tan possible for a black man”, but remained on a local parliamentary shortlist after being cleared of any wrongdoing, and is now a confirmed Labour candidate, recently heard suggesting that people should be evicted from social housing if their children do not inform on people who commit knife crime. Now, as looming boundary changes entail a new burst of selection contests, the stories are multiplying. In south Wales, for example, two sitting MPs had to recently undergo a selection contest for a new constituency spanning the current seats of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and Cynon Valley. The result was nothing if not predictable: Starmer’s shadow Wales minister, Gerald Jones, defeated the leftwinger Beth Winter, who says the contest was “bulldozed” through in a fortnight, with no in-person hustings. Like Driscoll, she says she will be “taking advice and soundings in the days ahead about my next steps”, but the machine grinds on. Beyond the eternal battle between Labour’s right and left, the other thing that seems to incur the wrath of people at the top is members and activists being friendly towards other parties. In the Cherwell district of Oxfordshire, the results of May’s council elections meant that the local Labour party could have formed a coalition with the Lib Dems, Greens and local independents, but negotiations apparently fell apart after an intervention by the party’s national executive committee, handing power to a minority Tory administration. In the home counties borough of Hertsmere, meanwhile, the local party is still awaiting the NEC’s decision on whether or not to approve its deal with the Lib Dems, while Labour’s regional office has suspended two local activists from paid jobs in the party organisation, and withdrawn the party membership of two others. Their alleged crime, which they strenuously deny, is organising an “unauthorised electoral pact” with another party – in other words, trying to maximise Tory losses. In Westminster, there is one other element of the leadership’s behaviour: a briefing culture whose toxicity is increasing fast. Recent targets of Labour’s whisperers have included the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, her cabinet colleague Ed Miliband and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. “Whenever I go out there with something positive, the negative Westminster briefing machine somehow flicks into gear,” says Burnham. Many Labour people seem to be miserably keeping their heads down, in case they, too, come to the attention of people who could yet bring their political careers to an abrupt end. It all feels like the opposite of the collective determination and excitement that ought to be cohering as the next election approaches, and prompts one obvious question: if things are this ugly when Labour is in opposition, what will happen if it actually takes power? When he ran for leader, Starmer claimed to believe in exactly the kind of politics that he and his people now appear to be set on destroying. He wanted, he said, to nationalise utilities, scrap tuition fees and put up income tax for high earners; at around the same time, he was filmed assuring Driscoll that he wanted to “unify the party”, stop its factions “taking lumps out of each other” and create “an environment in which people can respectfully disagree and come together”. It is hard to keep up with someone so surreally changeable. But he and his people seem to think they can act with complete impunity, on the basis that anyone who wants a change of government will soon have to put their X in the usual box. Put another way, it is only our crooked electoral system that endows Labour with its political monopoly, and gives the fixers and apparatchiks their power. A lot of people in the party seem to understand that – which is part of the reason why last year’s Labour conference voted to transform politics by embracing proportional representation. Starmer and his people, as you may recall, indicated that the decision would be ignored, and returned to the business at hand: command, control, and a kind of power so cold and cynical that you sometimes wonder if it has any content at all.

More than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, plan to strike in February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal. Unite union has accused Drax of “classic corporate greed”, citing an increase in its profits, which jumped to £200m in the first half of its financial year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, helped by high electricity prices. Unite said it had rejected an 8% pay rise and noted that the retail prices index (RPI) inflation rate was 13.4% in December. The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “This is a classic case of greed by a company which is already generating eye-watering profits. Drax is cynically seeking to boost its bonanza profits further by forcing workers to take a real-terms pay cut. “Unite is now totally focused on the jobs, pay and conditions of its members and the workers at Drax will be receiving the union’s complete support.” Unite claimed strike action would shut down Drax – which supplies about 6% of Great Britain’s power at times – and cause power cuts. The company refuted this claim and said it had “robust plans in place to ensure the power station continues to safely generate renewable electricity for millions of homes and businesses” in the event of industrial action. A Drax spokesperson said: “We are deeply disappointed that Unite is planning to go forward with this unnecessary action which will see colleagues lose money instead of securing a significant pay rise. Drax remains open to dialogue with Unite to avoid industrial action. “There are three trade unions representing colleagues at Drax power station and this offer has been accepted by Prospect, while GMB has stated it will not be taking industrial action.” Drax, which has faced criticism over its use of biomass, said it had offered employees £2,000 each in recognition of their work extending the life of two coal units until March 2023. The units have been kept on standby at the request of National Grid. The strikes at Drax are due to take place on 20 and 27 February; 6, 13, 20 and 27 March; and 4, 10 and 17 April. The dispute echoes a standoff at UK Power Networks (UKPN), which supplies power to London and the south-east of England. Unite said on Monday said that 1,300 workers at the company would be balloted for strike action as they were unhappy with a pay rise of 7% for the current financial year. Unite has previously accused UKPN and other networks of “rampant profiteering”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/07/there-are-lessons-in-south-africas-historic-referendum-we-have-the-power-to-change-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-06T20:00:00Z","webTitle":"There are lessons in South Africa’s historic referendum.

Nelson Mandela had been released from Robben Island after almost three decades, exiles were beginning to return, and political negotiations had begun to determine how decades of white minority rule would be ended without a massive loss of life. Those negotiations were tense and difficult, continually undermined by rightwingers who were hellbent on holding on to apartheid. Each time there was progress, the Conservative party and a range of white supremacist groups would question the authority and the legitimacy of FW de Klerk, the then president of the country. They caricatured him as an elitist, arguing that “ordinary” white people – those working on farms and far away from the big cities – had not been consulted on these changes. They insisted that De Klerk was acting on his personal beliefs, but had no mandate to negotiate away white minority rule. In order to address these charges, De Klerk decided to hold a referendum, in which he would ask white South Africans whether they gave his government permission to continue on the path of ending apartheid. The question white voters had to decide on was: “Do you support the continuation of the reform process that the state president started on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?” The stakes were high. De Klerk needed the space to negotiate with the African National Congress (ANC) and other liberation forces in good faith. If he won, and the country voted “yes,” De Klerk would neutralise his rightwing opponents and be free to sit at the table and work out the details of a new constitution. On the other hand, if he lost on the basis of the “no” campaign winning, De Klerk promised he would resign as president and new elections would be called. The ANC was in a difficult position. A whites-only vote flew in the face of the principles it had fought for since it was founded in 1912. Asking white people to vote to determine the future of a Black population that did not have the right to vote felt counterintuitive and morally questionable. And yet, as Mandela and others argued, a “no” vote would reverse the entire negotiation process and plunge the country into chaos. If Black and white could not sit at a table and craft a new future together, they would be forced to do battle in the streets. The time had come for change, and the choices were stark. Even racists recognised that white minority rule was no longer tenable. And so, a broad coalition of future-minded realists began the task of campaigning hard for a “yes” vote. Big business, including companies like Standard Bank, Anglo American and others, formed an alliance and supported the yes campaign. They took out ads in the papers arguing that after years of international condemnation, since Mandela’s release in February 1991, capital was finally flowing back into the country and sanctions were being lifted. A “No” vote would threaten these gains. Their arguments were reinforced by the international community, which made it clear that if white South Africans voted “yes,” the remaining economic and sporting sanctions would fall away almost immediately. If they wanted to turn back the clock and cling to their ways, the world would respond accordingly. In March 1992, the results of the referendum were made public. White people had voted yes, giving De Klerk the mandate to go back to the negotiating table with Mandela. A mere two years later, South Africans of all races voted in a historic set of elections. That jubilant day would not have been possible without that yes campaign. White South Africans who voted “yes” did so for many reasons. Some did it out of a sense of human connection, others for more pragmatic reasons – a South Africa shackled to its past would never address the massive problems of Black unemployment and poverty. Regardless of their reasons, the outcomes were undeniably positive. A single sentence allowed the country to move on to address much bigger systemic problems. South Africa is not a perfect country, but its story of transition offers many lessons. And yes, there are many differences, but the similarities between my home country and the one in which I now live, are too obvious to dismiss. In October this year, a largely non-Indigenous electorate will vote on an amendment to the Australian constitution that has profound implications for the relationship Indigenous people have with the state. This is precisely what was at stake – in dramatic form – in South Africa. Thirty years ago, as a young woman, I raged against the notion that white people held my future in their hands. I found the idea appalling. Over time, I have come to realise how wrong I was. The power to change South Africa was never in white hands. The power to shift the conversation lay in the hands of all those who understood the necessity of change. The power to change South Africa lay with Black South Africans and their allies, who were the architects of the soaring constitution that remains an inspiration to so many today. Voting Yes affirms this country’s willingness to recognise – permanently and irrevocably – that what was done to Aboriginal people cannot be addressed in piecemeal and ad hoc ways that are subject to the whims of politicians. At the moment there is much attention focused on those who scream “no” when all around them others are quietly saying yes. Voting “yes” offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to prove that the voices of the naysayers may be loud, but their numbers are smaller than we might imagine.

It might be an understandable revenge fantasy but this sci-fi – based on Naomi Alderman’s 2016 Margaret Atwood-endorsed novel and starring Toni Collette – suggests what such a world might look like. The power in question is electricity: teenage girls discover they have the ability to unleash deadly bolts from their hands. There are tentative explorations (starting fires, turning on lightbulbs) then escalations – two girls shut down a city’s energy grid. But where will this end? After all, power corrupts. The show initially struggles to establish a tone, but the premise is interesting enough to make it worth sticking with. Prime Video, from Friday 31 March *** Rabbit Hole Kiefer Sutherland rolls back the years in this new thriller, playing John Weir, a similarly hyper-efficient, high stakes operative to 24’s Jack Bauer, and working in the comparably perilous world of corporate espionage sabotage. As we join Weir, he’s smugly decimating the fortune of a passing tech investor before engaging in no-strings sex with a woman he meets in a bar. But though he’s cagey, unattached and enigmatic, he’s leaving trails: soon he’s in the crosshairs of a mysterious operation intent on destroying his livelihood and framing him for murder. It’s slick, slightly generic and enjoyably nasty. Paramount+, from Monday 27 March *** The Big Door Prize Would you live your life differently if you fully understood your true potential? When a mysterious machine appears in the convenience store of a small US town promising to reveal every individual’s capabilities, the locals are seduced. They’re soon buying themselves the motorbike they’ve always fancied, learning judo and taking up artistic hobbies. At the heart of the action is Chris O’Dowd’s gently bumbling teacher Dusty, who is worried about the machine’s potential to unbalance previously tranquil lives. A slow burn but the intrigue ramps up. Apple TV+, from Wednesday 29 March *** Kindred Explorations of US racial faultlines via the medium of fantasy has become a mini-genre in recent years (think 2020’s Lovecraft Country). This feels like a slightly baggy addition to that canon. Adapted from Octavia E Butler’s 1979 novel, Kindred tells the story of writer Dana (Mallori Johnson) whose nightmares about living during the era of slavery start to become so horribly real they resemble time travel. When her white boyfriend Kevin finds himself in this parallel universe too, the potential for troubling allegory is rich. Disney+, from Wednesday 29 March *** Wellmania Adapted from Brigid Delaney’s 2017 novel, this comedy-drama stars Celeste Barber as Liv Healy, a deeply unhealthy Australian food blogger who is denied a US green card on the grounds of unfitness. Via a mixture of gross-out comedy and snarky scepticism, it tracks her journey through various wellness fads as she attempts to reclaim her career. However, in an awkward – albeit predictable – tonal shift towards earnest, feelgood redemption, it turns out her problems aren’t just physical; she’s going to have to address difficult emotional issues, too. Netflix, from Wednesday 29 March *** Unseen A simple premise for this intriguing South African crime thriller: Zenzi Mwale (Gail Mabalane) is a timid cleaner whose husband is being released from prison. When she arrives to pick him up, she is told that he’s already gone. But where? And, more importantly, why? Initially, Zenzi struggles to be taken seriously by either the authorities – to whom she first turns – or the criminal underworld where her focus inevitably shifts. But just because she’s quiet, that doesn’t mean she’s going to give up. Eventually, her quest takes her into dangerous realms.

This is, sadly, an unrealistic expectation if one simply looks at the likely impact on infrastructure of even a limited nuclear attack on the UK, based on exercises and analysis conducted during the cold war. It was accepted 50 years ago that nobody above ground is likely to be left fit or alive to generate power or supply clean water. Food cannot be grown in a radioactive environment and, in the period preceding any outbreak of war, there will be diminished food stocks due to panic buying or rationing. The scenarios modelled by civil defence analysts even during the 1980s Pershing and cruise missile deployment suggested that survival in Britain’s local government bunkers would be short lived. There was never any provision in the UK for sheltering the civilian population in the event of a nuclear conflict and Britain’s civil defence posture was abandoned as a posture after the 1960s. While in neutral Sweden and Switzerland housebuilding rules made provision to protect the civil population, in Britain the idea of being able to survive to the same extent as in, say, the blitz in the second world war is merely a pious hope.

Some time in the early 2030s, Australia will take possession of its first nuclear-powered submarines. Then, around a decade later, we hope to deliver the very first nuclear-powered sub built on home soil. It’s being described as a “new dawn” for defence policy and the journey is under way as Anthony Albanese meets Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak in San Diego. We’ve got full coverage of the announcement, and the reaction to this huge, expensive and globally consequential deal. Back home, Indigenous leaders have voiced some sharp criticisms of opponents of the voice to parliament. And bank shares could come under pressure as the fallout from the biggest financial collapse since 2008 continues. Australia ‘White saviours’ | Conservatives raising doubts about the voice to parliament have been accused of deliberately finding flaws with the proposal “just to stay in the spotlight”, according to a member of the government’s advisory group (pictured). Another group member, Prof Marcia Langton, called it a “relentless scare campaign”. Aukus pact | Australian taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars as the prime minister prepares to announce the new Aukus submarine deal with the US and UK in San Diego this morning. It will mean a “substantial” spending commitment over decades – Peter Dutton thinks it should come from NDIS cuts – and will also involve more “rotational” visits to Australia by US and UK submarines. The UK is itself getting Aukus subs, which should hit the water by the end of the 2030s. Here’s an explainer on all you need to know. Emissions push | Independent MPs Allegra Spender and Zali Steggall are pushing the government to include an absolute cap or an explicit objective that emissions must come down under the safeguard mechanism. Plastic plan | Thousands of tonnes of soft plastic that was collected and dropped off by supermarket customers and has been stockpiled since the collapse of a domestic recycling program could be be shipped to the US for processing. ‘It’s over’ | Conservationists are confident that a five-year hunt for the remaining feral fox in the Pilliga Scrub area of New South Wales – nicknamed Rambo – has ended in its death, paving the way for the greater bilby to flourish again. World China ‘irreversible’ | Xi Jinping has placed the issue of Taiwan at the centre of his third term in office and appeared to be asserting China’s “irreversible” role on the global stage in a speech in Beijing. Ukraine struggle | Amid reports that Xi will start cementing that role with a visit to Russia as early as next week, Kremlin forces are still locked in a brutal struggle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Paper problem | All toilet paper from across the globe checked for toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” contained the compounds, with the waste probably creating a significant source of water pollution, according to research. Attenborough warning | Sir David Attenborough has warned that “nature is in crisis” and is being destroyed at a “terrifying rate”, but said the world had the solutions to solve the problem. ‘Surreal few days’ | Football fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief after the BBC and Gary Lineker agreed that the star presenter would return to present Match of the Day following his suspension for an anti-government tweet. But the row could still see Tory-supporting BBC chair Richard Sharp forced to quit. Full Story Israel, the West Bank and a week of rampage Escalating violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is happening amid unprecedented anti-government protests. It’s no coincidence, reports Bethan McKernan. In-depth Australian banking shares are likely to come under pressure today as financial stocks in the US and Europe fell sharply again in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which has now been bought by HSBC for £1. Interest rates could stop rising sooner than thought because of the crisis, economists have said, with the US Fed already believed to be considering moderating its next expected hike to protect the markets. Here’s an explainer to help understand what’s going on, while our US columnist Robert Reich thinks deregulation is to blame.

But as he goes into his final quarter as boss of the AFL, Gillon McLachlan faces one of the game’s biggest ever threats as the complainants in the Hawthorn racism demand a reckoning. As Jonathan Horn observes wryly, with two days before the season’s first bounce, the suave McLachlan probably didn’t have “undertaking decolonisation” on his final to-do list. The world of sport Cricket | Australia have lost four Test series in a row against India after the fourth Test in Ahmedabad was drawn. They have an early chance for revenge in the world championship final in England in June, and their tenacity in India might prove decisive. Baseball | Australia have made history by reaching the World Baseball Classic quarter-finals for the first time after beating the Czech Republic in Tokyo.

Two units at Drax in Yorkshire and one at West Burton in Nottinghamshire were asked to fire up just before midnight on Wednesday. The West Burton unit was stood down at 5.13am, and the Drax units were later also informed they would not be called into action. It was the third time in a week that the National Grid’s Electricity Supply Operator (ESO) had asked coal-fired stations to warm up in case they were necessary. The units have been placed on standby as a contingency plan amid fears over blackouts this winter. National Grid has been active in balancing the UK’s energy supplies in recent days as it copes with colder, less windy weather, which pushes up energy use and causes power generation from wind to drop. However, the ESO said the latest warm-up instruction was not a response to the recent UK cold snap. Instead it came after the French grid operator RTE said assistance may be required after it was informed of strike action affecting electricity generation on Thursday that “could place their network in an alert status”. It was later decided they were no longer needed “following analysis of network margins”. Britain’s electricity supplies are connected to France through subsea interconnector cables, which allow power to flow between the countries when there is demand. The ESO said the coal plants would have been available to help generate power for France only if they were not needed to prevent power cuts in Great Britain. National Grid has also been running its demand flexibility service for the first time this month outside trials. The service involves energy suppliers paying some households with smart meters for energy reductions, helping to reduce peak demand, which means it has less need to draw on more polluting energy sources when energy use rises in the evenings. Some businesses were already paid to reduce energy use. In total, National Grid is expected to pay just over £3m to suppliers for the service on two days this week, with about £850,000 on Monday and £2.1m for the longer session on Tuesday. In the future, the service is likely to be much more widespread and electric cars and home batteries will play an increasing role in balancing the grid. Drax, the owner of the Yorkshire units, and West Burton, which is owned by France’s EDF, agreed in the summer to extend the lives of their coal-fired generation units through the winter in exchange for fees as the UK government looked to shore up energy supplies after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The two plants had been due to close their coal operations in the autumn to reduce use of the more polluting fuel, but Drax and EDF agreed to keep them open until at least March if needed by National Grid. An ESO spokesperson said: “In support of mutual co-operation between Great Britain and its neighbouring electricity networks the ESO answered France’s request for additional GB generation to be able to provide assistance today if required by warming the contingency coal units. “The ESO was able to take this action to support the French network in avoiding consumer disconnections, as the GB network is currently operating as normal and this action would not have placed GB consumers at risk. Following further assessment of network margins in both countries the ESO has now stood down these coal units.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/02/labour-plans-overhaul-of-jobseeking-with-more-power-for-councils","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T14:00:17Z","webTitle":"Labour plans overhaul of jobseeking with more power for councils","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/02/labour-plans-overhaul-of-jobseeking-with-more-power-for-councils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/02/labour-plans-overhaul-of-jobseeking-with-more-power-for-councils","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour is planning a radical overhaul of jobseeking in the UK by promising to hand major powers to local authorities and turning jobcentres into hubs for skills training and advice for would-be entrepreneurs. The party is also considering allowing universal credit claimants to undertake far more comprehensive programmes of study and training opportunities while continuing to claim benefits. The policy is likely to be adopted based on two key reports by Gordon Brown and David Blunkett, which will the building blocks for Labour’s manifesto offer. Alison McGovern, the shadow employment minister, said there was very little engagement from the Department for Work and Pensions about how jobcentres could match the local skills needed, and that local authorities were best placed to overhaul what employment support was on offer. “To grow our economy, every place needs an economic plan. We want to grow the economy across the country and make sure everybody feels the benefit. You cannot do that without local places being in the lead,” McGovern said. “At the moment, too much of DWP’s policy is made in a high-handed way from Whitehall, whereas we want to learn the lesson from the places that do it best and make sure every place has a really good plan for jobs for all its people.” Brown’s Commission on the UK’s Future said the devolution of Jobcentre Plus should mean they become a hub for local employers – open to those looking to upskill, re-enter the workplace later in life or after childcare responsibilities, or start businesses and resources for civil society, trade union and private sector support. It said that health services should have closer connections to job support and they should be data hubs for local market information. Blunkett’s learning and skills report also recommends funding people to study with agreed providers and that the DWP “should allow people to study full or part-time, whilst on benefits for an agreed course”. Under the current system, there are limits on the ability of people to train and study and continue to receive universal credit. Many experts have cited the requirement for people to spend a minimum amount of time each week looking for work, which limits the ability for full-time skills training or study. A study by the Work Foundation this year found many universal credit claimants voicing frustration that they were not being signposted to adequate training to allow them to build long-term careers in sectors. In cases where people were able to undertake part-time training, most of those cited in the study said they were still having to spend between 16 and 35 hours each week looking for work so they could keep receiving benefits. McGovern, the MP for Wirral South, said that it was self-evidently wrong that people were being penalised for wanted to improve their skills. She said that top-down scripts delivered to work coaches from Whitehall would never be flexible enough to match local skills gaps or help people into long-term skilled jobs. “My frustration is that DWP doesn’t engage in the conversations at all about the big initiatives that are happening between councils, skills centres or big developers. All their policies are set by Whitehall. The conversations people have with work coaches are all driven by Westminster,” she said. McGovern, a former Southwark councillor, said councils were often already building their own initiatives to try to bridge the gap locally. “It’s not the jobcentre sitting with skills centres or employers working out who might fit where. Southwark council have created a whole new body – Southwark Works – to backfill what DWP should be doing. “We should empower local authorities to look at what the opportunities are – every sector has labour shortages – and let towns and cities work it out.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T05:00:00Z","webTitle":"US ranking on abuse of power index hurt by inequality and violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2023/feb/17/us-ranking-on-abuse-of-power-index-hurt-by-inequality-and-violence","fields":{"bodyText":"The US scores surprisingly badly in a new ranking system charting abuses of power by nation states, launched by a group co-chaired by former UK foreign secretary David Miliband. The US comes close to the median of 163 countries ranked in the Index of Impunity, reflecting a poor record on discrimination, inequality and access to democracy. The country’s arms exports and record of violence are an even bigger negative factor. The US ranks worse on impunity than Hungary and Singapore, one a poster child for democratic backsliding and the other an illiberal democracy. The UK performs creditably at 147, only 26 rankings away from the most accountable state. Its score is brought down by its protection of offshore tax havens that facilitate tax abuse in other countries. Former colonies, many affected by the slave trade, fare poorly in the index, suggesting the experience of imperialist subjection has caused a continuing damaging legacy. Nearly all of the top 20 ranked in the index in terms of impunity are former colonies or touched by colonialism. The findings are likely to stimulate the already fraught questioning of the presumed superiority of the west, an issue that bedevils debate at the UN and has come to dampen some of the expected support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. But the index will provide little ammunition for Russia, which ranks 28 out of 160 states, the highest level of impunity in its region, and the result of poor scores for conflict and violence, environmental degradation, abuse of human rights and unaccountable governance. China also performs poorly, at number 48. The work, launched ahead of the Munich Security Conference, has been prepared by an international group co-chaired by Miliband, the former British foreign secretary, and Prof Mónica Pinto of the University of Buenos Aires in collaboration between the Eurasia Group and the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. The authors say the concept of impunity is the exercise of power without accountability, which becomes, in starkest form, the commission of crimes without punishment. The report says: “There are good grounds to fear we are entering a global ‘age of impunity’, in which ‘the rules are for suckers and civilians pay the price’.” It argues that “while the impunity of invading a neighbour or bombing a hospital, contrary to international law, is not yet normalized, the abuse of power is increasingly evident: climate change on the march; autocrats on the rise; and the rules-based-order in retreat. The documentation of the scale of that abuse, in each country in the world, is the purpose of this index.” The authors argue their chosen analytical frame could be a better way of understanding and measuring what is happening in the world today than democracy v autocracy, left v right, or east v west. The authors say it aims to capture the multidimensional nature of global challenges ranged across five main dimensions - governance and human rights, economic inequality, environmental damage, adherence to norms in times of conflict, and the linkages between a country’s domestic politics and its impact abroad. For each of the five dimensions, the authors examined up to 17 different independent credible datasets to measure impunity across each dimension, so making it possible to produce an overall score and ranking for each country in the world. Among the most powerful countries in the international system, Germany and Japan perform the best, benefiting from their lack of direct involvement in the types of conflicts that hurt the scores of more militarised powers, including the US and Russia. Broadly, high income liberal democracies perform well with Nordic countries Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway scoring the best rankings in the index. Environmental degradation is where impunity continues to thrive, even among otherwise accountable societies. For instance Canada, which is one of the best performing countries overall on the index at 22, is in the top quartile of countries for environmental degradation. The study implicitly challenges the framework of democracy versus autocracy set by the US president, Joe Biden, through his democracy summit last year. It argues: “Emphasizing the centrality of democracy alienates the many societies that do not operate under the principles of democratic governance and yet still care about constraining power. It also misses the internal debates over accountability that can happen within both democratic and non-democratic societies.” The index shows, for instance, that countries such as India, Israel, Malaysia, or the US are self-evidently democratic, but do not score well on human rights. Miliband said: “Impunity means the decision to launch a missile attack on a hospital in north-west Syria. It means the decision to prevent the transfer of critical aid into Yemen or within Ethiopia. It means the daily rocket attacks against civilian housing in Ukraine. “Impunity is not just the commission of crimes – which in conflict zones means war crimes – without punishment. It is the exercise of power without checks and balances on the abuse of power. And while the abuse of power in war zones is most extreme, it is not the exception.

Almost 132,000 new cars were sold in the UK in January, up 14% year on year and a sixth consecutive month of growth. The figures mark the best start to the year since 149,279 new cars were sold in January 2020. However, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has reduced its forecast of annual UK new car sales to 1.79m, a 0.8% reduction from its prediction in October, citing a weak economic outlook for this year. Total new UK car sales this year are expected to be up by 11% compared with 2022 – which at 1.6m fell to the lowest level since 1992 – and a further recovery to 1.96m is expected for 2024. The SMMT said the expected growth in UK car sales “bucks the national trend” as businesses and consumers cope with soaring inflation and a run of interest rate rises fuelling a cost of living crisis. “The industry and market are in transition but [is] fragile due to a challenging economic outlook, rising living costs and consumer anxiety over new technology,” the SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said. The latest SMMT snapshot shows that electric vehicle sales continue to underpin overall growth. Sales of hybrid vehicles rose by 40.6% year on year in January, with sales of battery models climbing by a fifth, accounting for 14.4% and 13.1% of all sales respectively. Sales of petrol vehicles rose 14.6% year on year, accounting for 44.7% of all new cars sold in January, while diesel declined by 12%. The 4.3% year on year drop in sales to private buyers shows the increasing economic pressure on household budgets. “Welcome though it is, the surge in sales is partly a case of the market playing catch-up, as manufacturers work through the backlog of orders that were placed, but not fulfilled, last year as supply chain disruption held back the supply of new cars,” the director of AA Cars, Mark Oakley, said. “Looking ahead, the key question for buyer demand will be the extent to which the rising cost of living impacts people’s willingness to commit to big-ticket purchases like a brand new car.” Last month, the SMMT released data that showed total UK vehicle production slumped to a 66-year low in 2022, down almost 10% on 2021 and 40.5% compared with before the pandemic in 2019."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:15:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear powers are on a deadly path to more conflict | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","fields":{"bodyText":"Truly, the human race has a death wish.

The comments come as green groups rally against a key component of the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition: that Australia is required to dispose of the waste generated by its Virginia-class submarines and the new SSN-Aukus submarine. On Tuesday the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, announced that Australia would need a new facility, remote from the population, to dispose of nuclear waste on defence land, whether current or future. “Now to be clear, the first of the naval reactors that we will be disposing of will not happen until the 2050s,” Marles told reporters in Canberra. “But within the year, we will announce a process by which this facility will be identified.” According to defence department documents, the department will work with the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency to undertake a review in 2023 to identify locations “that could be suitable to store and dispose of intermediate-level waste and high-level waste, including spent fuel”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ramsey, whose electorate of Grey covers 908,595 sq km – the majority of South Australia – said he was “amazed” given the 33-year life of the Virginia-class submarine that a waste facility is required as soon as the 2050s. Australia has struggled with the question of where to store its slowly accumulating intermediate nuclear waste for decades. The Morrison government chose a site near the town of Kimba, in Grey, but the local Barngarla people united against the plan. The Albanese government has continued to pursue using the Kimba site. Ramsey said there is “no way” the Kimba site “could, should or would be a repository for high level waste”. “You need 400 metres of solid, dry granite. There are no assessments like that around Kimba, it’s a completely different facility to the one proposed.” Ramsey said defence land near the remote village of Woomera, also in his electorate, “may well be suitable, but so may a lot of other sites” around Australia. “Geographically and geologically Woomera would be fine.” The Australian Conservation Foundation has raised the alarm about Australia housing nuclear waste, with its analyst Dave Sweeney pointing to its “scant real world experience”. “Successive federal governments have searched, without success, for a site for low and intermediate-level waste for more than three decades,” Sweeney said. “This waste remains poisonous and carcinogenic for tens of thousands of years. “Aukus presents by far the biggest threat yet that Australia will become a dumping ground for the world’s worst nuclear waste. “If defence applies its standard, highly secretive approach to the management of this high-level nuclear waste, hundreds of generations of Australians will live with the consequences.” On Tuesday the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, called for a “sensible, mature debate” about nuclear energy, waste and its disposal, urging critics to “grow up”. “We dispose of nuclear waste now in our country … we dispose of it safely,” Dutton told reporters in Canberra. “We’ve got … an incredibly stable environment to store nuclear waste.” Dutton said the Coalition “won’t be playing politics … we will support the government in its decision to deal with the waste”. Asked about housing others’ waste, Marles told ABC TV that managing the nuclear material and reactors powering Australian submarines “is an important part of Australia’s nuclear stewardship and that is all we’re focused on”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/09/national-grid-pays-high-price-for-gas-generated-power-during-uk-cold-snap","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"National Grid pays high price for gas-generated power during UK cold snap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/09/national-grid-pays-high-price-for-gas-generated-power-during-uk-cold-snap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/09/national-grid-pays-high-price-for-gas-generated-power-during-uk-cold-snap","fields":{"bodyText":"National Grid paid some of the highest prices this winter for gas-generated power on Tuesday night as it scrambled to keep the lights on during one of the coldest weeks of the year. Data from the electricity system’s administrator, Elexon, showed the Coryton power station in Essex had bids accepted to produce power at £1,950 per megawatt hour (MWh) on Tuesday evening. The sums are well above average prices of between £200 and £400 per megawatt hour, although they remain below those paid on 12 December, when National Grid paid £27m in a single day to get power stations to crank up supply. In December, Rye House power station in Hertfordshire received a record £6,000 a MWh. In total, the cost of balancing the system on Tuesday this week was estimated at between £5m and £10m. One industry source said the price of sourcing power from gas peaking plants had “raised eyebrows”. The cold, still weather reduced wind power and pushed up demand this week, while strikes at EDF’s nuclear plants in France also put a strain on the grid. To counter this, National Grid called on coal plants that were put on standby for the winter into action for the first time, as well as sourcing power from Dinorwig, a vast, pumped hydroelectric power plant in north Wales nicknamed “Electric Mountain”, which is the fastest source of electricity in the UK. Industry sources said Coryton, owned by InterGen, could have earned as much as £2m on Tuesday but failed to deliver all of the power originally offered up. InterGen was bought by Czech financier Pavel Hubáček’s Creditas investment group in January. National Grid relies on offering the right prices to incentivise power plants to help balance supply and demand. Generators bid to provide power at a specified price. The next highest accepted offers after Coryton were Uniper’s Connah’s Quay power station in north Wales – which received £999 per MWh and Rocksavage Power Station in near Liverpool, also owned by InterGen, which received £750 per MWh. Rye House – owned by VPI, a subsidiary of the Swiss trading multinational Vitol – is understood to have bid £5,750 per MWh but its offer was not accepted. The profits of gas-fired peaking plants – so-called because they tend to be fired up at peak consumption times when other contributors to the grid, such as windfarms, underperform – have been in the spotlight over the winter. Their rates have jumped since the invasion of Ukraine, leading to calls for their profits to be capped. Despite increasing amounts of renewable electricity generation, Britain remains reliant on gas. Ofgem is expected to soon publish proposals designed to prevent backup generators from receiving “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Peaking plant owners argue they provide a rapid source of electricity supplies, and only produce profits sporadically while detractors say they are owned by sophisticated traders maximising returns when the market is tight. National Grid warned last October that Britain could suffer rolling blackouts this winter as Russian gas supplies were turned down after the war in Ukraine. However, mild weather and strong gas storage in Europe have eased those fears. The Grid expects to pay between £220m and £420m to keep five coal units on standby this winter. A spokesperson for InterGen said: “InterGen’s plants provide a crucial function in the energy system by keeping the lights on when demand is high and renewable generation is low. “This flexibility reduces the need for many power stations to run continuously, reducing the overall cost and carbon intensity of the grid.” National Grid and Uniper declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T11:48:39Z","webTitle":"Republicans criticize Biden’s Ukraine trip as Putin pulls out of nuclear arms treaty | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/first-thing-republicans-criticize-bidens-ukraine-trip-as-putin-pulls-out-of-nuclear-arms-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Fiona Hill, who was a Russian specialist at the White House national security council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”.

Biden unveils Trump-style plan to deter asylum seekers at Mexico border The US could bar tens of thousands of people arriving at the US-Mexico border from claiming asylum under a proposal announced yesterday, in what would be the most wide-ranging attempt yet by the Biden administration to deter unauthorized crossings. Under the new rules, the US would generally deny asylum to people who show up at the US southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through, mirroring an attempt by the Trump administration that never took effect because it was blocked in court. The measure, while stopping short of a total ban, imposes severe limitations on asylum for people of any nationality except Mexicans, who do not have to travel through a third country to reach the US. The proposed rule establishes “a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility” for anyone who passes through another country to reach the US border with Mexico without first seeking protection there, according to a notice in the Federal Register. Exceptions will be made for people with an “acute medical emergency”, “imminent and extreme threat” of violent crimes such as murder, rape or kidnapping, being a victim of human trafficking or “other extremely compelling circumstances”. Children traveling alone will also be exempt, according to the rule. What do campaigners plan to do? The measure is almost certain to face legal challenges; Donald Trump pursued a similar ban in 2019 but a federal appeals court prevented it from taking effect. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) vowed to fight the Biden rule in court, likening it to the Trump restriction, which was described as a “transit ban” by activists.

Last year, the US Transport Security Administration (TSA) seized 6,542 guns from people about to board planes at 262 airports – a sixfold increase since 2010. Almost nine in 10 of the weapons were loaded. While most people claimed to forget they even had a gun, others thought that because they had been issued a permit to carry a gun they could carry it anywhere, anytime, Jeffrey Price, an aviation security expert said. Don’t miss this: the sudden dawn of the de-influencer – can online superstars stop us shopping? Social media is now what markets and shopping centres once were – the place people go to spend their cash – full of “must-haves” such as heated eyelash curlers and “miracle” pink cleaning pastes. And when something goes viral online, it sells in real life. Influencers reportedly sold $3.6bnof goods in 2022, with the $700 Dyson Airwrap hair styler among the top sellers. But a backlash against overconsumption is spreading fast. If influencing is trying to convince people on social media to buy certain products, then de-influencing is, very broadly, the opposite. Is this the beginning of the end for our rampant, destructive consumer culture – or just influencing by another name? Climate check: Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending Georgia, a state once known for its peaches and peanuts, is rapidly becoming a crucible of clean energy technology in the US, leading a pack of Republican-led states enjoying a boom in renewables investment that has been accelerated by Biden’s climate agenda. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August, billions of dollars of clean energy investment has been announced for solar, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing in Georgia, pushing it to the forefront of a swath of southern states that are becoming a so-called battery belt in the economic transition away from fossil fuels. Republican-led states have claimed the lion’s share of renewable energy and electric vehicle activity, even though they did not vote for the climate spending.

Solar power generation in June is on track to come within a hair’s breadth of the record set during an unusually sunny May in 2020 at about 20 gigawatt hours, according to Alastair Buckley, the professor of organic electronics at the University of Sheffield. That is perfect timing for the largest solar power industry gathering of the year, at a summit in London this week, and a chance for many to reflect on the resurgence of sunlight in the grid, in the years since the Conservative government brought the industry to its knees by slashing subsidies. More importantly, it will be a chance to look ahead to a new dawn. The solar industry has been easy to underestimate in a country better known for dull drizzly days than blue skies. But it has enjoyed steady growth, is far cheaper than headline-grabbing nuclear investments and far less conspicuous than fields of wind turbines. Solar power made up 4.4% of the UK’s electricity needs in 2022, but the annual figures belie a far greater impact in the summer. Solar regularly accounts for more than 25% of demand when it is producing peak output during the sunnier months. It has also seen a step change in demand due to falling technology costs and a growing desire for cheap, secure energy supplies. Last year, the number of rooftop installations in the UK doubled, according to MCS, an accreditation scheme. It found that a total of 130,596 systems were mounted on UK rooftops in 2022, the same number as in the three previous years combined. In total, the UK has about 15 gigawatts of solar power capacity across the country, according to the industry body Solar Energy UK. The government hopes to increase this to 70GW by 2035. This ambition is not without challenges. Surging demand has led to one of the longest queues for a grid connection in Europe, with many solar developers being told they will have to wait more than a decade. The outcry over delays, which threaten the UK’s solar aims and legally binding climate targets, underlines the appetite for homegrown solar energy. National Grid, which manages the connections process, has begun an urgent review and hopes to ease the gridlock in the coming years. Worldwide, growth in solar is expected to rocket. The International Energy Agency believes the global energy crisis will give way to a boom in spending on affordable, homegrown renewable energy, with solar likely to emerge as the fastest growing source of renewable electricity. Solar power is set to almost triple between 2022 and 2027, to surpass coal as the biggest source of electricity capacity in the world, it said. This year, investment in solar power is likely to eclipse spending on oil production for the first time, the IEA added. The next week’s weather will determine whether June emerges as the solar industry’s latest record-breaking month. At the UK solar summit, energy executives and investors will determine how best to navigate the technology’s enormous growth potential in the long term. For the industry, it’s a sunny forecast ahead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-19T07:45:33Z","webTitle":"‘We have money and power’: older Americans to blockade banks in climate protest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/19/climate-crisis-protest-environment-third-act-bill-mckibben","fields":{"bodyText":"Climate activists across the US will on Tuesday blockade branches of banks that finance fossil fuels, cutting up their credit cards in protest and holding rallies featuring everything from flash mobs to papier-mache orca whales. Unusually for such a spectacle, the protests won’t be led by young activists but those of a grayer hue. The protests, across more than 90 locations, including Washington DC, are billed as the first set of mass climate demonstrations by older Americans, who have until now been far less visible than younger activists, such as the school strike movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg. In a nod to the more seasoned age of participants, older people in painted rocking chairs will block the entrances to some of the US’s largest banks to highlight their funding of oil and gas extraction. “So far the kids have had to do all of the work and they’ve done an amazing job but it’s not fair to ask 18-year-olds to solve this problem,” said Bill McKibben, the veteran climate campaigner who co-founded the Third Act group last year, which is designated for people aged over 60. The group has gathered momentum, attracting more than 50,000 members and recently holding a test-run protest in New York City, where participants marched under a banner reading “fossils against fossil fuels”. “Older people have got money and structural power coming out of our ears,” said McKibben, who is 62. “We have to show young people we have their back. I’m going to be dead before the climate crisis is at its absolute worst, but being nearer the exit than the entrance concentrates one’s mind to notions of legacy and we are the first generation to leave the world in a worse place than we found it. “I understand why people say ‘OK boomer’ – it’s not like we have done an amazing job in protecting the world.” While polling has shown that fears over global heating are most prevalent among younger people, to the extent that some question the wisdom of having children themselves, McKibben said he has found “huge concern” among older people about the climate emergency. “There is a sense people get more conservative as they age but I’m not sure if that’s true of this group of older people,” said McKibben, who pointed out that people in their 70s and 80s now were young people during the cultural upheavals of the 1960s. “The people sitting on rocking chairs on Tuesday were marching on the first Earth Day in 1970,” he said. “We probably all believed that the government would address these concerns – we may have gotten a little complacent.” McKibben said he hoped the protests would highlight the link between “cash in the bank and carbon in the air”. Third Act is encouraging people to sign a pledge to quit Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America if they don’t stop funding fossil fuels. The “big four” are the world’s leading banking financiers of oil and gas projects, despite variously committing to helping address the climate crisis, with a recent report finding they have collectively provided $1.1tn in financing to fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The protests, despite their months of planning, appear to be prescient, coming in the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a leading funder of renewable energy projects, and a growing backlash against investor environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations by rightwing groups and leading Republicans, many themselves funded by fossil fuel interests. The previously bone-dry world of ESG, which is the effort to reduce investor risk to outside threats such as the climate crisis, has found itself thrust firmly into the US culture wars, with the governors of 18 Republican-led states, including the Florida governor and presumed presidential contender Ron DeSantis, last week jointly condemning the “proliferation of ESG throughout America” that is “putting investment decisions in the hands of the woke mob”. DeSantis has, without evidence, blamed the fall of Silicon Valley Bank on its diversity initiatives “and politics and all kinds of stuff”, leading a concerted Republican effort to paint financial institutions as being in thrall to progressive priorities in the form of ESG. Marlo Oaks, the Republican state treasurer of Utah, said last week that ESG was part of “Satan’s plan”. Joe Biden’s first presidential veto is expected to be over the issue of ESG, following a successful attempt by Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would have overturned an administration rule on sustainable investing. Biden’s rule had lifted a ban placed by Donald Trump upon money managers considering ESG and the climate crisis in investment decisions, such as assets that could be damaged by extreme weather, or become unviable in a decarbonized world. The furore over ESG has seen several Republican-led states draft legislation to ban consideration of the climate crisis in investments, despite the party’s previous support for free market economics. The attacks on ESG have been “politically motivated”, according to Amelia Miazad, a law professor and ESG market expert at the University of California, Davis, School of Law. “ESG is about risk management and generating sustainable value but its critics have made it about values, which is easy to attack,” she said. “The anti-ESG movement has just repeated a simple, inaccurate message over and over again. It’s quite remarkable market meddling by so-called free market advocates, telling investors and banks what they can and can’t invest in.” Miazad said that investors were now being “very careful” about mentioning ESG because it had become so politicized, instead favoring terms such as “sustainability”. “There has been a chilling of corporate speech because of this ESG backlash,” she said. “If they are worried about saying the C-word – climate – we are in a far worse place in terms of business norms, public discourse and democracy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T15:00:42Z","webTitle":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 230 residents in Stoke-on-Trent are to launch a class action lawsuit against the city council after they claim they were “mis-sold” 25-year solar power contracts which have left some with faulty panels and unexpected bills.

I signed the iPad and that was it, I never heard anything else from them,” she said. “I had no idea I’d signed up to a 25-year contract until we read a story in the newspaper about them.” She later found out her digital signature had been copied on to three separate documents. “I’m autistic, I was by myself, I didn’t have my partner with me, I just thought it was a council thing. I feel like they took advantage,” said Burton, adding that her solar panels were never hooked up to her electricity supply but she still received bills. “It’s a constant stress. Every single day I’m on the CES community group on Facebook to check what’s happening, what the latest advice is. I won’t let anybody in my house now,” she said. “Who doesn’t want more renewable energy? Who doesn’t want to help the Earth be a better place? But it makes me really angry.” Bibby Thomas, 58, said she specifically asked the salesperson to explain what she was signing when he came to her door in 2019. “He gave me this iPad, and I said: ‘I’m dyslexic, so I can’t read the whole lot. I’m not signing anything that shouldn’t be signing, am I?’ He said no, everything was fine, so I did a squiggle on it.” She claims no one mentioned a 25-year contract. A number of residents are to launch a class action lawsuit against the council and CES over how the scheme was sold to them. In response to concern expressed by customers, CES said they were given the option to keep their existing contract, swap to an updated contract with more user-friendly language and terms, or exit the agreement and switch back to receiving all of their electricity from the grid. The company insists the fact the agreements were for 25 years was stated on the CES website, literature, contracts and by sales teams, and that all tenants received a letter from the council explaining the scheme before being signed up. It also said the majority of tenants received a verification call to check they had been given the information. The Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent city council gave Solarplicity Energy exclusive rights to install the panels on its housing stock, initially handing over the details of more than 1,000 homes it thought would be suitable, in return for £100 for each installation. Solar panels were also installed on empty council house properties, meaning prospective tenants had to sign up to the solar energy scheme as a condition of tenancy. The Stoke-on-Trent Labour councillor Desiree Elliott said the scheme had been “a failure and a scandal from the beginning”. She said: “The company involved has demonstrated time and again that it is not up to delivering a project of this size with any semblance of professionalism.” Residents said they were promised the solar panels would come with batteries, allowing them to store surplus solar energy to use in the evenings and on darker days, but these have only recently started being rolled out. CES said 200 tenant properties have had batteries installed since 2020. In 2019 Solarplicity Energy ceased trading after criticism from Ofgem and the Energy Ombudsman, who received 3,324 complaints about the company, and tenants have been switched to a different supplier, while still remaining part of the 25-year CES contracts. A Stoke-on-Trent city council spokesperson said the scheme was designed to support tenants “in lowering their energy bills and reducing carbon emissions”. “Supporting households to generate more sustainable, cheaper and greener energy is even more significant given the considerable rises in energy prices this winter. It is clearly not appropriate to comment any further on a matter that is subject to legal proceedings.” A spokesperson for CES said: “We have worked hard to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. We’ve listened to concerns raised about the accessibility of language used in our contracts, and we’ve offered tenants the opportunity to make their own choice about how the solar energy being generated on their home is used. “We remain committed to making access to solar as easy and beneficial as possible, and tenants are welcome to contact us if we can provide them with any support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:52:45Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 396 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-396-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, the national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, Putin said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence, Hanna Maliar, went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured after the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jun/03/us-zogg-wildfire-power-company-avoided-trial","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-03T17:00:36Z","webTitle":"The reckoning that wasn’t: how the largest US power firm avoided a trial for a deadly wildfire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/03/us-zogg-wildfire-power-company-avoided-trial","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/03/us-zogg-wildfire-power-company-avoided-trial","fields":{"bodyText":"It was supposed to be a public reckoning. On Tuesday, America’s largest utility was set to go on trial in an effort to hold it accountable for sparking a wildfire that claimed the lives of four people. Family members of the victims of the 2020 Zogg fire planned to face PG&amp;E executives as the company stood trial in a northern California courtroom on manslaughter charges. Instead, Judge Daniel Flynn on Wednesday dismissed the charges and like it has done in so many cases before, PG&amp;E agreed to a multimillion-dollar settlement. The outcome largely marks the end of a chaotic chapter for the company, a behemoth in the energy industry that serves about one of every 20 Americans and nearly half of all Californians. In recent years, PG&amp;E has been defined by the devastating fires linked to its power equipment that have killed dozens across the state, resulting in mass payouts and the threat of criminal consequences, but arguably little reform. The utility did not have to admit wrongdoing as part of the Shasta county deal, a preferable outcome for PG&amp;E, said Steven Weissman, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and former judge at the California public utilities commission. “This has been the modus operandi for all these years to never have to face judgment or face as few judgments as you possibly can,” he said. “This really has been a very successful strategy.” As part of a settlement to avoid a trial, PG&amp;E has agreed to pay $45m to fire prevention and rebuilding efforts in the rural area and a $5m civil penalty, a significant sum in a small, under-resourced county. But no one seems particularly thrilled with the resolution, not family members of the deceased nor the district attorney, Stephanie Bridgett, who hoped to hold PG&amp;E accountable and force change. “This resolution does not make me happy,” said Bridgett, when announcing the settlement. “Taking PG&amp;E to trial and holding them criminally responsible was always our goal – but the tentative ruling changed our position and I am unwilling to gamble with the safety of Shasta county.” For survivors like Wayne King, whose 79-year-old wife, Karin, died as she tried to escape the flames, the settlement was a welcome but unsatisfying outcome. “All the money that PG&amp;E has, all the contributions – that won’t make up for my loss,” said King. ••• PG&amp;E, has faced years of reckoning over its role in California’s wildfire crisis. Between 2017 and 2022, the company set off at least 31 wildfires that wiped away entire towns, burned nearly 1.5m acres and 24,000 structures, and killed 113 people. The company has been accused of repeatedly prioritizing profits over safety, enriching shareholders rather than removing trees that pose a danger to its power lines. More radical efforts to reform PG&amp;E, either by splitting it into multiple companies or a takeover by the state government, have not materialized. PG&amp;E has paid billions of dollars to settle claims from fire victims and pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter in the 2018 Camp fire – sparked when a crumbling piece of equipment, overdue for replacement by decades, cast sparks into the dry Sierra Nevada foothills, creating a fire that killed dozens of people, destroyed about 14,000 homes and leveled the town of Paradise. In the aftermath, it filed for bankruptcy, replaced its CEO several times over and pledged to run a safer company that can supply gas and electricity to millions of Californians without injuring or killing its customers. The company was still dealing with the fallout from the Camp fire when it sparked a new blaze in Shasta and Tehama counties that became known as the Zogg fire. The 2020 disaster started during a windstorm when an ailing gray pine, marked for removal because of its defects, fell on power lines in the rugged mountainous terrain east of Redding. Fueled by fire-friendly conditions, the blaze raced through the tiny towns of Igo and Ono and scattered homes in the foothills, consuming more than 56,000 acres (23,000 hectares), taking out hundreds of homes and forcing people to immediately evacuate. The fire quickly traveled the half mile to the home of animal rights activists Karin King and her husband, Wayne. By the time they got in their vehicles with their dogs, fire was burning on both sides of the only route to safety. Smoke made it so the road was hardly visible at all and Karin, who was driving separately, kept falling behind, Wayne King said in an interview with the Guardian. Wayne would stop and honk and wait for her to catch up and turned around to find her more than once, but as they wound down the last stretch of the winding two-lane road, he was alone. “Karin didn’t come,” he said. Later he’d learn she made it only half a mile past the last spot he saw her. “She ran off into a gully with the car and it burned up and she burned up and the dog burned up and all of our records and all that [was] in the fire resistant safe burned up,” he said. “She was a good woman and I miss her terribly.” Three other people died trying to escape the fire: Alaina Mcleod, 46, and her eight-year-old daughter, Feyla, and Kenneth Vossen, 52, who was badly burned as he sought refuge at a pond on his rural property and later died at a hospital. PG&amp;E was eventually fined $150m by California’s public utility regulator, which alleged that “the tree that caused the fire was not removed in time because of PG&amp;E’s poor recordkeeping”. Bridgett, the district attorney, opted to charge the company, putting an investigator and multiple attorneys on the case. She geared up for a fight against a corporation with substantial resources in order to get justice for the victims and to ensure that PG&amp;E doesn’t “continue the practices that led to the fire in the first place”. From the outset, she says, the imbalance was palpable. “They have a virtually unlimited budget when it comes to their defense,” she said. “They have multiple attorneys present at every court appearance. They have significant resources that a small county DA’s office doesn’t necessarily have.” Still, the case moved forward with a judge finding PG&amp;E should be criminally prosecuted for its role in the fire, and setting the date for a trial in June. The company challenged that ruling and another judge determined the tree falling on company infrastructure did not necessarily mean PG&amp;E had been negligent, a ruling that led to the charges being dropped and the settlement reached. Under the agreement, PG&amp;E will fund fuel mitigation efforts, a scholarship program to increase the number of local firefighters, a large animal evacuation center and memorials to honor those killed in the fire. PG&amp;E must also move some of its infrastructure underground, install new weather monitoring stations and meet regularly with the district attorney’s office to ensure it is complying. “The agreement reflects our continuing commitment to making it right and making it safe. We stand behind our thousands of trained and experienced coworkers and contractors working every day to keep Californians safe,” Patti Poppe, the company’s CEO, said in a statement. Bridgett wanted to see the case go to court, with all the evidence against PG&amp;E made public, but said she’s hopeful about what the agreement means for the county. “We worked hard with them to try to come up with very measurable things they could do and we could have oversight with them. Ultimately, we want them to be in compliance with the law and so that none of their equipment is going to start a fire that kills another person.” ••• Last month at the Igo store, a one-stop shop and bar, residents shared memories of the blaze and how it forever altered life in the tiny woodsy settlements tucked in the foothills, now green and blooming with wildflowers after recent rains. “It was terrifying – plain and simple. We’d lived through a lot of fires up here but never seen anything like that,” said Damon Brazell, 82, a retired sheriff’s deputy who lost his home in the disaster. “It took out the heart of the community. There’s nothing here anymore.” Brazell ruminated over all the fire took as he sat at the bar surrounded by some of his remaining neighbors. Many people didn’t rebuild their homes, he said, and key community gathering places were destroyed. He lost treasured belongings and a property he built. He has a new home, but not one he made with his hands. “It broke my spirit. It gave me a big case of the blues – a sadness I don’t think I’ll get over,” he said. But Brazell, like others at the Igo store, were torn about what would constitute a proper punishment. “How do you hold a corporation accountable? I think it’s kind of fruitless myself.” The money promised in the settlement will help ensure the area’s safety in future fires, King said. The home he shared with Karin survived the fire and he still lives there. He runs into PG&amp;E workers, in the area to remove dead trees, as he goes about his errands – trips to the Igo store for lunch, church and the nearby cemetery where he visits Karin. “I get irritated every month when I get a PG&amp;E bill, but I pay it,” he said. Still, he says, revenge is the last thing he wants. “We were married for 62 years and we had a very good relationship all of our 62 years. I miss her but getting even with PG&amp;E is not in my book,” he said. “Hopefully, they have come to the conclusion they need to do a better job of protecting their lines.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Mind the capability gap: what happens if Collins class submarines retire before nuclear boats are ready?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/28/mind-the-capability-gap-what-happens-if-collins-class-submarines-retire-before-nuclear-boats-are-ready","fields":{"bodyText":"“Every galah in the pet shop is talking about a capability gap”, former defence secretary Dennis Richardson memorably said. Those “galahs” include defence experts, policymakers and industry, who are all fretting about whether Australia will be left vulnerable when the ageing Collins class submarines are retired. The federal government is considering the defence strategic review and advice from the submarine taskforce on acquiring a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, but there are concerns that they will not be in service in time for a seamless handover from the Collins class. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has been sounding increasingly positive that there will be no such gap. “I’m feeling confident about our ability to deal with this,” he told Guardian Australia in January, adding it would be part of “the optimal pathway” to be announced soon. Marles said the government had asked the taskforce to examine “to the extent any capability gap arose how we would meet the capability gap”. “The process has been very focused on that, and I’m confident I’ll have answers to it.” While much of the focus is on submarines, though, experts say a multi-pronged approach could work. Acquiring that fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines is the first “pillar” of the Aukus partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, but the second pillar, which includes hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence and underwater drones, will be needed in the short term. It will be at least a decade before even the first submarine is delivered and some estimates even push the timeline out to 2050. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to meet with both the US president, Joe Biden, and the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in the US in March, to announce the governments’ plans. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Marles has emphasised the “genuinely trilateral” nature of the Aukus agreement between the three countries, leading to speculation a new hybrid submarine to replace the ageing Colins class fleet will be built using elements of both the US and the UK’s boats. The life of the Collins fleet will be stretched out as much as possible with life-of-type extensions, but the boats are still set to be retired by the end of the next decade. Marles told the ABC late last year that the Labor government had “inherited” a situation where the first submarine would not be in the water until the 2040s. “We need to be looking at how we can get that sooner,” he said. When former prime minister Scott Morrison announced he was scrapping the deal with France to build 12 boats in favour of the Aukus deal to build “at least” eight submarines in South Australia in 2021, he also announced plans to acquire various missiles, including hypersonic and precision strike guided missiles over the next decade. On top of the missiles, there is a second pillar of Aukus that includes working with the UK and the UK on underwater drones, quantum technology, artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, advanced cyber capabilities, electronic warfare, and other innovations. Those technologies are expected to help Australia in the context of increasing aggression from China while it waits for the submarines. Earlier this year, US senators warned Biden not to sell Australia any submarines, arguing the US did not have the industrial capability to spare any, which dashed hopes of getting any of those submarines earlier. Foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre, Tom Corben, said that “wouldn’t be news” to policymakers in the US or Australia. “When congressmen or senior leaders in the US say the shipbuilding base is maxed out, they’re not lying,” he said. “It’s been like that for a number of years now.” He said Marles had made it clear the project would be trilateral, which suggests Australia will not rely on the US and that instead the work would be split between nations. Corben said there could be “really creative solutions” found, but that it was important to remember the submarines are only one part of Aukus. “They’re pillar one of two pillars,” he said. While submarines are the “backbone” of the maritime force structure, Corben said he wouldn’t be surprised if the imminent announcement also contained more details on the second pillar. “Marles has emphasised that Australia is particularly interested in any capability through pillar two that would arrive in the next five years,” he said. “We’re in a bit of a dangerous window of time in terms of our collective ability to resist Chinese military incursion. The submarines won’t really help in that window, they’re more of a long-term [proposition]. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more detail on the other elements that are going to be required.” In a statement last year, the White House said the Aukus partners had made “strong progress” on the advanced capabilities. Trials of autonomous vehicles are set to begin this year, it said, and trials of quantum technologies for position, navigation and timing, would happen over the next three years. Work had already started on autonomous and artificial intelligence-enabled systems to improve the speed and precision of decision-making processes, while the three countries were also strengthening their defences against cyber-attacks, sharing information on electronic warfare, developing advanced hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities. The director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, said there were other capabilities Australia could buy that could do “similar things” to submarines – such as sinking ships. “One area we’re already getting into is mine warfare,” he said. “But we’re also investing in anti-ship missiles that can be fired from the air and we’re even getting some land-based missile capability.” Other options that have been floated include building entirely new air warfare destroyers equipped with more than 100 missile launching cells, in order to bolster firepower, or building an interim conventional submarine. But Roggeveen warned that China’s anti-ship ballistic missiles made surface ships vulnerable. And Marles has appeared to dismiss the idea of interim submarines. “There are no plans for any conventional – conventionally powered interim submarine capability, as we move towards gaining the nuclear-powered submarine capability,” he said in January. In a statement to parliament on 9 Febuary, Marles emphasised the importance of the second pillar. “These capabilities will help us hold potential adversaries’ forces at risk, at a greater distance and increase the cost of aggression against Australia and its interests.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-06T05:51:05Z","webTitle":"US senators urge Joe Biden not to sell ‘scarce’ nuclear submarines to Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/06/us-senators-urge-joe-biden-not-to-sell-scarce-nuclear-submarines-to-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"Two top US senators have urged president Joe Biden not to sell nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, warning it would diminish US national security given the vessels are “scarce”. The intervention confirms the US is under pressure not to sell its submarines before Australia is able to build its own as part of the Aukus alliance – meaning it could be decades before Australia gains nuclear submarines. A spokesperson for the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, played down the leak, saying “the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines is taking shape, and an announcement remains on track to be made in the first part of this year.” The Australian government is due to announce whether it plans to buy nuclear submarines from the US or UK by March. According to US news site Breaking Defense, the Democratic senator Jack Reed, chair of the US Senate armed services committee, and the then ranking Republican senator James Inhofe, now retired, sent Biden the letter in December. Reed and Inhofe wrote that “over the past year, we have grown more concerned about the state of the US submarine industrial base as well as its ability to support the desired Aukus SSN [nuclear submarine] end state.” “We believe current conditions require a sober assessment of the facts to avoid stressing the US submarine industrial base to the breaking point,” they reportedly wrote. “We are concerned that what was initially touted as a ‘do no harm’ opportunity to support Australia and the United Kingdom and build long-term competitive advantages for the US and its Pacific Allies, may be turning into a zero-sum game for scarce, highly advanced US [Virginia-class submarines].” “We urge you to adopt a ‘do no harm’ approach to Aukus negotiations and ensure that sovereign US national security capabilities will not be diminished as we work to build this strategic partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom over the coming decades.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US aims to build its own fleet of at least 60 nuclear-powered submarines but is struggling to meet its own needs. In December the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, recommitted the Biden administration “to ensuring that Australia acquires this capability [nuclear submarines] at the earliest possible date”. But the two senators reportedly noted “just 1.2 Virginia-class [nuclear submarines] have been delivered, on average, per year over the past five years”. Selling or transferring Virginia-class submarines prior to meeting the US navy’s requirements would make it “less capable of meeting sovereign wartime and peacetime requirements”, they wrote. “Make no mistake, we recognise the strategic value of having one of our closest allies operating a world-class nuclear navy could provide in managing long-term competition with an increasingly militaristic China. “However, such a goal will take decades to achieve, and we cannot simply ignore contemporary realities in the meantime.” Marles’s spokesperson said Aukus would “significantly transform Australia’s strategic posture and the work undertaken over the last 16 months speaks to a shared mission between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States”. Australia was “grateful” for the US and UK enabling Australia to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine capability and “that important capability is not lost on us”, the spokesperson said. In September 2021, Australia tore up a $90bn conventional submarine contract with France to instead acquire nuclear submarine technology from the US or the UK as part of the new Aukus alliance. The deal created a looming capability gap, requiring the Collins-class submarines to be upgraded and their life extended until the first nuclear-propelled submarines could be made in Australia by the late 2030s. In June, Peter Dutton, the opposition leader and former defence minister, revealed he “believed it possible to negotiate with the Americans to acquire, say, the first two submarines off the production line out of Connecticut”. “This wouldn’t mean waiting until 2038 for the first submarine to be built here in Australia,” he wrote. “We would have our first two subs this decade. I had formed a judgment the Americans would have facilitated exactly that.” The revelation prompted criticism from experts including Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said this had not been agreed by the US government and it would be a “pretty serious kind of breach or leak [to disclose it]” if it had. “No boats are available before 2030 unless the US gives up its own – that would be quite remarkable – the US has been clear there is no way they can build additional submarines,” Hellyer told Guardian Australia at the time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T17:14:10Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: counteroffensive will be long and very bloody, says US general – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","fields":{"bodyText":"That’s all for our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today.

A 51-year-old man has been killed by shelling in Mala Tokmachka, a village near the frontline in the southeastern region of Zaporizhia, local officials said. President Zelenskiy has said that a “serious threat” remains at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that Russia is “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Two children have also been injured in Russian shelling of a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. Last week’s mutiny by the Wagner Group serves as a “vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin’s war on his own society and his own regime”, CIA Director William Burns has said. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez has addressed the Ukrainian parliament after his country assumed the presidency of the European Union. He said that Ukraine would win the war against Russia and, in time, be granted access to the bloc. Sánchez also announced that Spain had allocated €55m to support small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine. The number of Russian casualties since the start of the war now stands at more than 228,000, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence. The ministry also claimed Russia had lost 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles, and 3,519 drones. A 51-year-old man has been killed by shelling in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, according to the head of the local military administration. In a post on Telegram, Yuriy Malashko said the shelling had hit the village of Mala Tokmachka, which he described as a “frontline community under merciless enemy fire”. The village is about 25 miles east of the Dnipro River and immediately on the current border between Ukrainian- and Russian-controlled territory. Malashko added that two people – a 40-year-old woman and a 39-year-old man – had been injured in the shelling and were receiving treatment. He urged local to “take care and go to safe places!” Last week’s mutiny by the Wagner Group shows the “corrosive effect” the war in Ukraine is having on Russian society, the CIA director has said. Williams Burns was speaking at an event hosted by the Ditchley Foundation, which stages conferences focusing on British-American relations, in Oxfordshire. It comes after it was revealed he had made a secret trip to Ukraine to meet with President Zelenskiy and intelligence officials. “It is striking that [Wagner leader Yevgeny] Prigozhin preceded his actions with a scathing indictment of the Kremlin’s mendacious rationale for the invasion of Ukraine and of the Russian military leadership’s conduct of the war,” he said. Before launching the mutiny, Prigozhin released a series of audio messages in which he accused Russia’s military leaders of trying to “deceive the public, deceive the president and tell a story that there was some crazy aggression by Ukraine, that – together with the whole Nato bloc – Ukraine was planning to attack us”. Burns continued: “The impact of those words and those actions will play out for some time – a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin’s war on his own society and his own regime.” Vladimir Putin’s efforts to end a coup by the Wagner group may have made it easier for an international court to prosecute him, and the Russian state, for war crimes committed by the mercenary fighters, according to experts in international law. After the mutiny led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin said the mercenaries had been “fully funded” by Russian authorities. In the year to May 2023 alone, they received more than 86bn roubles from the state budget, or over $1bn, he added. “Those words potentially have very significant consequences in terms of exposing the Russian state to responsibility for the acts of Wagner, and Putin personally and individually as the leader of the Russian state,” said Philippe Sands KC, a professor of law at UCL and the author of East West Street, a book about the origin of international humanitarian law. Read the full story here: Two children have been injured in Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. Writing on Telegram, Oleksandr Prokudin said the shelling hit a residential area and that a nine-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were injured. He said both were receiving medical treatment. Kherson, which sits on the western bank of the Dnipro River near the frontlines of the conflict, has been the target of heavy shelling since Ukrainian forces freed it from Russian occupation during a counteroffensive late last year. In the previous post, you’ll find pictures of damage done to homes in the city during the shelling on Saturday. Here are some picture’s of the damage to homes in Kherson taken on Saturday after Russian shelling. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for more international attention to be paid towards the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. He warned on Saturday that a “serious threat” remained at the plant and said Russia was “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference in Kyiv with visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. He gave no further details. Ukrainian military intelligence has previously said Russian troops had mined the plant. He also urged sanctions on Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, for his “important visit and support of our people” on Twitter. Sánchez visited Kyiv on Saturday and addressed Ukraine’s parliament, telling lawmakers that their country would win the war against Russia and that their bid to join the EU, while deserved, would not be an “easy process”. On Twitter, Zelenskiy added: “It is extremely symbolic that this visit takes place on the very first day of the Spanish presidency of the EU. Our common European home cannot be imagined without Ukraine, without our courage and commitment to freedom and justice.” Media outlets from “unfriendly countries” are due to be banned from Belarus. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has signed a law allowing media from “unfriendly countries” – those that have imposed sanctions on Belarus – to be banned, Pul Pervovo, a state outlet that reports on Lukashenko’s activities, said on Saturday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said a serious threat remains at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant because Russia is technically ready to provoke a localised explosion at the facility, Reuters reports. Earlier, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate claimed Russia was reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of the Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. The CIA director, William Burns, made a secret trip to Ukraine where officials outlined a strategy to take back control of Russian-occupied territories and bring the war to an end, reports the Washington Post. Overnight the Post reported that Burns had recently travelled to Ukraine to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Ukrainian intelligence officials. During the trip, the officials revealed a Ukrainian strategy to recapture territories occupied by the Russians as well as their endgame to open peace talks with Moscow with a view to ending the war. The newspaper reports: “… in private, military planners in Kyiv have relayed to Burns and others bullish confidence in their aim to retake substantial territory by the fall; move artillery and missile systems near the boundary line of Russian-controlled Crimea; push further into eastern Ukraine; and then open negotiations with Moscow for the first time since peace talks broke down in March of last year.” The Post also reported that Kyiv would agree not to forcefully recapture Crimea from Russia in exchange for western security guarantees. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, addressed Ukraine’s parliament on Saturday, telling lawmakers that their country would win the war against Russia and that their bid to join the EU, while deserved, would not be an “easy process”. Recalling Spain’s own accession process, which began in 1977 after the country transitioned from dictatorship to democracy, Sánchez said the process requires “changes, reforms, and sacrifices”, but that the experience taught his country “important lessons”. “Reforms make your governance and economy better, more modern, and more transparent,” Sánchez said. “They bolster international confidence and proximity. They attract investment. And, in time, they will grant you access to our European Union.” Sánchez started Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council of the EU today and wasted no time underlining his support for Kyiv with the visit. During the trip he also announced a €55m aid package for Ukraine. Here is an overview of today’s stories so far: The top US military officer, army general Mark Milley, has warned that Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and that achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”. “No one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said in Washington. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He addressed the Ukrainian parliament. He is visiting Kyiv on the first day of Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims its forces have killed more than 228,000 Russian military personnel since the invasion began last year. The ministry also claims Russia has lost about 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles and 3,519 drones. Figures from Ukraine’s defence ministry suggest there were almost 20,000 deaths among Russian military forces in June alone. The CIA director, William Burns, travelled to Ukraine recently and met with intelligence counterparts and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a trip that was not reported at the time, a US official has confirmed to Agence France-Presse. According to the Washington Post, which first reported the visit, Ukrainian officials shared plans to take back Russian-occupied territory and begin ceasefire negotiations by the end of the year. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview published on Friday. The CIA director, William Burns, called the Russian spy chief, Sergei Naryshkin, after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported. The call was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, the WSJ said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said he is certain Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed in his country will never be used. Lukashenko and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have acknowledged that some tactical weapons have arrived in Belarus and the remainder would be put in place by the end of the year. Lukashenko said on Friday: “As we move along, we become more and more convinced that they [the weapons] must be stationed here, in Belarus, in a reliable place.” A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate has claimed. It said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims its forces have killed over 228,000 Russian military personnel since the invasion began last year. The ministry also claims Russia has lost about 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles and 3,519 drones. On 1 June, the ministry claimed Ukrainian forces had killed 208,370 Russian military personnel. These figures suggest there were almost 20,000 deaths among Russian military forces in June alone, according to figures released by Ukraine’s defence ministry. Here are some pictures of the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the Ukrainian parliament on Saturday. He is visiting Kyiv on the first day of Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council. He is expected to meet Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit. Russia has resumed commercial flights to Cuba for the first time since the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Rossiya Airlines, part of Russia’s Aeroflot group, resumed scheduled flights to Cuba on Saturday, which had been suspended since western countries shut Russia out of their airspace in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The first flight of what will start as a twice-weekly service took off for the Cuban resort of Varadero from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on Saturday, Aeroflot said. Russian airlines suspended flights to Cuba, Mexico and the Dominican Republic on 28 February last year, four days after the invasion, which Russia calls a “special military operation”. The deputy prime minister for tourism, sport, culture and communications, Dmitry Chernyshenko, announced in May that regular flights to Cuba skirting the airspace of “unfriendly” countries would resume by July. Here are pictures from Friday of family and co-workers attending the funeral of a young female killed in a missile attack that hit a restaurant in downtown Kramatorsk on 27 June. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer have written an analysis about the likely vengeful response opponents of Vladimir Putin should expect after the attempted Wagner mutiny last weekend. Four days after Vladimir Putin faced the most serious challenge to his 23-year leadership, the Russian president called in the country’s top media figures for a briefing in the Kremlin. The panic of last weekend, as the troops of renegade warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin seemed set to march into Moscow, was still fresh in people’s minds. Putin, who had disappeared from public view for nearly two days as the crisis came to a head, was now holding meetings with various key players, including the editors of loyal media outlets, to project an image of calm control. “The main message was that he is dealing with the situation,” said Konstantin Remchukov, editor-in-chief of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper with Kremlin connections, who was present at the meeting. “He is starting to investigate and will ask every question, find everything out, and draw the necessary conclusions.” Nonetheless, as the shock of last weekend’s drama starts to wear off and those in the political elite begin to digest the import of events, which Putin himself claimed almost spilled into “civil war”, there are many questions hanging in the air. Read the full story here The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Kyiv Independent reports. Today is Spain’s first day at the helm of the Council of the EU’s rotating presidency. Ukrainian forces are “almost certainly” being redeployed in the east bank of the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region, the UK’s defence ministry said. In their daily update on Thursday, the ministry said fighting had intensified in the east bank from 27 June and that Russia had “highly likely reallocated” elements of the Dnipro Group of Forces to “reinforce the Zaporizhzhia sector”. Combat around the bridge’s head is almost certainly complicated by “flooding, destruction and residual mud” from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam earlier this month, the ministry added. Reuters reports that Japan’s defence ministry said late on Friday it had spotted two Russian navy ships in the waters near Taiwan and Japan’s Okinawa islands in the previous four days, following a similar announcement this week from Taiwan. Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had spotted two Russian frigates off its eastern coast and had sent aircraft and ships to keep watch. Japan’s government said last month that repeated Russian military activity near Japanese territory, including joint drills with Chinese forces, posed “serious concern” for Japan’s national security. Japan and Taiwan have joined the United States and its allies in imposing wide-ranging sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine last year. The Japanese ministry said two Steregushchy-class frigates were first spotted 70 km (40 miles) south-west of Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni, in Okinawa prefecture neat Taiwan, on Tuesday morning. The vessels sailed back and forth through the waters between Yonaguni and Taiwan, moved eastward and were last spotted on Friday in the waters between Miyako and Okinawa islands, it said, adding Japan dispatched two vessels to monitor the Russian ships. Russia’s Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday that a detachment of ships of the Russian Pacific Fleet had entered the southern parts of the Philippine Sea to perform tasks as part of a long-range sea passage. The director of the CIA, William Burns, called the Russian spy chief Sergei Naryshkin after last weekend’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the US had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported. Burns’ phone call with Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, took place during the week and was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, Reuters reported the WSJ as saying. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, led the armed revolt last weekend, denouncing Russia’s military leadership and threatening to “destroy” his rivals, then abruptly called it off as his fighters approached Moscow. Joe Biden said on Monday that the uprising was part of a struggle within the Russian system and that the US and its allies were not involved in it. Separately, Burns made a secret trip to Ukraine recently and met his intelligence counterparts and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a US official has confirmed to Agence France-Presse. It reported the official as saying the mutiny “was not a topic of discussion”. More information has arrived on the casualties of a Russian missile attack on Friday on a village school near the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Reuters reports that Ukrainian police said two women had been killed and six people injured. A 56-year-old primary school teacher and a chief accountant, 44, died in the strike on the village of Serhiivka, the police said. Twelve employees were the building’s only occupants, the prosecutor’s office said. Ukrainian schools were not in session for students on Friday. Ukraine’s national police said in a statement: Russian troops, in a direct hit, destroyed a school where civilians were located. The Donetsk region prosecutor’s office said four men aged 54 to 69 and two women aged 24 and 34 were injured and taken to hospital, and that it had launched an investigation into the attack. The CIA director, William Burns, travelled to Ukraine recently and met intelligence counterparts and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a US official confirmed to Agence France-Presse on Friday. The trip was not reported at the time and comes amid Ukraine’s counteroffensive. During his trip Burns reaffirmed “the US commitment to sharing intelligence to help Ukraine defend against Russian aggression”, the news agency quoted the US official as saying. According to the Washington Post, which first reported the visit, Ukrainian officials shared plans to claw back Russian-occupied territory and begin ceasefire negotiations by the end of the year. Burns “travelled to Ukraine as he has done regularly since the beginning of Russia’s recent aggression more than a year ago”, the US official said. The Post reported that the visit occurred in June. The trip took place before the 24-hour rebellion led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to the official. The mutiny, widely seen as the biggest threat to Kremlin authority in decades, “was not a topic of discussion”, the official added. Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”, the top US military officer has warned Army general Mark Milley told the National Press Club in Washington that the counteroffensive was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields ... 500 meters a day, 1,000 meters a day, 2,000 meters a day, that kind of thing”. Reuters also reports that Ukraine has been cautious in publicly counting gains in the counteroffensive it launched last month to reclaim Russian-occupied territory. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged last week that it was going “slower than desired”. Milley said he was not surprised progress was slower than some people and computers might have predicted. War on paper and real war are different. In real war, real people die. Real people are on those front lines and real people are in those vehicles. Real bodies are being shredded by high explosives. Milley added: What I had said was this is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a quick look at the latest. The top US military officer, army general Mark Milley, has warned that Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and that achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”. “No one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said in Washington.

The circuit breakers have all tripped. I climb on a chair and flip them back one by one, trying to isolate the problem. “I’m gonna check my office,” I say. “If the electricity goes off, alert me.” I slip boots over my bare feet and run through the rain to my office shed. Looking back toward the kitchen, I see my wife and the middle one staring at me through the windows. I reach over and flip on a light switch. Nothing happens, but the kitchen darkens. My wife and the middle one raise their arms above their heads and wave them like signalmen. “I guess I’m working inside today,” I say, once power is restored downstairs. “Do I need to call Kitch?” my wife says, meaning the electrician. I turn on the coffee machine. All the lights go off. “Yes,” I say. I run a long extension lead from the sitting room so I can make coffee. Upstairs, I can hear my wife talking to Kitch. “You’ve got to come today,” she says. “I can’t have him working in the house.” I’ll get no work done if Kitch comes, I think, because he will require me for an apprentice. I put a slice of bread in the toaster. All the lights go off. Kitch turns up at about 2pm, tool bag in hand. “Have you isolated the source, like I taught you?” he says. “Kitchen sockets,” I say. “Which includes my office.” “That’s good,” he says. “Make me a coffee.” I show him where the wire for my office emerges from the house through a hole drilled through the brick. “Amateurs,” he says. “Full disclosure,” I say. “I rewired that garden light myself a couple of months ago.” “It won’t have anything to do with that,” he says. “Good,” I say. “The inside of it was so complicated I had to post a picture online and ask for help.” “You didn’t think to call your electrician?” he says. “I thought you’d be busy,” I say. “I’m always available,” he says, “to educate.” He tests the kitchen sockets one by one, treating me, as usual, as if I have an important electrician’s exam coming up. “Any others?” he says. “The ones for the washing machine? And the dryer?” He nods. “Good,” he says. “Show me.” The washer and tumble dryer are in a cupboard just off the kitchen, stacked on shelves one above the other. “Why are they raised up?” he says. “I don’t know. It was always like that,” I say, “but the tortoise lives under there in the winter, so …” Kitch reaches beneath the washing machine and pulls out a cobwebbed box full of brushes. “Been looking for your shoeshine kit?” he says. “Yes,” I say. “For six years.” He shines his torch on the pipe behind, which is shrouded in a delicate nimbus of black mould. “That’s overflowed,” he says. “The socket is damp.” “So my troubles are compounded,” I say. “Beyond all measure.” “Don’t panic, Tim,” he says. Kitch changes the socket for a new one, and tells me to put a bowl under the pipe to catch any leaks until he can bring someone round to look at it. “How much do I owe you?” I say. “Let’s see how things progress before we get into that,” he says. If he won’t let me pay him, I think, it means my apprenticeship has only just begun. Next morning I go out early, but as soon as I get home in the evening I go to check the pipe behind the washing machine. Then I immediately go and find my wife. “Has Kitch been here?” I say. “No,” she says. “Then who left the washing machine face down on the floor?” I lead her back to the cupboard. “Huh,” she says. “It must have shaken itself off its platform.” “Why would it do that?” I say. “Because I put a big duvet in it,” she says. I look at the machine, lying there in a puddle like a depressed robot, and I think: beyond all measure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/07/un-report-on-japans-fukushima-water-plans-fails-to-placate-opponents","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-07T12:44:22Z","webTitle":"UN report on Japan’s Fukushima water plans fails to placate opponents","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/07/un-report-on-japans-fukushima-water-plans-fails-to-placate-opponents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/07/un-report-on-japans-fukushima-water-plans-fails-to-placate-opponents","fields":{"bodyText":"The publication this week of the UN nuclear watchdog’s positive assessment of Japanese plans to pump more than 1m tonnes of water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean has failed to placate opponents. China is fiercely opposed to the plans, despite a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) backing the scheme, while the support of the government of South Korea has failed to quell widespread public opposition to the idea in the country. The government in Seoul said on Friday that it “respected the IAEA’s review of plans by Japan and the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), to pump water from the plant into the Pacific over the next 30 to 40 years”. The discharge would have “negligible consequences” for South Korea, it said in an attempt to win over a deeply sceptical public. The country’s ban on food and seafood products from the Fukushima region will remain in place, however. But South Korea, whose conservative president, Yoon Suk Yeol, is attempting to mend diplomatic fences with Japan over the countries’ wartime legacy, is a lone voice of support in the region. On the same day, China announced a ban on food imports from 10 of Japan’s prefectures over “safety concerns”, and said it would conduct stringent radiation tests on food from the rest of the country. “The Japanese side still has many problems in the legitimacy of sea discharge, the reliability of purification equipment and the perfection of monitoring programmes,” Chinese customs said. The IAEA review brought Japan closer to the start of the long operation to pump the water – a mixture of groundwater, rain that seeps into the area, and water used for cooling damaged nuclear fuel – into the ocean, with reports suggesting it will begin in August. About 1.3m tonnes of water stored in huge tanks on the site has been filtered through Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system (Alps) to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The treated water will be diluted with seawater so that the concentration of tritium is well below internationally approved levels before being released into the ocean 1km from the shoreline via an undersea tunnel. The water is contaminated after being used to cool fuel rods that melted after the plant was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, triggering a triple meltdown at the Fukushima plant. Japan’s top government spokesperson, Hirokazu Matsuno, responded to criticism of the plan by saying that Fukushima Daiichi would pump far less tritium into the ocean than Chinese and South Korean nuclear facilities. Japan’s standard for the release of tritium, at below 22tn becquerels a year, is far stricter than that of its neighbours, Matsuno said. According to Japan’s trade and industry ministry, the Yangjiang nuclear plant in China discharged about 112tn becquerels of tritium in 2021, while the Kori power station in South Korea released about 49tn becquerels. That is unlikely to placate opponents in Fukushima, where fishing communities have warned the water discharge will undo more than a decade of work to repair the damage the meltdown inflicted on the reputation of the region’s seafood, which is subject to one of the world’s strictest radiation testing regimes. “We here in Fukushima have done absolutely nothing wrong, so why do they have to mess up our ocean?” said Haruo Ono, a fisher in Shinchimachi, 34 miles north of Fukushima Daiichi. “The ocean doesn’t belong to only us humans – and it isn’t a rubbish tip. “It’s been 12 years [since the meltdown] and fish prices are rising, so we were finally hoping to really get down to business. Now they’re talking about releasing the water and we’re going to have to go back to square one again. It’s unbearable.” Fisheries cooperatives in three prefectures were due to submit a petition with 33,000 signatures on Friday expressing their opposition to the water discharge. While their government has given Japan breathing room, many South Koreans remain sceptical of Tokyo’s safety assurances. Some are panic-buying salt amid contamination fears, while a Gallup poll conducted in June found 78% of South Koreans were either “very worried” or “somewhat worried” about potential harm to the marine environment. “It’s much more difficult to make sales now, as customers are asking more questions as they worry a lot,” said Jin Wol-sun, a stallholder at Seoul’s Noryangjin market, where market officials carried out random radiation tests on seafood in an attempt to reassure shoppers. Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, conceded there had been a lack of unanimity among the IAEA scientists, who come from 11 countries, including China, involved in the safety review. One or two “may have expressed concerns” over the plan, he said in an interview with Reuters. “I heard that being said … but again, what we have published is scientifically impeccable.” China’s state-run Global Times newspaper on Thursday said Liu Senlin, a Chinese expert in the IAEA’s technical working group, was disappointed with the “hasty” report and had said the input from experts was limited and only used for reference. Other experts openly voiced concerns about the impact the discharge could have on marine and human life, and accused Tepco and the IAEA of cutting corners. “We have repeatedly pointed out to Tepco and IAEA substantive concerns we have with Japan’s approach and flaws in their methodology,” said Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress, an adjunct professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in the US. Dalnoki-Veress, a member of a panel of scientists that advised the Pacific Islands Forum, cited Tepco’s controlled tritium-exposure experiments on fish, which he said included only three species that were being fed on commercial fish pellets rather than exposed smaller fish, which would normally be their food source. “We have repeatedly offered to help advise on how to conduct these experiments, but each time Tepco rejected them,” he said. “We take as proof that they are not truly interested in collecting relevant data that may demonstrate and confirm concerns regarding their present plans.” The “dumping” of treated water into the ocean, he said, would cause potentially irreversible damage to the local fishing industry. “When we think about the effect of radiation we can’t just think about the effect on the environment, we have to consider the effect on cultures, societies and peoples who suffer psychological effects, a sense of fear, and reputational damage. Trust has been broken, and it will be difficult to repair.” Shaun Burnie, a senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace who regularly visits Fukushima, said claims that tritium posed no risk to human health were “scientifically bankrupt”. “The concern is not over external exposure,” Burnie said. “It is internal exposure to organically bound tritium that is the problem – when it gets inside fish, seafood, and then humans. When tritium gets inside cells, it can do damage. “Tepco and the Japanese government are making a conscious decision to increase marine pollution with radioactivity, and they have no idea where that will lead.” • This article was amended on 7 July 2023.

For me, and most people on this planet, this is about as close as we are likely to get to a superyacht. In Australia, that’s a pleasurecraft longer than 24 metres. Internationally, the starting length is 30 metres. The City of Melbourne recently spent $1.97m upgrading Victoria Harbour, including its four superyacht berths, to fit vessels up to 67 metres long. But for the tiny portion of the world’s ultra wealthy for whom superyacht size is a matter of concern, 67 metres is fairly moderate. The longest privately owned superyacht in the world is the 180-metre Azzam, reportedly built for the former president of the United Arab Emirates, the late Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Superyachts are markers of power and extravagance. They are floating, transportable six-star hotels, capable of including everything from nail parlours to gyms, helipads and boardrooms, marble bathrooms and priceless art, as well as what the industry calls “toys” – from jet skis worth the equivalent of the average Australian worker’s salary to private submarines worth millions. In a recent memoir, the longtime Australian seafarer and superyacht captain Brendan O’Shannassy writes: “Until space travel becomes a commercial reality, [superyachts] are the greatest display of wealth on the planet.” For all their capacity to allow long-distance travel in extreme luxury, though, superyachts aren’t frequent visitors to Australian waters. The local industry has been lobbying to change that, and state and federal governments have made superyacht-friendly moves, hitching millions of dollars in public infrastructure upgrades and tax concessions to claims that these will bring millions in economic benefits to every port in which a vessel makes anchor. But despite public money going towards establishing and upgrading infrastructure that is only accessible to the very privileged few, there’s been little public scrutiny of this elite industry. *** Superyachts are not super common, although their numbers are growing. Sales company Edmiston recently estimated that the global fleet comprised a total of 5,892 vessels – representing an increase of 44% over the last decade. Most of those yachts are between 30 and 50 metres (4,957); 13% are between 50 and 80 metres (753) and 3% are over 80 metres (182). There are only about 120 superyachts owned by Australians, concentrated mostly around Sydney Harbour and south-east Queensland. About half of them are charter vessels. It’s likely all of them have, at some point, been through Captain Richard Morris’s hands. Fresh off the plane from the Dubai Boat Show, Morris tells Guardian Australia that he got his start in the merchant navy at 17, before landing a job as a deckhand two years later on the 86-metre superyacht Nabila, owned by the influential and extravagant Saudi arms dealer, fixer and liaison of presidents and tycoons Adnan Khashoggi. Nabila was Khashoggi’s third yacht and the height of ostentatious luxury when it launched in 1980. Its 100 rooms included Italian hand-carved onyx bathrooms, a patisserie, a movie theatre, a hair salon, a hospital with an operating theatre, and 320 metres of Italian leather upholstery. When Khashoggi’s empire began to decay in the late 80s, he sold Nabila to Donald Trump for $29m – considered a bargain – with the businessman who would later become US president renaming the yacht the Trump Princess. Morris, meanwhile, left Nabila after a year and began building his own career as a seafarer, becoming a captain at just 27 and a master mariner. He moved ashore in 1999 and was hired by NSW Maritime to build a new superyacht marina in Rozelle Bay. “That was the beginning of superyachting in Australia,” Morris says. “Prior to that, only a few people here had superyachts, because there was the tall poppy syndrome – high net wealth Australians were reluctant to show their extreme wealth.” The Sydney Olympics in 2000 changed that, Morris says. The marina development was partly to accommodate the super wealthy who were planning to bring their yachts down for the Games. Morris managed the marina for the next decade, before moving into local superyacht sales and charters. The Sydney experience is one that the industry is keen to replicate for the forthcoming Brisbane Olympics. The mining magnate Gina Rinehart may have been lampooned by the public in 2021 when she complained that she had nowhere to moor her yacht in Brisbane, but the Queensland Labor government appears to agree it should invest in more superyacht infrastructure. It’s had a multiyear superyacht strategy since 2018, and in May last year it was updated and extended to take the Olympics into account. Its listed achievements so far include $28m to upgrade the Cairns Marine Precinct, $2.87m for a 160-metre superyacht berth on the Gold Coast, and planning for 80-metre superyacht facilities and additional marinas in new developments on the Spit. Its stated goal is for Queensland to be “world recognised as the major superyacht hub in the Asia-Pacific region”. Economic modelling for industry lobby group Superyacht Australia argues the 2032 Games presents “an unparalleled opportunity to springboard the sector on to the global stage and demonstrate the prosperity the sector can support in Australia”. It hopes Australia will reach 8% of the global market – that’s 533 vessels – in the next three years, which it says will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in direct economic benefits. Until just prior to the pandemic, superyachts could not come to Australia without the owner paying a hefty tax on the vessel, with the visiting multimillion-dollar vessels treated as though they were being imported permanently into the country. That changed with the passage of the Special Recreational Vessels Act 2019. The act, which relieves the owner of having to pay import duties including GST, was hitched as a rider to various unrelated bills by the Coalition government until it was passed as a standalone just before Christmas in 2019. The legislation allows foreign vessels to be chartered while in Australian waters, with GST payable only on the charter itself. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The then member for the Queensland seat of Dawson, George Christensen, claimed it as a pet project. “I have been very, very pushy in getting this legislation to come forward,” Christensen said at the time. Christensen claimed the bill was “just about ensuring that local communities can get some of the coin that these people drop”. Labor passed the bill with minor amendments. Since then, six superyachts have applied for a temporary licence, with just four making the trip. ‘It’s your world’ The industry estimates that the local market for superyacht charter or purchase is 1% of the population. It sees it as a subset of the cruise market, which is estimated to capture about 5% of Australians. It’s hard to ignore the symbolism of that figure, the 1%. Morris’s anecdotes help to illustrate just how that plays out in practice. In 2011, the manager of U2 called him, he recalls, hoping to find a suitable superyacht for the band who were dissatisfied with the crowds at the Park Hyatt. (He was unable to find one that met the band’s specific desires.) That same year, Morris put up the actor Kevin Spacey in the 37-metre Tango during Spacey’s run as Richard III in Sam Mendes’s production that toured Sydney’s Lyric theatre. “Dinner was at 1am and [Spacey’s] guests would leave at 4am. Then the yacht would move to Rose Bay and he’d sleep till midday, and then come back and do it all again,” Morris says. “It’s an option for these very high-profile people. They’re anchored in the middle of the harbour. The level of security and discretion that a superyacht provides is much better than any hotel. They can control their world. And that’s the essence of yachting – it’s your world.” When Covid lockdowns hit, owners of superyachts raced to their vessels, escaping up to the Great Barrier Reef instead of staying at home, Morris says. The associated freedom saw a boom in superyacht sales in 2021. Since the onset of the war in Ukraine, however, superyachts have also become associated with sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Not without reason: they represented 30% of the global market. Documents recently revealed, for example, that the former Chelsea FC boss Roman Abramovich owned 16 superyachts, a full eight of which were support vessels for the 162.5-metre A$649.5m Eclipse he’d had built in 2010. Morris says there were Russians who had planned to come to Australia prior to the war – one of whom was going to contract him to manage his yacht. It would have put millions through his business. The sanctions, though, have “put the fear of God through the industry”, he says. “If I was managing a Russian yacht I would have gotten rid of it. It’s so lucrative, though, that a lot of people didn’t. I’m glad that the Russian client didn’t come. Sure, I missed out on huge revenue, but that’s not the point.” *** The 2032 Olympics aren’t the local industry’s only goal. Another is to bring more vessels to Australia to make use of the shipyards – mainly in Queensland and Western Australia – for maintenance, retrofitting and building. Another still is to increase the number of Australians joining the superyacht workforce. On Facebook groups like Superyacht Crew, keen industry up-and-comers post pictures of themselves – snorkelling, in uniform, sipping a glass of wine in a party dress – alongside their formal qualifications and experience. The semi-casual CV comes with added notes about the seafarer’s personality, including whether or not they have tattoos (being tattoo-free appears to be a selling point). Employment standards, however, can vary. Commercially registered yachts available for charter, which usually have permanent captain and crew despite the rotating guest list, are bound by the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, which lays out minimum standards of employment, including legally enforceable contracts, maximum working hours per week, shore leave and annual leave entitlements, and the right to return to your country of residence for free. Enforcement of those standards is the responsibility of the country under whose flag the ship sails, and yachts chartering out of Australia need to be registered here. Private yachts are a different story. They are not automatically covered by the Maritime Labour Convention, and employment contracts are often managed by owners’ personal office staff. Non-disclosure agreements are common, and rumours abound that upsetting the wrong people on board can see you unceremoniously dumped at the nearest port. Superyacht crew in Australia are not covered by any union-based collective bargaining agreements. The Maritime Union of Australia national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, tells Guardian Australia that the MUA doesn’t have a real presence among the superyacht labour force, but alleges exploitation and harassment are rife. Morris vehemently rejects this, saying the working conditions on superyachts are “exceptional”, better than cruising or commercial shipping, higher paid, and far exceeding the minimums set by the Maritime Labour Convention. Guardian Australia was unable to speak to any junior superyacht crew directly, despite attempts, but a survey of 402 superyacht crew members conducted by the International Seafarers’ Welfare and Assistance Network in 2018 described them as mainly well paid. More than 90% of survey respondents – male and female – said they felt safe on board, though 53% of female crew said they had experienced discrimination, harassment or bullying from owners, other crew or guests, compared with 30% of men, who most commonly experienced it from captains or other senior crew. The level of work-related stress was high, particularly among women. No matter who ultimately owns them, private yachts are likely to be flying what the industry calls a “flag of convenience”, which can make standards harder to enforce, as the boat can spend very little, if any, time in its country of registration. Flags of convenience are a common maritime business practice, though, including in cruising and freight. And the results can be ironic: a cursory registry search of some high-profile private superyachts reveals, for example, that the mining magnate Andrew Forrest’s 58.2-metre Pangaea Ocean Explorer – which will shortly carry out environmental surveys on the DNA of ocean life, assisted by $3m in federal funding to Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation – sails under the Jamaican flag. Clive Palmer’s 56-metre $40m yacht, despite being patriotically named Australia, is registered in Malta. Control, chameleons and seasick fish What is it that draws the ultra rich to yachting? “Control,” says David Good, the chief executive of industry peak body Superyachts Australia. “You can control the itinerary, who is on board and what food is going to be served. During the pandemic, when you were on board was probably the only time you could fully take control of who was going to be with you and your family. Covid was probably one of the best things that ever happened to boating in general.” Sam Sorgiovanni concurs. He’s used to catering to the whims of wealth: a sought-after designer based in Western Australia with about 35 years of experience, Sorgiovanni estimates he’s designed at least 20 superyachts. The biggest challenges usually relate to balancing functionality with the budget constraints of the commissioner. But some design requests are more complicated. For the Nirvana, Sorgiovanni says his company designed two onboard terrariums for chameleons, water dragons, turtles and frogs, and a separate cricket facility to breed the reptiles’ food. The terrarium included curtains to shield the animals from the disco lights of an adjacent salon. On Anastasia and Barbara – owned by the same Russian billionaire as Nirvana – the designers were asked to include fish tanks. Unfortunately, they later discovered, fish kept in a tank on a boat die – from seasickness. The origin of most of the super wealth that fuels superyacht ownership is natural resources, Sorgiovanni says. But criticism of the industry, he says, echoing Morris, is “tall poppy syndrome”. “Yachting is the greatest redistribution of wealth around. Although it is for the privileged few, if you take a 100-metre yacht, there’s 50 crew on board, they’re all being paid, they’ve all got families, and wherever that yacht goes, especially if we’re allowing them to come into charter, as soon as it pulls into port … it would be millions generated every time the vessel comes in,” he says. “It’s a pyramid. We’ve got the yachts at the top, and a pyramid of suppliers underneath it.” *** Saltwater and air is hard on boats, and superyachts require a lot of money for upkeep, and a lot of maintenance. So when an owner abandons ship, the vessels suddenly become very large and very unwieldy public burdens. In February, the government of Antigua and Barbuda claimed and put up for auction the 82-metre Alfa Nero, which it said had been abandoned in Falmouth Harbour since early last year. The owner is rumoured to be the Russian oligarch Andrey Guryev; Guryev has denied owning the yacht, according to other reports. That same month, the 29-metre superyacht Nakoa broke free of its moorings in Honolua Bay in north-west Maui, Hawaii, and drifted before running hard aground in shallow water, peppered by rocks and reef. The US Coast Guard seized jurisdiction of the yacht after its owner, the charter mogul Jim Jones, informed authorities that he would not organise or pay for the boat’s salvage. Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a series of statements that Jones would instead receive a bill of at least US$460,000 for the salvage effort, and may face further penalties and possible legal action. Facing widespread criticism, Jones told Honolulu media that he was “taking responsibility” for the matter. “We’ve been talking to the DLNR to let them know we’re not leaving them with the bill,” Jones said. “We’re not running.” Timely and safe salvage was important to the local community but also to the environment. The grounding occurred just outside a significant marine conservation zone, and the yacht struck and damaged at least 30 corals and live rocks, its hull leaking diesel into the reef. Footage of the wreck circulated on social media, where commenters raged about the fuel seeping into the pristine water and the damage to the reef. It took contractors three salvage attempts over nearly two weeks to dislodge the 122-tonne Nakoa. On 5 March, three tugboats managed to drag it back into the water. As they set off to tow the yacht to Honolulu, a pod of humpback whales surfaced and escorted the boats out of the bay, away from the marine sanctuary. The Nakoa never made it back to dock. Halfway to Honolulu, the yacht began listing heavily. Unable to be dragged any further, it was scuttled in the deep channel between the islands of Maui and Molokai, and left to sink to the ocean floor. The whales swam on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/27/labor-should-use-its-power-for-the-people-and-lift-jobseeker-rates-former-rba-governor-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-26T15:00:05Z","webTitle":"Labor should use its ‘power for the people’ and lift jobseeker, former RBA governor says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/27/labor-should-use-its-power-for-the-people-and-lift-jobseeker-rates-former-rba-governor-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/27/labor-should-use-its-power-for-the-people-and-lift-jobseeker-rates-former-rba-governor-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government “needs to start using its power for the people like it promised it would,” a former RBA governor has said, as he joined calls for a lift to the jobseeker rate. Bernie Fraser, who was tasked with guiding Australia’s monetary policy through 18% interest rates and “the recession we had to have”, said the unemployment payment was one of the “many areas desperately needing attention” in the coming budget. His voice joins the chorus of people – including Labor backbenchers – to publicly demand the government do more to raise the jobseeker rate, which has condemned recipients to poverty. The government is also facing an internal battle, with MPs demanding the cabinet react to the increasingly loud calls. Fraser said it was the duty of the government to act in the best interests of its people and during this time of record low unemployment, it had a chance to change some people’s lives for the better. “I am supportive of an increase in the jobseeker allowance – it is not only necessary but timely,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “By providing extra support, it might help enable people to get a good-paying job to change their circumstances.” The government’s own expert panel recommended an urgent increase to jobseeker and associated welfare payments, arguing the rate as it was had become a barrier to finding work. Labor MP Peter Khalil on Wednesday night became the latest Labor MP to publicly pressure his own government to raise the rate. He tweeted that he had joined a growing list of colleagues in signing an open letter from the Australian Council of Social Services calling for a jobseeker increase. “My comments supporting raising jobseeker are on the record. I’ve advocated on this issue publicly &amp; internally with colleagues since elected in 2016,” Khalil wrote. “It’s the fair &amp; right thing to do so people can live in dignity.” The former Treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry agreed, writing in an opinion piece for Guardian Australia that it was time to raise the rate. “People who are unable to secure employment within a short period of time, in a labour market this tight, clearly need special help,” he wrote. “Equally clearly, they are not getting what they need. Denying them such help, while insisting that they should have to survive on $50 a day for more than 12 months, is simply cruel.” Fraser said it was a “difficult job to fit in all the worthy things” needed in the budget and there were some difficult decisions for the government to make. But he said there was also a clear choice. “They have got a bit of power. They should be using it for the people.” The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has not committed to raising the rate, although he has said there will be cost of living relief in the budget with a focus on helping the most vulnerable. Chalmers said the focus was helping people into work, given Australia’s tight labour market. But advocates argue that ignores the realities for the long-term unemployed, who are more likely to be older, low-skilled, experiencing chronic health difficulties or have a disability. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the budget was yet to be finalised and the expenditure review committee had one more meeting before signing off on the economic plan, which will be handed down on 9 May. But both Chalmers and Albanese, as well as the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, are facing increasing pressure from the caucus to act, with many backbenchers nervous about the electorate’s reaction to a Labor government not living up to expectations. “The Greens are really nipping at our heels on this and housing and if we don’t come up with the solutions people expect from us, then we may not get a second chance,” one MP said. “I don’t think there would be many Labor MPs who are not worried about the impact for people trying to live on welfare. There’s a public campaign, but there is also a lot happening privately to try and push this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T07:30:14Z","webTitle":"Awe by Dacher Keltner review – the transformative power of wonder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jan/05/awe-by-dacher-keltner-review-the-transformative-power-of-wonder","fields":{"bodyText":"I find it hard to think of a word that is as unmoored from its root as “awesome”. It comes from the early Middle English age, meaning dread, or terror, but these fail to capture awe’s particular blend of fear, reverence and submission. It is often found in religious contexts (Milton wrote of “aw” in Paradise Regained), but crops up in politics too (Hobbes viewed awe as a valuable tool for an all-powerful state, or “Leviathan”). Since the time of those writers there have been ongoing attempts to claim the emotion; the most reviewed book about awe on Amazon is by a Philadelphia-based pastor, who laments: “All too often, we stand in awe of everything but God.” The author of those words should probably stay clear of Dacher Keltner’s new book. Like a dogged species collector, Keltner pursues awe wherever it may be found: in historical and literary sources, scientific papers, the lives of his interviewees and his own experiences. Yet the book is far more than a field guide. Keltner, a bestselling author and psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is on a personal mission to reveal the secrets of the good life. “Twenty years into teaching happiness,” he writes, “I have an answer: FIND AWE.” Keltner studied under the psychologist Paul Ekman, a pioneer in the study of emotion who documented facial expressions in different cultures (Ekman argues that certain expressions of emotion are universal, a view that has been challenged by other psychologists). Like Ekman, Keltner is now in high demand as an emotion expert; he has collaborated with Pixar on its film Inside Out and now heads Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, which offers advice on everything from parenting to political polarisation. Early on in his book Keltner defines awe as “the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends your current understanding of the world”. There is a lot to unpack in this definition: our experience of awe is bound up with cultural notions of scale, our place in the cosmos, and context (whether we find a mountain awe-inspiring or simply terrifying may depend on the local risk of avalanche). Keltner tells us that the experience of awe varies among different cultures, but it is a universal emotion, one accompanied by its own language of chills, tears and “vocal bursts”, like “oohs” or “whoas”. He acknowledges that awe has a dark history, but insists that today it has largely been shorn of fear, citing one study that suggests it sits closer to emotions like joy and admiration. For Keltner, awe is an ennobling experience, one that can foster wonder, creativity and collaboration. He understood this in 2019 when he lost his brother, Rolf, to colon cancer, and he writes movingly about the transformative feelings that followed. “The boundaries that separated me from the outside world faded,” he writes. “I felt surrounded by something vast and warm. My mind was open, curious, aware, wondering.” In his quest to make sense of awe, and convince us of its virtues, Keltner embarks on a journey to find the emotion in a wide range of sources, from mystical texts to conversations with artists. In doing so he shows that the stimuli for awe are remarkably varied, dividing them into eight categories (or “wonders”), including “moral beauty” and “collective effervescence”. Awe often defies language, but Keltner is highly attuned to its traces. Detective-like, he observes his interviewees’ facial expressions and gestures. “When I play, I feel the vibration in my heart,” the cellist Yumi Kendall tells him. “It is beyond language. Beyond thought. Beyond religion. It is like a cashmere blanket of sound.” In one chapter, Keltner describes his visit to San Quentin state prison in San Francisco where he asks prisoners about their experiences of awe. It’s a crucial part of his book that seeks to anticipate an oft-made criticism of the self-help genre: that the author’s proposed remedy, if it works at all, can only be taken up by those familiar with cashmere blankets. Keltner finds that prisoners, facing unfathomably difficult circumstances, do indeed experience awe, whether when reading the Qur’an or singing in a church band. “Awe,” he writes, “is almost always nearby, and is a pathway to healing and growing in the face of the losses and traumas that are part of life.” If anything, he says, those who have wealth or status may find it harder to access. It is no easy task to reconcile scientific research with the messiness and ambiguity of the stories that we tell about ourselves and our emotions. The sciences and the humanities are sometimes compared to an estranged couple, and Keltner nobly seeks to address both parties, discussing the vagus nerve and Saint Francis of Assisi in the same breath. Yet the two can never quite converse in this book. Presented in rapid succession, Keltner’s stories and cultural references can seem mere instruments to buttress his taxonomic system; rarely does he stay with his characters and explore how awe has played out in their lives. As an author he wears many hats: there is Keltner the scientist, carefully explaining what we know about human emotion; Keltner the ethnographer, quizzing prisoners and artists about awe; Keltner the spiritual guide, exhorting us to embrace an emotion which leads to an ennobling sense of smallness; and Keltner the status-conscious public intellectual, dropping into Pixar’s offices or having dinner with the Spielbergs. It makes for an interesting, if disorientating, reading experience, and one that speaks to our own age, where the secular now holds ground previously occupied by religion. His case is often convincing, and yet as a lay reader this text left me with more questions than answers. Is awe always the pathway to happiness? Anyone who dips into the troubled history of the 20th century will learn that fascism was adept at harnessing the power of awe, whether through monumental architecture or mass rallies. Keltner briefly writes about a veteran of the Iraq war, but he doesn’t pause to unpack the meaning of the US military strategy which, in part, took the name of his subject: “shock and awe”. “Awe” here is not ennobling, but an instrument of domination, as those on its receiving end well understood (some Arab writers translated “awe” in this phrase as tarwī˛ : terror). All this suggests, at the very least, that the meaning of this elusive emotion may not be as far from its fearful origins in Middle English as we suppose. That if one can write a book extolling awe, citing Gaudí, Romanticism and Nelson Mandela, there is another one to be written which draws on the work of fascist architect Marcello Piacentini, the Rajneeshpuram cult and the nuclear bomb. That to call an emotion good or bad depends a great deal on our assumptions about human nature and history. • Awe: The Transformative Power of Everyday Wonder by Dacher Keltner is published by Penguin (£16.99).

At briefings held in the capital city in the days after the Aukus announcement in March, Australian officials reiterated that the submarines would not be armed with nuclear weapons. They said the acquisition was “a sensible response to changing strategic circumstances, and would serve as a deterrent and contribution to regional equilibrium”.

The documents show 62 embassies or high commissions sent representatives to briefings held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) where they were able to ask questions about the plan. “Disinformation was also a key focus of our advocacy, with speakers encouraging those in attendance to engage with counterparts here and with Australian representatives in capitals to ensure the accuracy of information they were receiving,” said an internal note circulated within Dfat. The document did not specify examples of such disinformation, but the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has previously said some of China’s public statements about Aukus are “not grounded in fact”. China’s mission to the UN said in March that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard” – the US and the UK – “are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. The new documents show that many of the answers given by Australian officials at the Aukus briefings aimed to reassure countries about nuclear non-proliferation issues. The first assistant secretary of Dfat’s Aukus taskforce, Sarah deZoeten, told those in attendance that Australia would retain control of operational waste and spent fuel. “Spent fuel would not have a chemical composition that could be turned into nuclear weapons without additional chemical processing, which would require facilities that Australia did not have and would not seek,” she said, according to the official notes. Australia’s ambassador for arms control and counter-proliferation, Ian Biggs, said the government was working with the International Atomic Energy Agency. “Any attempt to build those facilities would be very obvious to the IAEA.” Aukus is novel because it will be the first time a provision of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty regime has been used to transfer naval nuclear propulsion technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the documents show Biggs rejected concerns there could be a “breakout” of a nuclear weapons capability. “Regarding proliferation concerns, Biggs noted that Australia’s acquisition of NPS [nuclear-powered submarines] would be difficult and expensive; it would not constitute a ‘breakout’ because this was not a process that would be easy to replicate,” the documents say. “Australia was committed to setting the highest possible non-proliferation and safety standards, which other states bearing legitimate ambitions to acquire NPS would similarly have to meet,” Biggs was recorded as saying. Biggs argued these standards “would apply to all states in the region, such that if replicated by others, their acquisition of NPS would not present a non-proliferation concern to us”. Guardian Australia has previously revealed that a Chinese embassy official asked Australian officials at one of the briefings whether the Aukus submarines were intended for “sightseeing”. The documents released by Dfat did not include the wording of the questions asked by foreign diplomats at the events, on the grounds that disclosing those details could harm international relations. But the answers addressed similar themes. In one case, deZoeten replied that “these would be military assets, not civilian – but unlike the NPS being used by others in the region, Australia’s NPS would not carry nuclear weapons”. Australia plans to buy between three and five Virginia class submarines from the US in the 2030s, before the Adelaide-built “SSN Aukus” – based on a British design – enters into service from the 2040s. At the briefings, Australian officials said US Congress would need to approve the Virginia class purchase, but the government was “heartened” by the level of bipartisan support. “Australia would continue to engage with the US on the matter of new versus re-used Virginia class submarines, but in all scenarios these boats would have the highest standards of quality and safety,” deZoeten said. Australia is expected to buy a mix of new and used Virginia class submarines. Officials said the submarines would be “under Australia’s complete sovereign control”, an issue that has been a topic of considerable pushback from former prime ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull. US and UK nationals may join Australian crew on board the new submarines but such a presence would not be a “prerequisite” for operating them, the officials said. Biggs said Australia’s crews “would have no reason to access the reactor cores” but there would still need to be “maintenance of the reactors throughout the NPS lifecycle … so crew members needed nuclear qualifications to understand what they would be looking after”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/17/electrical-union-wants-australias-net-zero-targets-boosted-by-substantial-investment-and-state-ownership","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-16T15:00:51Z","webTitle":"Electrical union wants Australia’s net zero targets boosted by ‘substantial’ investment and state ownership","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/17/electrical-union-wants-australias-net-zero-targets-boosted-by-substantial-investment-and-state-ownership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/17/electrical-union-wants-australias-net-zero-targets-boosted-by-substantial-investment-and-state-ownership","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s shift to net zero emissions should be accelerated by “substantial public investment” in renewable electricity including expanded state ownership, influential leftwing unions will argue at Labor’s national conference. The Electrical Trades Union (ETU) will use the party conference to call on the Albanese government to seize the “most significant economic opportunity since the Industrial Revolution” to drive down power prices for households and create secure, well-paid jobs for thousands of Australians. The amendment to Labor’s platform will be moved on Thursday morning by the ETU national secretary, Michael Wright, and seconded by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union’s (AMWU) Steve Murphy. It cites the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the European Union’s Green New Deal as evidence of “significant investments” that should spur Australia to greater investment in “cheap, clean, and abundant renewable energy resources”. Original drafting of the amendment suggested investment should be in the order of $152bn for manufacturing, renewables and electrification with a five fold increase in the National Reconstruction fund from $15bn to $76bn, however details of the size of increase were stripped from later versions. The unions point to Labor’s legislated target of 43% emissions reduction by 2030, based on renewables making up 82% of the electricity sector, as proof the government is already committed to ambitious action. But the conference motion comes as the Coalition argues that untested and costly alternatives including small-modular nuclear reactors could be a more feasible path to baseload power. The ETU amendment is set to be debated on Thursday during the economic chapter of Labor’s platform, which will also feature the construction union’s motion for a super profits tax to fund increased spending on housing, and the United Workers Union’s call to review stage-three tax cuts. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A push from the Labor Environment Action Network to end native forest logging will be debated in the environmental chapter on Thursday afternoon. Senior Albanese government ministers are working behind the scenes to avoid motions hostile to Australia’s Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition, including from the Maritime Union of Australia and an AMWU Victoria motion to rethink the plan. It will be debated on Friday morning. A separate, potentially embarrassing motion would remove a positive reference to Aukus from the draft national platform, which states “our self-reliant defence policy will be enhanced by strong bilateral and multilateral defence relationships, including Aukus”. The Maritime Union of Australia national president, Christy Cain, told Guardian Australia the Aukus plan to spend $368bn on nuclear-powered submarines while saying more can’t be spent on housing is “the tail wagging the dog – it’s ridiculous”. Cain will also seek to remove a legislated Labor policy in the industrial relations debate on Friday afternoon. In November 2022, Labor passed legislation that means workers can only take protected industrial action after the compulsory Fair Work Commission conference. “It’s disgusting, it’s not Labor values,” Cain said. “Even the Liberals wouldn’t try that. A Labor government is making it harder for workers to win cost-of-living pay increases.” The ETU motion commits Labor to invest in the “rollout of renewable energy generation, transmission and electrification through a national reindustrialisation strategy” to respond to “unprecedented global supply chain shocks, Covid-19 and the pressing challenges of climate change”. It calls for the policy to be enacted through “tax credits or equivalent mechanisms to incentivise local manufacturing investment”, procurement policies that require minimum levels of local manufacturing and “expanded public ownership” of critical assets. “Labor acknowledges the need for significant regulatory reform to unlock the transmission capacity needed to support a grid built on renewables,” it says. Under the plan, infrastructure projects valued over $100m will be designated “strategic projects” requiring use of local content, while all government-funded projects will also require pay deals with unions as a pre-condition of tender. Ahead of the national conference, the industry minister, Ed Husic, said the government wanted to use the NRF to demonstrate Australia can manufacture renewables and low-emissions technologies “here onshore and deploy them quickly”. “The world has twigged that … it might be cheaper to manufacture something many thousands of kilometers away, but then you’ve got to ship it and the emissions benefit instantly evaporates [when] you think about the emissions impact of that transport,” Husic told Guardian Australia on Monday. Asked if the $15bn NRF will be big enough given the Inflation Reduction Act’s USD $369bn investment in energy security, the NRF’s chair, Martijn Wilder, said the investment comes in addition to other initiatives including the clean energy finance corporation, industry policy and “the venture capital ecosystem we have in Australia”. Husic said: “The challenge of the IRA is that you don’t lose your capacity, that is that firms don’t get lured offshore to do work in the US. “We want to signal this [decarbonisation] is really important to Australia. We’re lining up the support to make it happen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
