One of Australia’s most significant events of 2023 has finally arrived, and to everyone in Brisbane for the NRL’s Magic Round – play hard but fair. There’s also the not insignificant matter of us officially gaining a new head of state. I know, I know – these things creep up on you when your day-to-day is completely unaffected by it. For the royal watchers among you, the Guardian has the event (and its fallout) covered. If you’re a bit “meh” about it all, read on – you’re not alone. 1. God save us all Take it away, Stephen Marche – Canadian author and cultural commentator: *** “You might think you live in a time of truth and reconciliation, or perhaps even, if you’re feeling optimistic, progress. But this week if you’re British or a member of the 56 sovereign states that still, somehow, find themselves in the Commonwealth, you’re waking up in a country where a priest is going to smear oil – vegan oil from Jerusalem – on a rather pinkish, rather broad forehead to signify one man’s status as the Lord’s anointed.” Marche journeyed from Toronto to London to try to make sense of the crowning of King Charles. “The man represents us,” he writes, “but it’s hard to think of anyone less representative.” How long will it take to read: 10 minutes. Further reading: Guardian Australia encounters a mix of apathy, indignation and enthusiasm on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney. And in England, Gaby Hinsliff was contentedly indifferent until the call to swear an oath of allegiance went out. 2. Oliver Stone on Putin, US politics and nuclear power Oliver Stone’s filmography is all about going big: the Vietnam war, media-fuelled mass murderers, any number of US presidents (and who really killed them). Now the legendary firebrand is not only tackling the vexed issue of nuclear power but making a strong case for it in his new documentary, Nuclear Now. Lauren Mechling caught up with Stone (and his real-time factchecker, and his “twinkly-eyed” therapist) in New York and emerged relatively unscathed. What does he think of the Russian president? “A great leader for his country and the people love him.” And Joe Biden? “A cold warrior in the worst sense of the word.” How long will it take to read: Four minutes. 3. Was Michael Jordan’s career a failure? That was the question posed by Giannis Antetokounmpo when a reporter prodded him about the early exit of his Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. After all, Jordan won only six titles in 15 seasons – a 40% success rate. Below average, if you look just at the numbers. Barry Glendenning writes that the NBA great in waiting’s “unique, bold take” was a breath of fresh profundity among the usual post-match platitudes. *** “Some days it is your turn, some days it’s not. That’s what sports is about. You don’t always win.” – The world according to Giannis How long will it take to read: Three minutes. Further reading: As the LA Lakers and Golden State Warriors again do battle in the NBA playoffs, one of LeBron James or Steph Curry will add to their legacy. 4. The dreary, seductive allure of ‘stealth wealth’ “Stealth wealth” is the name given to the clothes worn by the super-rich, writes Eva Wiseman. Defining characteristics? “Bloodless, grandly bland, dreary.” So why do so many of we mere mortals get sucked into trying to dress like the 1%? Notable quote: “Buying into ‘stealth wealth’ feels like buying a band T-shirt, except the band are the worst people in the world, and the T-shirt costs the same as a month’s rent, and the music is them laughing as they shout ‘Eat shit’ from a car.” How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. How two reporters gave voice to the victimised Christopher Knaus reported the first clear evidence of how income averaging was being used by Centrelink to raise millions in inaccurate debts. That was early 2017, when he says covering the scheme later known as robodebt was like “bashing your head against a wall”. Until Luke Henriques-Gomes arrived at Guardian Australia the following year. His reporting, which foregrounded the voices of welfare recipients, and Knaus’s was singled out during the royal commission at which Scott Morrison took the stand. Caitlin Cassidy interviewed Knaus and Henriques-Gomes for the first in a series marking the 10th anniversary of Guardian Australia. How long will it take to read: Three minutes. Further reading: Marina Hyde sounds off on a UK scandal with uncanny similarities to robodebt – and how as the chatterati get consumed by the daily outrage cycle, “iniquitous and dysfunctional systems [are] free to sail on regardless”.

The outage meant mission control lost command, telemetry and voice communications with the station in orbit. The power outage hit as upgrade work was under way in the building at Houston’s Johnson Space Center. The crew was notified of the problem through Russian communication systems, within 20 minutes of the outage. Space station program manager Joel Montalbano said neither the astronauts nor station were ever in any danger and that backup control systems took over to restore normal communications within 90 minutes. “It wasn’t an issue on board. That was purely a ground problem,” he said. “At no time was the crew or the vehicle in any danger.” “We knew this work was going on, and in preparation for that we have the backup command and control system that we would use if we have to close the centre for weather emergency, especially important during the hurricane season,” he said. It is the first time Nasa has had to fire up these backup systems to take control, according to Montalbano. He said Nasa hoped to resolve the issue and be back to normal operations by the end of the day. Nasa maintains a backup control centre miles from Houston in the event of a disaster requiring evacuations. But in Tuesday’s case, the flight controllers stayed at mission control since the lights and air-conditioning still worked. “We’ll better understand what happened and then take lessons learned and move forward,” Montalbano said. The tensions between the US and Russia on Earth do not prevent their respective space agencies from working together, although Moscow has said it will withdraw from the ISS after 2024 and build its own station instead. In February, Moscow launched a rescue vessel to the ISS to bring home three crew stranded after their original capsule was hit by a meteoroid. Last year, cosmonauts arrived at the ISS wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, colours that match the Ukrainian flag, shortly after Russia’s invasion began. The message, if any was intended, was unclear. Months later, Russia’s space agency published photos appearing to show cosmonauts on the ISS holding the flags of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.

These icons needed their fashion moment,” says British fashion designer Christian Cowan. The icons in question? They’re up to 10ft tall, frolic on a bucolic planet, hang out with a vacuum cleaner and worship a neonate deity known as the Sun Baby. Cowan is used to dressing the likes of Cardi B, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga and Lizzo rather than Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po. The London College of Fashion graduate set up his eponymous label in 2016 and has built a cult following thanks to party girl looks and outrageous collaborations, including collections with Powerpuff Girls, Doritos and TV sitcom American Dad. It is fitting, then, that he was the brains behind March’s most charming fashion collaboration: a new Teletubbies capsule collection. A photoshoot was set up to promote Cowan’s new line: in it, the Tubbies pose in their original suits alongside human models in bright-coloured clothing. These photos have been printed on the shirts, hoodies and jeans available to buy – autographs of the four stars are splashed across the prints. The standout piece, though, is the Teletubbies Boot, a green high heel number zipping up to a bust of Dipsy and priced at £2,041. While Cowan’s Instagram post playfully reads “no caption necessary”, commenters – including Marc Jacobs, Paris Hilton and Michelle Visage – were more outspoken. “Need!” exclaimed Hilton. Time will tell whether they sell or remain as a social media memory; at the time of writing, the tees and jeans have sold out but there are still boots available. While Cowan’s capsule may seem offbeat, he is not the first to be inspired by the aerial-headed quartet. The boots follow in the footsteps of a collaboration with Koi footwear last December, featuring five vegan, gender-neutral shoes with colour schemes to match all four characters, plus faithful vacuum cleaner Noo-Noo. Dipsy, too, has walked the runway for London designer Bobby Abley as part of his Tubbies-inspired collection in 2017. Teletubbies has always been in fashion. Created by former teacher and children’s television show producer Anne Wood and writer Andrew Davenport, the show premiered on BBC Two in March 1997 and quickly became a kids’ classic, reaching 2 million viewers an episode in just five months. Teletubbies Say Eh-oh, the show’s theme tune, was a UK No 1 single for two weeks later that year. The show would go on to be exported to pretty much every country under the infant sun, becoming one of the BBC’s most lucrative programmes ever and spawning a dizzying array of toys and spin-offs. The tabloid interest was so fervent that visitors were blindfolded to keep the show’s filming location secret. Later, after it was discovered to be filmed in a field in Wimpstone, Warwickshire, the owner filled the site with water to stop a constant stream of fans from trespassing. Like the best kids’ shows, Teletubbies made absolutely no sense. So much so that it led to outrage from parents, aghast at its lack of comprehensible speech or educational value. Harvard psychologist Susan Linn saw it as another sign of the increasing commericalisation of children’s television, while the Daily Mirror said “the show was a bad influence on children”. In the end, though, the alien babies won, playing their part in 485 episodes on-and-off until 2018. Now, Tubbymania is back. In November last year, Netflix relaunched the show. That followed on from the animated series Teletubbies, Let’s Go! just two months prior, and a 3D version looking at baby Tubbies, Tiddlytubbies. Last year, the official quartet even auditioned on Britain’s Got Talent to celebrate 25 years in the biz. Dancing to Beyoncé and One Direction, they handed out antennae headbands while confetti blasted in the background. The audience went bananas, and two minutes were frittered away in the best way possible. The comeback is thanks to the creative minds at WildBrain, an animation studio and digital media company that also owns the licences to Inspector Gadget and In the Night Garden. It is set on pushing the Tubbies back to the front and centre of pop culture. “They’ve never really gone away,” says Melissa Goodrich, who oversees franchises at the company. Noting that the “original fans are now adults”, Goodrich believes that the foursome are ready to re-enter the zeitgeist through “over-the-top fun moments in pop culture, fashion and important causes”. One of those causes has been supporting gay pride, with the Tubbies teaming up with the labels Ellesse and GoGuy for a Pride collection. Back in 1999, commentators such as the firebrand US baptist pastor Jerry Falwell were outraged about Tinky Winky’s red handbag, arguing that it suggested that he was gay and a danger to children. Tinky Winky has since been celebrated as a gay icon. “I remember the outrage about Tinky Winky’s handbag as a child and the hysteria over a purple alien wearing a skirt,” says the Brighton-based drag artist Alfie Ordinary, who performs a routine inspired by the purple Tubbie. “I wanted to take this homophobic outrage and make Tinky Winky truly outrageous,” he says. WildBrain is actively encouraging collaborations, licensing out the likeness to designers, artists and performers to get more Tubbies on the telly. It’s no wonder that so many are clamouring to do so: the visuals, for aesthetes into kitsch, are the best thing since sliced tubby toast. If you think the Tubbies look out-of-this-world, you’re right: they’re based on astronauts. “I was fascinated by the moon landings,” Davenport told the Guardian in 2012. “It struck me as funny that, at this pinnacle of human achievement, the figures that emerged in bulky spacesuits from landing capsules are like toddlers, with oversized heads and foreshortened legs – and they respond to the excitement of their new world by bouncing about.” It was an inspired decision: with their pipe-cleaner antennae, gormlessly cheery faces and tummy-mounted TVs, the show’s alien babies are instantly recognisable. You know you’ve got a hit on your hands when your characters already look like toys; sales of merchandise in the show’s first decade are estimated to have exceeded $1bn. Of course, as with any kids’ TV show, the visuals aren’t all sunshine and rainbows. As anyone brave enough to rewatch a beloved childhood programme will know, there can be a creepy, uncanny side to the shows of our youth, and even the biggest Teletubbies fans will admit this exists in Tubbyland, too. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey director Rhys Frake-Waterfield, who’s currently making a name for himself by giving horrific, adult twists to childhood icons (Bambi is next) wishes he could do the same with the Tubbies. “I have always thought the Teletubbies were incredibly strange. They are like half-naked aliens who hang around with children,” he says. “There is something very evil going on, which I’d love to explore.” There’s no risk of a Teletubbies slasher crossing into the mainstream – unlike Winnie the Pooh, the show’s copyright will last into the next century. Its co-creator Wood, though, who is still producing new shows, has expressed concern about how reboots can stunt original creativity. “There are other people out there making good work, or at least they could, were they given the opportunity,” she said recently. While Wood’s concern is understandable, the comfort-blanket quality of shows such as Teletubbies continues to appeal. “Millions of my generation grew up with them daily as we ate our sliced apple,” Cowan says. “My sister and I would pile on to the sofa to tune in to our vivid friends. We always have a soft spot for our childhood idols.” With many more collaborations in the future ready to enchant children and adults alike, we won’t be saying tubby bye-bye any time soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/14/legal-experts-criticise-suggestions-indigenous-voice-will-have-veto-power-in-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T09:36:52Z","webTitle":"Legal experts criticise suggestions Indigenous voice will have veto power in parliament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/14/legal-experts-criticise-suggestions-indigenous-voice-will-have-veto-power-in-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/14/legal-experts-criticise-suggestions-indigenous-voice-will-have-veto-power-in-parliament","fields":{"bodyText":"Constitutional experts have criticised suggestions the Indigenous voice will have veto power in the Australian parliament, calling such prophecies “doomsdaying” and “distorting” of the truth. Speaking at the first hearing of the joint select committee on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice referendum, a string of legal experts said the voice would be legislated to provide representations on relevant matters, akin to advice. The former chief justice of Australia Robert French had four words of reply to the hand-wringing among conservative circles, including the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, that the voice could hold a de facto veto over public holidays. “No substance in it,” he said. “I’ll be polite about it. “That would be no more than advice and it certainly wouldn’t bind anybody and it wouldn’t be a veto. What is a de facto veto? … I’m still at a bit of a loss. “If I were confronted with this provision as a judge … it’s a big thing, to draw a constitutional implication and the implications which have been suggested are not supported by the text and will be inconsistent with it.” The former high court justice Kenneth Hayne told the inquiry that he couldn’t see “anything in those drafts that comes anywhere near providing anything like a veto”. “The voice will not waste its social or political capital by exploring the outer range of its scope of representation,” he said. “[That is] an unreal case or distorting possibility or extreme example.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The constitutional lawyer Anne Twomey agreed. She said she was confident the voice would stay focused on core issues affecting First Nations people and to do otherwise would squander its resources and influence. “If the voice goes out and tries to make representations about what submarines Australia should buy or whatever, well … people will think it’s crazy,” she said. “But more to the point its constituency of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be awfully furious that it is not focusing on the things that are relevant and important to them.” Experts were split, however, on whether the wording of the constitutional amendment should be altered to remove the reference to the voice as being able to make representations to the executive government. Louise Clegg, a barrister from PG Hely Chambers, was in favour. She said there was “no prescription” in the Uluru statement about what should be in the wording and to exclude it would still satisfy the statement, while clarifying she wasn’t an Indigenous person. The constitutional lawyer Prof Greg Craven said there had been “mission creep” by the working group in drafting the wording and it was “very surprisingly different” to what he thought when it came back out. But the constitutional barrister Bret Walker said it was “bizarre” to suggest the inclusion of a reference to “executive government” would bring in court cases. He said the proposed wording “vaults over race” to recognise people were “supplanted against their will” and who “have not been dealt with very generously ever since”. “It’s the combination of recognition and a kind of reparation, which in my opinion cannot possibly, seriously or charitably be seen as an exercise of inequality,” he said. Twomey told the inquiry the high court was “not in the business of trying to destroy government” and reiterated executive government means minister and government departments but does not include all statutory bodies. George Williams, a constitutional lawyer, said the voice would go some way towards finishing the “unfinished business” of the 1967 referendum that recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. He said the constitution is a document that does not reflect the people “who have been the custodians of these lands and waters” for tens of thousands of years. Inquiry hearings will be held in Orange, Cairns and Perth to gather views from Indigenous communities and those involved in the processes that led to the voice proposal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T12:27:27Z","webTitle":"Farm Hall review – riveting wartime thriller shows secret mission to bug German nuclear scientists","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/mar/15/farm-hall-review-riveting-wartime-thriller-shows-secret-mission-to-bug-german-nuclear-scientists","fields":{"bodyText":"In the summer of 1945, after Adolf Hitler was defeated and the allies had almost secured victory in the second world war, six German scientists were taken and held at a stately home in Cambridgeshire. The group, known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club) were leading lights in Germany’s nuclear weapons programme and part of the race to produce the world’s first atomic bomb. They were detained at Farm Hall for seven months, all their conversations covertly recorded. We see those men in Katherine Moar’s riveting drama with nothing to do but play chess, bicker and pick over their part in Hitler’s war. It unravels like an intelligent thriller whose ending we know but is nail-biting nonetheless – all the more an achievement given this is Moar’s debut. A drama inspired by the original recorded conversations and directed by Stephen Unwin with elegant economy, it is packed with learning but never shows off, providing just enough knowledge for a scene to carry its full meaning. Heisenberg (Alan Cox) is Uranium Club head and group leader here; his friend, Weizsäker (Daniel Boyd), has family links to the Third Reich, Bagge (Archie Backhouse) is an apologetic Nazi party member while Von Laue (David Yelland) was a vocal objector to the regime and Hahn (Forbes Masson) grapples with guilt for discovering nuclear fission (a key factor in the creation of the atomic bomb). Last, there is group pariah, Diebner (Julius D’Silva), who guiltlessly admits to supporting the Nazis. Every actor brings their character’s moral position alive and gives quietly searing performances. These positions are artfully played out in dialogue: some refuse to acknowledge responsibility, others boast of open resistance to Hitler but everyone is implicated in some way. “I needed the work,” says one man, about his collaboration. “The world is ugly, the work is beautiful,” says another, and there are echoes of CP Taylor’s Good in the ways they absolve themselves from blame. We only ever see them in a drawing room whose fireplace and peeling wallpaper carries a battered country-house grandeur (design by Ceci Calf). There is awkward comedy at the start, and in their boredom they resemble Beckett’s men; their keeper, referred to repeatedly but remaining off stage, a Godot-like figure who never emerges. That tone shifts in intensity when they hear of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings which bring – shockingly – intellectual admiration and jealousy, along with guilt for some. Hahn’s sense of culpability over the scientific discovery that led to the bombing is excellently dramatised. Heisenberg’s ambivalence is explored too – did he sabotage his own scientific breakthrough as a way to resist Hitler’s regime? The question lingers at the end of this punchy, accomplished play. At Jermyn Street theatre until 8 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/22/putin-biden-us-nuclear-new-start-treaty-russia-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T10:00:20Z","webTitle":"Putin aiming to divide US public opinion with nuclear treaty suspension, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/putin-biden-us-nuclear-new-start-treaty-russia-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/putin-biden-us-nuclear-new-start-treaty-russia-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin’s threat to suspend Russian participation in New Start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US, represents a blatant attempt to divide American opinion over the war on Ukraine by raising the specter of nuclear armageddon, experts and policymakers warned on Tuesday. Putin announced his intention to halt participation in the agreement towards the end of a belligerent 100-minute speech in which he charged the US and western powers with trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Russia. His fiery rhetoric prompted instant reaction across the political spectrum in Washington. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who was a Russian specialist at the White House National Security Council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”. The strategy was to increase political discord in an attempt to embolden calls for an end to US support for Ukraine. “It’s playing to all those people who want Ukraine to surrender and capitulate to avoid a massive nuclear exchange and world war three, a kind of nuclear armageddon,” she said. Thomas Graham, Russia director within George W Bush’s National Security Council, agreed that part of Putin’s calculation was to provoke “certain circles in the US to wonder whether the risks of supporting Ukraine are worth it”. Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that given how politicized Washington has become, “there will be elements in the Republican party who will play this up as a way of casting aspersions on Biden’s foreign policy”. Graham’s prediction appeared to have been fulfilled hours after Putin made his threat. Prominent rightwing Republicans heavily criticized Joe Biden’s surprise visit to Kyiv, accusing him of devoting more care to Ukraine than to his own people. Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida who is eyeing a 2024 presidential run, told Fox News that “an open-ended blank cheque [for Ukraine] is unacceptable”. He compared Biden’s staunch support for Ukraine unfavorably with his approach to immigration at the Mexican border. “I and many Americans are thinking to ourselves, OK, he’s very concerned about those borders halfway around the world, [but] he’s not done anything to secure our own border here at home.” New Start was negotiated under the Obama presidency in 2010 and renewed for five years in February 2021. It was designed to ensure strategic stability between the US and Russia, which hold 90% of the world’s total number of nuclear warheads. The practical implications of Putin’s threatened suspension are likely to be debated in Washington over the coming weeks. It is unlikely in the short term to change much on the ground, Graham pointed out, given that the treaty had already begun to unravel before the Russian president’s speech. Last month the state department accused Russia of breaking its monitoring obligations by refusing to allow US inspectors into its nuclear weapons facilities. Graham warned though that it will now be all but impossible to replace New Start once the treaty expires in February 2026. “We are looking at the final demise of the arms control architecture that was built up starting in the 1960s based largely on bilateral relations between the US and the Soviet Union and then Russia. We will have a much more difficult and complex environment to deal with.” Russia experts expressed relief that the Kremlin had stopped short of withdrawing from the treaty altogether. “This does not signify that Putin is planning to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine anytime soon,” said Suzanne Loftus, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. But Loftus added that the longer-term prospects of nuclear stability were “ominous”. She said: “We’re losing the progress we’ve made on non-proliferation, even during the cold war.” Putin’s audacious move puts the ball back in Washington’s court. Advocacy groups pressing for nuclear threat reduction urged the Biden administration to show restraint even in the face of the latest provocation. “The goal here, as we see it, is to get Russia back into New Start, because the treaty serves the national interests of both countries,” said Emma Belcher, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a Washington and San Francisco-based funding organization devoted to reducing nuclear risk. Belcher praised the way that Biden had so far refused to rise to Putin’s bait. In his speech to mark the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine in Warsaw on Tuesday, the US president pointedly declined to refer to his Russian counterpart’s threat to suspend participation. Such restraint should continue to be the Biden administration’s response, Belcher said. “What the US should avoid is to use Putin’s statement to justify increasing its own nuclear arsenal – that would merely move the clock back.” Christopher Chivvis, a senior fellow with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, gave a more sombre assessment of the impact on US policy. Putin’s move would make it more difficult for the US to monitor Russia’s nuclear forces and how they were deployed, he said, and a growing lack of clarity about Russia’s nuclear actions would in turn darken the mood in Washington. Chivvis said: “It will very likely drive Washington toward a more conservative, more hawkish, approach to the US’s own nuclear arsenal – just to err on the safe side.” The result, Chivvis suggested, could be exactly the arms-race dynamics the New Start treaty was intended to prevent. The US and Russia would, he said, likely now increase spending on their nuclear arms, which is not what anyone – Russia included – would logically want. Such a gloomy prognosis makes Hill’s warning that Putin was attempting to provoke rifts within American opinion all the more disconcerting. “Unity is extraordinarily important at this moment on the domestic front, because it determines our own ability to respond,” Hill said. “Putin is looking for any cracks. We need to be united as Americans, and resist the temptation to play silly politics over this.” • The headline of this article was amended on 14 March 2023.An earlier version referred to “nuclear treaty pullout”.

During the second world war, then Australian prime minister John Curtin found himself in direct conflict with the British government when Winston Churchill demanded Australian troops be deployed to Burma. But Curtin insisted troops return to defend Australia after the fall of Singapore in 1942. Asked on Wednesday what would happen in a situation like the one Curtin faced with Churchill, whether Australia would be in full control of the submarines or whether our independence could be muddied by operational oversight by the US or UK, the prime minister said: “Australia will maintain our sovereignty.” Albanese said the deployment of military assets in the event of any conflict was “a decision for Australia as a sovereign nation, just as the United States will maintain its sovereignty and the United Kingdom will maintain its”. The prime minister used a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to foreshadow increased defence spending as a consequence of the looming government response to the Defence Strategic Review, while characterising the Aukus security arrangement between Australia, the US and the UK as “the future”. There is persistent speculation the next steps in the Aukus pact will be outlined by the three alliance partners in the US in March. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Paul Keating has previously raised concerns about the potential for Aukus to erode Australian sovereignty. Keating has contended Aukus will see Australia’s strategic sovereignty “outsourced to another state, a North Atlantic state, the United States” which is dangerous, given the US had “no idea what to do with itself in Asia”. Keating’s concerns about sovereignty are shared by another former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether nuclear submarines could be “operated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navy”, and whether that effectively meant “sovereignty would be shared with the US”. Concerns about a diminution of Australian sovereignty were heightened back in 2021 when Biden’s top Indo-Pacific adviser, Kurt Campbell, observed that Aukus would lead to “a deeper interconnection and almost a melding in many respects of our services and working together on common purpose that we couldn’t have dreamed about five or 10 years ago”. Campbell later clarified his remarks. “I fully understand how important sovereignty and independence is for Australia. So I don’t want to leave any sense that somehow that would be lost,” he said during an Australian webinar ahead of the 2022 election. The sustained controversy has prompted the defence minister, Richard Marles, to declare in a speech to parliament that acquiring nuclear-powered submarines would “dramatically enhance” Australia’s sovereignty, rather than undermine it. The head of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce says Australia will retain full operational control over the submarines, while potentially having US or British engineers on board to provide technical advice. During Wednesday’s speech at the National Press Club, Albanese hinted that Australia needed to expand its nuclear research as part of Aukus, saying the arrangement would lead to “greater exchanges as well and greater knowledge buildup”. Albanese said that in order to “back up the assurance of sovereignty” Australia needed to build up its “human capability” – not just “capability in terms of things that are metal and shiny”. “That’s very much a part of our focus and our thinking,” he added. The prime minister also strongly backed the Asio chief, Mike Burgess, who has stepped up his warnings about espionage and foreign interference. Burgess used his annual threat assessment speech the previous night to say he was “concerned that there are senior people in this country who appear to believe that espionage and foreign interference is no big deal”. Burgess said some unnamed “individuals in business, academia and the bureaucracy have told me Asio should ease up its operational responses to avoid upsetting foreign regimes”. At no stage did Burgess suggest ministers were among those urging Asio to rein in its work. But Albanese said on Wednesday he wanted to make clear “that Asio is doing the right thing and that they have the support of my government in all of their actions”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T02:42:48Z","webTitle":"US nuclear-armed submarines to resume visits to South Korea for first time in 30 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/26/joe-biden-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"The US and South Korea have reaffirmed their alliance, agreeing that nuclear-armed submarines would resume port visits and threatening a “swift, overwhelming and decisive response” to any North Korean nuclear attack, including retaliation in kind by the US. The South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, said that response would include US nuclear weapons, making explicit an element of the alliance that normally remains unspoken. The warning to Kim Jong-un’s regime came as Yoon and Joe Biden issued a joint declaration marking the 70th anniversary of the alliance, during a visit by the South Korean leader to Washington on Wednesday. “A North Korean nuclear attack against the US or its partners is unacceptable, and would result in the end of whatever regime took the action,” Biden said. “I have absolute authority, and sole authority, to launch a nuclear weapon, but what the declaration means is that we will consult with our allies, if any action is so called for.” The visit and the declaration have come at a time of increasing nervousness in South Korea about North Korea’s nuclear buildup, and calls for Seoul to develop its own nuclear arsenal. The Biden administration is seeking to reassure the South Koreans of the US’s security commitment, amid signs that the North has made significant advances in its weapons programme, despite years of international sanctions targeting the regime in Pyongyang. Concern over the threat posed by its neighbour has sparked a serious conversation in South Korea over whether the country should develop its own nuclear deterrent. Once considered a peripheral view, the idea of possessing nuclear weapons is now supported by most South Koreans, according to recent opinion polls. The South gave up its nuclear weapons programme almost 50 years ago when it signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and officials in Washington are eager for that stance to continue, fearing that the peninsula could become the centre of a potentially dangerous arms race between North and South. But North Korea’s rapidly advancing weapons programmes - including ballistic missiles that can theoretically reach the US mainland – have added to concern in South Korea over whether the US would really use nuclear weapons to defend its ally under what it calls “extended deterrence”. Yoon, a conservative who has ditched his liberal predecessor’s policy of engaging with the North, earlier this year said his country was weighing developing its own nuclear weapons or asking the US to redeploy them on the peninsula. While Wednesday’s agreement will see the US and South Korea coordinate more deeply on a nuclear response strategy in the event of an attack by the North on its neighbour, nuclear weapons would remain under US operational control, while Biden made it clear that he was not contemplating the deployment of nuclear weapons in the South. “We are not going to be stationing nuclear weapons on the peninsula,” he said. In the declaration, Biden said Washington’s security commitment to Seoul was “ironclad” and that any North Korean nuclear attack on South Korea would be “met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response”. US extended deterrence, it said, was “backed by the full range of US capabilities, including nuclear”. The declaration also said the allies would consult more extensively “to defend against potential attacks and nuclear use and conduct simulations to inform joint planning efforts”. To underline the presence of the nuclear umbrella, US ballistic submarines armed with nuclear missiles will make port visits in South Korea for the first time since 1991. “Sustainable peace on the Korean peninsula does not happen automatically,” Yoon said. “Our two countries have agreed to immediate bilateral presidential consultations in the event of a North Korean nuclear attack and promised to respond swiftly, overwhelmingly and decisively using the full force of the alliance, including the United States’ nuclear weapons. “Deployment of strategic assets will be made constantly and routinely.” Derek Johnson, managing partner of the Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group, said the potential use of nuclear weapons by the US would only add to tensions in the region. “Nuclear weapons are a source of global insecurity and lie at the heart of the crisis on the Korean peninsula,” Johnson said. “Adding more of these weapons to the equation, even temporarily, will not make the United States or South Korea safer or more secure. This is far more likely to aggravate, rather than alleviate, pressures in the region, which could boil over catastrophically at any moment.” While Yoon is expected to use the declaration to try to persuade voters that Washington is taking South Korea’s concerns seriously, Jenny Town of the monitoring group 38 North said the declaration fell short of what some in the South had hoped for. It was “unlikely to either persuade North Korea off its current course of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] development and testing or to quiet the debate inside South Korea about its own nuclear future”, she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T08:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ale Hop & Laura Robles: Agua Dulce review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/mar/31/ale-hop-laura-robles-agua-dulce-review-channelling-the-cajons-raw-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The cajón contains a radical history. The box-shaped percussion instrument is now commonly used in acoustic setups but it originated in 19th-century Peru as a makeshift means of enslaved people defying Spanish colonial restrictions on music. Workers would put down their wooden crates and begin using them as drums, beating out rhythms and producing dances that have since become part of folk tradition. For Peruvian artist Ale Hop and percussionist Laura Robles, the cajón’s subversive past has been obscured by its contemporary ubiquity. On their debut album, Agua Dulce, they present nine tracks of electronically processed and deconstructed cajón rhythms, aiming to reconnect a percussive sound with its rebellious roots. Opener Son de los Diablos sets the tone. Taking its name from a traditional Afro-Peruvian dance, Robles’s electric cajón thunders through fuzzing reverb and gives the original’s skittering rhythm a menacing, industrial charge, supplemented by Hop’s synth bass. The dark atmosphere continues on the slow crawl of another folk dance, Lamento, while the galloping pace of Fuga en Alcatraz pits Robles’s dextrous cajón-playing against an eerie synth tone that rings out for the entirety of the track’s seven minutes. Each composition treads the line between establishing a stable, danceable groove and its collapse – making for an often unnerving listening experience. The title track fades the cajón rhythm in and out over squeaking electronics like an undulating wave, while Defensoras del Morro builds faster from techno to breakbeat before abruptly ending. These unpredictable contexts and electrified elements push the cajón into exciting new territory – far from the acoustic folk jam settings it is often found in today. In making its bass tone boom and allowing its higher registers to hiss with reverb, the duo create a modern reimagining of the instrument’s raw power, its heart-thumping tension and physical sense of catharsis. Also out this month Danny Mekonnen, saxophonist and ex-member of Ethiopian music group Debo Band, releases his first solo album as Dragonchild (FPE Records). On his beguiling self-titled record, Mekonnen traverses everything from Ethio-jazz to groove-laden funk and Afrobeats, all unified by the clarion call of his horn. MC Yallah returns with her fantastic second album, Yallah Beibe (Hakuna Kulala), pairing machine gun flows with bass-forward, deconstructed club edits. She plays fast and loose with genre, with highlights the screamo-influenced No One Seems to Bother and the dancehall euphoria of Big Bung. Producer Alex Figueira’s debut album Mentallogenic (Music With Soul) might prove to be a crate digger’s delight, trading heavily on dancefloor cumbia rhythms but with a raw, lo-fi recorded feel perfect for sound system atmospherics."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T11:10:48Z","webTitle":"‘There’s a lot of posturing’: Europe’s nuclear divide grows as one plant opens and three close","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","fields":{"bodyText":"When Europe’s first new nuclear reactor in 16 years came online in Finland, it was hailed by its operator as a “significant addition to clean domestic production” that would “play an important role in the green transition”. The opening last Sunday of the long-delayed Olkiluoto 3 plant, Europe’s largest, means about 40% of Finland’s electricity demand will soon be met by nuclear power, which the government says will boost energy security and help it achieve its carbon neutrality targets. Across the Baltic Sea and just hours before the Finnish plant came on stream, Germany was finally pulling the plug on its last three nuclear power plants, shutting down the steaming towers of Isar II, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II reactors late on Saturday. The environmental group Greenpeace, at the heart of Germany’s long-lived and powerful anti-nuclear movement, organised a party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. “Finally, nuclear energy belongs to history,” it proclaimed. There are few clearer illustrations of Europe’s nuclear divide. One faction, led by Germany, argues that the costs are too high and the risks – from reactor accidents and toxic waste – are, as the Green environment minister, Steffi Lemke, put it, “ultimately unmanageable”. Another, headed by France, argues equally forcefully that nuclear power is a reliable, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for electricity, and that phasing it out as Europe tries to meet vital green targets is ecologically damaging and economically senseless. The debate is not new. But with a third of the bloc’s nuclear reactors nearing the end of their original lifespan by 2025, and a legally binding aim of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, it is becoming increasingly intense. The energy shock that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, which brought an end to cheap gas imports and led Germany to briefly delay closing its last nuclear plants, has only entrenched the divisions. “There’s a lot of posturing,” the centrist MEP Pascal Canfin, who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “Different member states have made very different choices and have very different positions – and interests. “There’s scope for convergence and compromise. But given the sheer quantity of additional electricity we will need, both sides have to recognise we need every available solution … We have to take the politics and ideology out of this.” According to Eurostat, 25.4% of the EU’s electricity was nuclear generated in 2021, with 100-odd reactors in 13 member states. France, which has 56 operable nuclear reactors, accounting for just over half of that total. The divide across the bloc, though, is stark. If France has the highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (almost 70%), followed by Slovakia (52.4%) and Belgium (50.6%), others hardly touch it. The Netherlands stands at barely 3%. Germany’s opposition to nuclear goes back a long way; it was the main issue behind the launch of the country’s Green movement. Major accidents at Three Mile Island, Chornobyl and Fukushima reinforced an essentially ideological conviction. Advocates of its “Energiewende” green transition plan note that the 46% share of its electricity generated by renewables is far greater than the share that was produced by nuclear when its phase-out was first announced in 1998. While its plan, aimed at winning long-term public and industry support, will increase fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in the short term (coal is due to be phased out by 2038 or earlier), Germany argues it will also stimulate renewables growth. Immediate energy supply concerns meant public opinion swung against the shutdown last weekend, but polls before the war in Ukraine showed broad support for the principle. Other countries hold similar views. Several have already phased out nuclear, or plan to do so. Italy shut all its plants in 1990, after a 1987 referendum (in a 2011 plebiscite, held weeks after the Fukushima disaster, 94% of voters rejected a government plan to reintroduce nuclear power). Belgium was planning to close the last of its seven reactors by 2025, but recently extended the life of the two newest for a further decade, saying they were “critical to our energy security”. Spain aims to phase out its five active plants by 2035. Other opponents include Portugal, Denmark and Austria – which, along with Luxembourg, is suing the European Commission for classing nuclear energy as a “bridge technology” on the path to net zero, and thus as a “green” investment. In the French-led pro-nuclear camp, meanwhile, are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – which this year launched an alliance to boost nuclear cooperation within the bloc. Far from phasing out nuclear, Romania has doubled production in the last 15 years; Hungary and the Czech Republic have increased theirs by a fifth. Sweden is drafting a law to allow it to build more, while France aims to extend its plants’ life to 50 years and open at least six new ones by 2035. “Certain countries have made the extreme choice of turning their back on nuclear energy,” President Emmanuel Macron said when unveiling his plans in February. “Not France.” The country launched its nuclear programme after the 1973 oil crisis; a poll last year showed nearly 80% of voters support it, up 20 points from 2016. The nuclear standoff – at its most tense between France and Germany – has the potential to disrupt a range of vital EU projects, from changes to the bloc’s electricity market to the Green Deal programme supporting industry’s transition to net zero. For example, Paris and its central European allies have raged against a lack of support from Berlin for their efforts to have nuclear-derived hydrogen classified as “green” in EU legislation (so that it counts towards renewable energy targets). For Canfin, compromise will have to come through a general acceptance that renewable energy is “green” while nuclear energy is “low-carbon” – not fully green, because of its cost and risks, but also not “fossil”. “Text by text, we have to take the drama out of the question,” he said. “Behind the political slogans, there is starting to be convergence around the realities.” France and the “pro” camp now accept that only renewables are capable of boosting low-carbon electricity production short-term, Canfin said, while Germany is “evolving” to view nuclear as “part of the solution, not part of the problem”. A generational shift in Europe’s green movement – now driven more by concern about the climate crisis than, as was once the case, opposition to nuclear – should help, he said, with the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg criticising Germany’s shutdown as “a mistake”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T18:36:50Z","webTitle":"UK sets new record for wind power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/03/uk-sets-new-record-for-turbine-power-generation-after-period-of-low-wind","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain has set a new record for wind generation as power from onshore and offshore turbines helped boost clean energy supplies late last year. National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO), which handles Great Britain’s grid, said that a new record for wind generation was set on 30 December, when 20.91 gigawatts (GW) were produced by turbines. This represented the third time Britain’s fleet of wind turbines set new generation records in 2022. In May, National Grid had to ask some turbines in the west of Scotland to shut down, as the network was unable to store such a large amount of electricity when a then record 19.9GW of power was produced – enough to boil 3.5m kettles. The ESO said a new record was also set for the share of electricity on the grid coming from zero-carbon sources – renewables and nuclear – which supplied 87.2% of total power. These sources have accounted for about 55% to 59% of power over the past couple of years. The surge in wind generation represents a remarkable reversal in fortunes as a cold snap that enveloped Britain and Europe quickly turned to milder weather. Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills. The cold weather came with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero. Emergency coal-fired power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby but ultimately not used, while gas-fired generation accounted for nearly 60% of the UK’s power output at times. However, milder weather in the UK and Europe in recent days has led to a reduction in demand from consumers and a fall in wholesale gas prices. It has also reduced the risk of power cuts this winter, which National Grid had warned could be a possibility. Wind generation is seen as a crucial part of Britain’s move towards net zero. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is expected to overturn a moratorium on new onshore wind projects with a consultation on the matter due to run until March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"British households and firms cut enough peak-time energy use to power 10m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"Households and businesses in Great Britain moved enough of their energy use to non-peak times last winter to power 10m homes and help avoid blackouts. About 1.6m households and businesses received payments to help reduce the pressure on the National Grid during the winter months as part of a demand flexibility scheme run by its electricity system operator (ESO). The energy users were called on about 22 times to reschedule their energy use to avoid peak demand hours, for example, running dishwashers or tumble dryers at night. The energy savings from peak time were equivalent to the electricity output of the Keadby gas power plant over 4.5 hours, or three hours of generation from the Sizewell B nuclear power plant. In return, the households and small businesses received payments totalling millions of pounds through their suppliers. Octopus Energy said it paid a total of £5.3m to the customers who signed up. British Gas confirmed it made a total of £1.8m in payments to customers on behalf of the ESO. Claire Dykta, the ESO’s head of markets, said the scheme successfully demonstrated “the interest of UK consumers and businesses in playing a more active role in balancing our electricity needs”. She said: “We are now working with industry and consumers to establish how this world-leading service can grow from strength to strength and support the continued evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK.” ESO is expected to run the scheme again next winter. Countries across Europe took steps to reduce their energy consumption over the last winter after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused market prices to sky-rocket and raised fears over whether there would be enough gas imports to meet demand. Industry data has shown that Great Britain used 5% less gas in the first quarter of this year compared with the same months last year, in part because of lower demand for electricity overall and the growing fleet of windfarms. Wind turbines generated more electricity than gas-fired power plants for the first time in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis of ESO data by Imperial College London. The quarterly report, commissioned by Drax, showed that electricity demand fell by 4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. At the same time, wind power generation increased by 3% to make up 32.4% of Great Britain’s total electricity mix, while gas power made up 31.7%. Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and the lead author of the report, said: “There are still many hurdles to reaching a completely fossil fuel-free grid but wind out supplying gas for the first time is a genuine milestone event, and shows what can be achieved when governments create a good environment for investors in clean technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/05/uk-us-or-a-hybrid-intense-speculation-as-australias-170bn-nuclear-submarine-choice-looms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T19:00:31Z","webTitle":"UK, US or a hybrid?

The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, this week warned against opting for a new UK design. For now though, the Aukus submarine program is a “black box”, says Tom Corben, a foreign policy and defence research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “We’re just speculating until we get the announcement,” he says, adding that the secret has been very well kept, considering the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is set to go to the US to announce it in March. And that speculation is running almost as hot as it was in 2016, when France, Germany and Japan were competing to build a replacement for Australia’s ageing Collins class fleet. France won, then lost in 2021 when the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, scuppered the plan to buy 12 of their conventional Attack class submarines in favour of the Aukus plan for “at least” eight nuclear-powered submarines. The conversation, when it started, was about whether Australia would buy a US or a UK boat. Both of their existing offerings are bigger than the Collins class, and require a bigger crew. Both of their nuclear reactors are designed to last the life of the boat, which can stay submerged until food or the crew’s patience runs out. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But both countries are also already working on their next-generation submarines. The US is currently building 19 Virginia class submarines (known as SSNs, the US classification code for nuclear-powered attack submarines – as opposed to SSBNs, which are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines). These are more than 140m long and require a crew of 132. They displace (or weigh) more than 10,000 tonnes and carry Tomahawk cruise missiles. From the mid 2030s, the Virginia class will be replaced with the next-generation SSN(X). That “X” means the design hasn’t been finalised yet. The US navy has described it as an “apex predator” that will be faster, stealthier, and bristling with more weapons. The UK’s Astute class also carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, which allow the submarine to hit targets 1,000kms away and send back images of the battlefield. It also has Spearfish torpedos designed to destroy enemy submarines. It has a crew of about 100, is almost 100m long and has displacement of 16,000 tonnes. The UK, too, is thinking about the next generation. The SSN(R), which is still being designed, will replace the Astutes. In times of increasing uncertainty, the Aukus nations are looking for more capability. But the technical specifications are only part of the decision-making process for Australia, which is facing a capability gap as the Collins is set to retire before any new submarines are likely to be available. These are not submarines that can be plucked “off the shelf” from some global supermarket. The newer ones, still in the design phase, are years away from even starting trials. The older ones are desperately needed by their own navies. And the timelines are stretching out into the 2040s, leaving experts worried about how Australia will fill its capability gap. The US industrial base is almost overwhelmed constructing its own submarine fleets and there have been warnings that it could not stretch to helping Australia as well. “The bottom line is that the US is not going to build the subs on its own,” Corben says. That reinforces the idea that the endeavour will be split between the three nations. “I would have expected a US combat system to be part of this new submarine as a baseline assumption,” he says. “The real question is where the primary frame construction takes place. Some of that could conceivably happen in Australia if our shipbuilding capabilities are brought up to speed and capacity.” Increasingly the UK and Australian ministers have been hinting at a trilateral design, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, Sam Roggeveen, says. “The open question in my mind is whether that’s some version of the SSN(X) or SSN(R) or is it a new thing altogether,” he says. A totally new design would set off warning lights, he says, pointing to the problems Australia has had with Sea Sprite helicopters, the Collins class and the Attack class. “We’ve been down the road before of buying highly bespoke capabilities for our forces, which no one else has and it’s ended in disaster.” “It’s a price thing … it’s riskier as well because you’re doing something that hasn’t been done before.” Dutton, the former Coalition defence minister, used a series of media conferences and interviews this week to fire a pre-emptive warning shot against going for a new UK design. He said he believed the US Virginia class was the best choice for Australia because it was least risky and could be ready soonest. “I worry that if the government has taken a decision to go for a cheaper design that it will delay the delivery of those submarines,” Dutton said on Wednesday. The Labor government rebuked Dutton for his “irresponsible” public interventions – saying he was basing his views on out-of-date advice – and said it was important that Aukus remain a bipartisan endeavour. Despite airing those misgivings, Dutton promised to support the government’s eventual decision. Submarine analyst and past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, rear admiral (ret’d) Peter Briggs, says the SSN(R) is the frontrunner. The SSN(X) will be too big, he says. “The bigger it is, the more crew it carries and the more expensive it is to own.” Briggs points to the government’s emphasis on “at least” eight boats. “We’re a two-ocean country and we need six on each coast,” he says. “From six you have two ready to go at any time.” That’s the law of three, he says. At any point you have one out, one getting ready to go out, and one being serviced after having been out. Building 12 boats, he says, would make us an important enough customer that we could influence the design and perhaps restrict its size – the Collins class has a displacement of less than 3,500 tonnes and a crew of about 50. After Albanese announces where the new submarine will come from, some of the more difficult questions will need to be answered – about where the workforce will come from, whether everyone will willingly and easily share their technology, whether a hybrid build risks Australia’s sovereign control and – importantly – when the submarines will actually be ready."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-23T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"Recapturing excess heat could power most of Europe, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/23/recapturing-excess-heat-could-power-most-of-europe-say-experts","fields":{"bodyText":"Excess heat produced across Europe could almost power the entire region but preventing this waste is largely being ignored as a solution to the energy crisis, say environmental experts. “The global energy crisis is a wakeup call to stop wasting energy,” said Toby Morgan, senior manager for the built environment at Climate Group, an environmental not-for-profit. “Now, more than ever, we need to make better use of the energy we already produce, we simply can’t afford to let it literally escape out the window. Energy efficiency improvements, like capturing and recycling excess heat, are absolutely critical to lower fossil fuel demand and lower bills.” A report published this week by the global engineering company Danfoss estimated that in the EU alone, excess heat was equal to 2,860 TWh a year, almost the same as the EU’s total energy demand for heat and hot water. Surplus heat is released into the air from a wide range of sources, including supermarkets, transport networks, data centres and commercial buildings. Much of this can be captured and used via existing heat recovery technologies, such as heat pumps, plus more efficient air conditioners and manufacturing machinery according to the authors of the report. Other solutions include improved urban planning and district energy systems based on networks of renewable energy supplies for both heating and cooling. Brian Vad Mathiesen, a professor in energy planning and renewable energy systems at Aalborg University, led the research cited in the report that builds on his team’s previous Heat Roadmap Europe projects. “The amount of cities, regions and countries in Europe which waste heat while spending billions on natural gas or electric heating is mind-blowing,” said Vad Mathiesen, warning that Europe’s energy security was at stake. “Take the Netherlands – there is virtually no district heating even though there is almost twice the amount of waste heat compared to the heat demand. Denmark is the same size but has towards 60% percent district heating with only one third of the population. The use of waste heat is certainly not connected to technical differences. While the physical laws are the same, the political will and traditions are very different.” There was “huge, unharnessed potential” to the excess heat produced by heavy industry, such as chemical manufacturing, steel and cement production. In the EU, that amounts to more than 267 TWh a year, more than the combined heat generation of Germany, Poland and Sweden in 2021. Data centres are also major consumers of electricity. In 2020, European data centres consumed about 3.5% of the region’s electricity demand, according to ReUseHeat, an EU project that explored barriers to urban heat recovery. The report highlights that the UK has an abundance of excess energy, including from 456 data centres. “That’s third most in the world, just behind Germany and the US,” explains Kim Fausing, the president and chief executive of Danfoss, who believes recycling heat is a crucial step towards a green transition. “If businesses were to harness all the excess heat from these centres, the emissions savings and revenue from selling this heat would be highly significant. In Greater London, we have identified at least 648 eligible excess heat sources, including data centres, underground stations, supermarkets, wastewater treatment plants, and food production facilities. Why aren’t businesses and local government organisations using these?” said Fausing, adding that London’s excess heat equated to 9.5 TWh a year, roughly the amount of heat required to heat 790,000 households. “Reusing excess heat offers incredible opportunities for businesses throughout the UK to reduce their emissions, save money and make money. What are we waiting for?” To rapidly tackle the energy crisis, Vad Mathiesen proposes a heat planning directive that enables local authorities to plan according to local conditions. This would involve mapping existing waste heat sources in greater detail, then proposing thermal networks that distribute heat more effectively and initiatives that improve energy efficiency in buildings. “Energy efficiency needs to be a top priority for any business or government, particularly during an energy crisis,” said Morgan, who advises every corporate net zero commitment to include a time-bound energy efficiency target, and for governments to incentivise the uptake of energy efficient technologies. “Energy efficiency improvements are climate critical. The time for action is now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/11/morning-mail-hawaii-wildfires-declared-major-disaster-activist-says-police-pulled-gun-on-him-world-cup-fever-grows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T20:40:13Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Hawaii wildfires declared major disaster, activist says police pulled gun on him, World Cup fever grows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/morning-mail-hawaii-wildfires-declared-major-disaster-activist-says-police-pulled-gun-on-him-world-cup-fever-grows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/morning-mail-hawaii-wildfires-declared-major-disaster-activist-says-police-pulled-gun-on-him-world-cup-fever-grows","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. The drone attack came a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. For Kyiv the strike represented an unprecedented operation to disrupt the Kremlin strategy of trying to cripple the Ukrainian electrical grid to provoke a humanitarian catastrophe in a country on the verge of winter. Shelling by Ukrainian forces killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city on Tuesday, according to the Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin. The head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council, Maria Pirogova. Russian and Ukrainian authorities confirmed the exchange of 120 people in a prisoner swap. According to the Russian defence ministry, 60 servicemen were returned from “Kyiv-controlled territory”. Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Kremlins spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, told the Guardian he had been unable to leave Donetsk after spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine because he did not have any identity papers. Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. Latvia has revoked a broadcast licence for TV Rain, the independent Russian TV station broadcasting from exile, following a scandal over its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The channel had been charged with failing to provide Latvian subtitles in its coverage and for having displayed a map that showed Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russian forces in 2014, as part of Russia. The European Commission is reportedly considering a ban on new investments in Russia’s mining sector as part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow, aimed at further eroding the Kremlin’s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Sources have told the Financial Times that the mining investment ban is part of a ninth EU sanctions package, which officials aim to discuss with member states and have agreed by the end of next week. If approved, the ban, which the paper writes will exempt some specific products, would mark the first time Brussels has directly targeted Russia’s metals sector. The FT said the new sanctions package could also include export controls on civilian technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks, and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals. Ukraine’s health ministry has asked regional authorities to consider suspending non-essential surgeries and hospitalisations due to power blackouts as a result of Russian missile strikes targeting the country’s critical infrastructure. In a statement, the ministry said hospitals were continuing to provide emergency care but that planned surgeries should be temporarily suspended to ease the load on the medical system amid potential future blackouts. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where people have been marking the country’s Army Day today. Earlier we reported that the chair of Latvia’s broadcasting regulator, Ivars Abolins, said it had cancelled the licence of the exiled Russian independent television station, TV Rain, “in connection with the threat to the national security and public order”. TV Rain, or Dozhd in Russian, moved to broadcasting from Latvia in July, when it was forced to shut its Moscow studio after accusations by Russia’s communications watchdog that it was spreading “deliberately false information about the actions of Russian military personnel” in Ukraine. The station was earlier this month fined €10,000 by the Latvian regulator for displaying a map of Russia which included the occupied Crimea peninsula. It was also forced to apologise to viewers and fired a presenter, Alexei Korostelyov, on Friday for comments he made on air, after he said he hoped that the station’s efforts would help provide Russian soldiers with basic equipment and amenities. The network, which was founded in 2010 as the main opposition channel in Russia, has also been accused of failing to ensure Latvian language translation, local media reported. Abolins told reporters today that Latvia’s counterintelligence and internal security service had informed his office that the station represented a threat to the country’s security. TV Rain dismissed the accusations as “unfair and absurd” and said its programmes could still be seen on YouTube, which is where most of its audience watches its content. Its founder, Natalya Sindeeva, posted a video this afternoon describing Korostelyov’s firing as “the worst thing we could have done in that situation”. The move comes as Latvia faces a growing rift between the country’s Latvian majority and its Russian-speaking minority. A quarter of the population of two million in Latvia are Russian speakers. The charity Reporters without Borders called the move a “serious blow to freedom of information”. Several other Russian newsrooms have also found refuge in the Latvian capital, including Novaya Gazeta Europe and Deutsche Welle’s Moscow branch. The city has also hosted independent news website Meduza since 2014. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the move showed foreign states were no freer than Russia. He told reporters today: Some always think that elsewhere is better than home. And some always think that freedom is elsewhere and there is no freedom at home. This is one of the clearest examples that demonstrate the fallacy of such illusions. Moldova’s prime minister, Natalia Gavrilița, has pledged to boost cooperation between her country and Ukraine during a visit to the towns of Bucha and Irpin. In a series of tweets, Gavrilița said justice would be carried out for “the innocent victims that died, were tortured and hurt during this cruel and unjust war unleashed by Russia”. She added: Ukraine is fighting for us all – for the freedom of the entire European continent. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted about his meeting with his Moldovan counterpart, saying that the pair had agreed to cooperate in air defence, energy and customer control. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, has said.

Ukraine received 60 prisoners in return, said Andrii Yermak, Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, said. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities.

Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and that an analysis indicated it was a “planned and large-scale” attack. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. A US national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in the summer has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he did not have any identity papers. In a phone interview from the city of Donetsk, the capital of the Russian-annexed Donetsk region, Murekezi said: I am very happy to be free. But I don’t know what to do next. The Russians never gave me back my passport, and I feel trapped here. Murekezi spent most of his time in two different jails with a group of international foreign fighters, including the British nationals Aiden Aslin, John Harding, Andrew Hill and Dylan Healy, who returned to the UK after a prisoner swap in September. But unlike the foreign fighters, Murekezi and his close friends and relatives said he did not participate in any fighting in Ukraine, to where he moved about four years ago, eventually settling in Kherson. “It became clear early on to the Russian authorities that I had nothing to do with the fighting, but they just kept me in jail anyway,” he said. Read the full story here: The Russian-installed head of the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Alexey Kulemzin, said shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed at least six civilians in the Russian-controlled city today. Kulemzin wrote on social media: Preliminary data shows that today six civilians were killed as a result of shelling in Donetsk, the number of wounded is being specified. Separately, the head of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian shelling had killed a deputy in the self-proclaimed republic’s People’s Council. Maria Pirogova, who Pushilin said had been involved in the separatist movement since 2014, was “the epitome of kindness” whose life was ended “in its prime”, according to a tribute he wrote on his Telegram account. The number of Russian-affiliated oil tankers “going dark” to avoid being tracked in the south Pacific has doubled in recent months in a sign of clandestine means being deployed to avoid sanctions. By switching off their tracker systems on the high seas, the ships can quietly transfer oil on to tankers without links to Russia so as to avoid their oil exports being flagged. A $60 (£50) a barrel ceiling on purchases of Russian oil came into force on Monday. Companies in the EU, the UK, US, Canada and Japan as well as Australia are banned from providing services enabling maritime transport, such as insurance, in cases where the price cap has been breached. The G7 nations – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and US – provide insurance services for 90% of the world’s cargo while Greece, an EU member state, is a major player in the shipping industry. The cap is aimed at maintaining the flow of oil to countries such as China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, which have not banned Russian oil imports, while maintaining economic pressure on the Kremlin. A traffic jam of oil tankers built up in Turkish waters on Monday as Turkey’s government demanded proof of insurance cover. Read the full story here: Senior EU officials have vowed to ensure Ukraine gets €18bn in financial aid, after Hungary vetoed the release of the funds. The European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters that the EU must keep its promises to Ukraine. He said: Ukraine is a country at war. It desperately needs our support and we just cannot allow one member state to derail or delay this financial support. Earlier Viktor Orbán’s government was accused of “holding hostage” funds for Ukrainian hospitals and “cynical obstructionism” after Hungary confirmed on Tuesday that it would block €18bn of aid for Ukraine. The EU has promised to underwrite €18bn in cheap loans to Kyiv to keep Ukraine’s government afloat in 2023. The EU’s 26 other member states will now study how to move ahead without Hungary, although hope Budapest can be persuaded to change its mind. The move by the Orbán government is widely seen as an attempt to gain leverage in separate disputes over Hungary’s access to €13bn EU funds. Hungary, which has angered other member states with its sharp criticism of EU sanctions against Russia, may now find it harder to unlock EU funds. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, who chaired the meeting, said Budapest’s decision on €18bn for Ukraine would be considered alongside EU member state approval of Hungary’s coronavirus recovery plan. He added: The money will go to Ukraine: either it will be 27 or 26 member states that take part. We have to be able to send the money to Ukraine. The Green MEP Daniel Freund, a persistent critic of Hungary’s government, accused Orbán of abusing the veto like no one ever before. He said: He even takes funds for Ukrainian hospitals hostage for this … The EU will find ways to support Ukraine even without Hungary. But that means: more time, more effort, more costs. Viktor Orbán could not have given Putin a nicer present today. The centre-right Romanian MEP Siegfried Mureşan said the Hungarian veto was disappointing, adding: It is hard to regard this as anything other than cynical obstructionism. An American national who was arrested by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine in July has been released and is residing without documents in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk. Suedi Murekezi, 35, was detained on 10 June by Russian occupying forces in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, where he had been living for more than three years. After spending more than four months in different prisons and basements in Russian-occupied Ukraine, he told the Guardian on Monday that he had been released by the Moscow-backed Donetsk separatists on 28 October. Murekezi said he had been unable to leave Donetsk because he does not have any identity papers. A Ukrainian presidential adviser has said that Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, as a result of diplomatic pressure and Iran’s own internal political turmoil. Mikhailo Podolyak told the Guardian that Russian forces currently had enough of its own cruise missiles in its stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure like the salvo fired on Monday. Russia has sought to replenish its arsenal with an offer to buy Iranian missiles. The secretary of the security council, Nikolai Patrushev, visited Tehran in November and was reported to have had missiles on his shopping list. But Podolyak said the deal had not gone through yet. “Iran has come under huge diplomatic pressure and the protests have also raised pressure on the government,” he told the Guardian in his Kyiv office. “The government is starting to lose its grip on Iranian society and their inner domestic problems are growing. That’s why they just don’t have time for dealing with Russia. It’s not their priority.” Podolyak said he believed talks were still under way between Moscow and Tehran on missiles, and that as part of its bargaining position the Russian government had offered its own “cut-throats”, referring to experts in crushing dissent, to suppress the nationwide anti-government protests. “So the negotiations are ongoing, but as of today, no missiles have been transferred to Russia,” he said. Podolyak said Ukrainian forces had become adept at defending against Russian missile attacks, claiming to have shot down an estimated 60 of 70 missiles fired on Monday. He said the country, with foreign help, was also working towards making its power grid more resilient, redesigning it to make it easier for one region with access to power to help another that had been cut off. Podolyak, a close aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was also fiercely critical of remarks from Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, in which the French president suggested the west should offer Vladimir Putin security guarantees if he agreed to peace negotiations. “It’s quite weird when you’re not trying to help the victim – and it’s very clear who’s the victim here – but you’re thinking of how to satisfy the murderer,” he said. Russia ran out of Iranian-made drones between two and three weeks ago and is now “anticipating a resupply”, according to western officials. My colleague Dan Sabbagh quotes officials as saying that there are still no signs that Iran has been supplying missiles to Russia. Iran has acknowledged that it had given Russia drones, but said they were sent before the war in Ukraine broke out. The Guardian has seen evidence that at least some of the Iranian-made drones used by Russia in its war were probably supplied after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February. Hungary has vetoed an €18bn aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and EU countries to seek an alternative way to ensure aid can keep flowing to Kyiv in the new year. The move by the Hungarian government has widely been seen as a way for its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to use his approval for Ukraine aid as leverage to secure his country’s share of EU recovery funds. The EU has sought to hold back some funds destined for Budapest because of rule-of-law breaches. The commission will now look at how to “provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January”, the EU’s budget commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said during a public session of the bloc’s finance ministers. Today’s Hungarian veto means decisions on other files on the finance ministers’ agenda – including a minimum corporate tax rate (which Budapest is also blocking), the Hungarian recovery plan and connected €5.8bn in grants, and the decision to freeze €7.5bn of EU funds for Hungary over corruption issues – were also postponed. The Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said: We were not able to adopt the package as a whole but we will not be discouraged. Our ambition remains that we will start disbursements to Ukraine in January. He asked the council to work on “a solution supported by 26 member states”, which would get around Hungary’s veto. The EU’s 27 nations have until 19 December to make a decision. Ukrainian embassies have received more “bloody packages”, according to its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Over the past week, Ukraine said its diplomatic missions in countries across Europe had been targeted with packages soaked in liquid with a distinctive smell and containing animals’ eyes. Kuleba said Ukraine’s embassies in Romania and Denmark received such packages today. As of Friday, Ukraine said 17 embassies had been targeted, indicating that another was delivered on Saturday. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said the packages had been delivered to its embassies in Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Croatia and Italy, to general consulates in Naples and Kraków, and the consulate in Brno in the Czech Republic. On Monday, Spanish police said they had intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga. A Ukrainian embassy employee in Madrid was injured on Wednesday by a letter bomb, which was addressed to Ukraine’s ambassador to Spain. A further four letter bombs were sent on Wednesday to addresses in Spain, including to a Spanish arms manufacturer that has produced rockets donated to Ukraine, as well as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, and the US embassy in Madrid. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Kuleba described what followed the Madrid attack as “more weird” and “even sick”. Asked who he thought was behind the packages, Kuleba said he “feels tempted to name Russia” as it benefits from sowing fear among Ukrainian diplomats. But he added that it could also be someone who sympathises with Russia, so he would await the findings of ongoing investigations. A drone attack set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, western Russia, 175 miles from the Ukrainian border. The governor of the region, Roman Starovoyt, said there had been no casualties and that the fire was “localised”. On Monday, Ukraine appeared to launch drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has not directly taken responsibility for the attacks, but a senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times the drones involved on Monday were launched from Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has confirmed that Moscow and Kyiv exchanged 60 prisoners of war in the latest series of swaps. Among those who were returned to Ukraine included dozens who had defended the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol, he said. The Russian state-owned bank VTB said it was hit by an “unprecedented cyber-attack from abroad”, which it said was the largest cyber-attack in its history. In a statement, it said it was repelling the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, and warned of temporary difficulties in accessing its mobile app and website. The statement reads: The bank’s technological infrastructure is under an unprecedented cyber attack from abroad. The largest not only this year, but in the whole time the bank has operated. It added: An analysis of the DDoS attack indicates that it was planned and large-scale, and its purpose has been to interfere with the operations of banking services, VTB indicates. The majority of requests for bank services during the attack have generated from foreign segments of the internet, though there has also been malicious traffic from Russian IP addresses. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been visiting troops close to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy was pictured meeting soldiers and handing out awards to mark Ukraine’s armed forces day. In a Telegram post, the president thanked troops for their “resilience and strength”, describing them as “an outpost of Ukraine’s independence”. He added: I believe that next time we will meet in our Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia and Ukraine are set to exchange 60 soldiers each in a prisoner swap today, according to Russian officials. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), wrote on Telegram: Another 60-60 exchange with Kyiv is taking place today. Shamsail Saraliev, deputy of the Russian state duma, wrote on his Telegram account: The Russian Ministry of Defence is conducting another exchange of prisoners of war today. Sixty Russian servicemen are returning home. The Russian defence ministry said it had returned 60 soldiers “who were in mortal danger”. My colleague Isobel Koshiw shares a video originally posted by the mayor of Bakhmut, Oleksii Reva, showing the extent of destruction in the key eastern Ukraine town. Russian opposition politicians are appealing to President Vladimir Putin to issue a decree to end the “partial mobilisation” that has seen hundreds of thousands of men called up to fight in Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry announced in October the end to the military mobilisation order that Putin declared the previous month, but legal activists and media noted that only the Russian leader had the authority to end the mobilisation. The Kremlin said Putin would not sign any order, in effect allowing for future waves of mobilisation. The absence of a formal decree to cancel the mobilisation meant those already drafted could not leave the armed forces, according to Emilia Slabunova, an opposition councillor in Karelia in northern Russia. Military lawyers told Reuters that there were at least two cases where commanders refused to discharge servicemen. Slabunova said appeals against these refusals led nowhere, with courts siding with the commanders. She said: We, as councillors, represent our constituents and these appeals from us are the result of numerous appeals from citizens. Similar appeals were seen from opposition deputies in the Moscow, St Petersburg, Pskov and Veliky Novgorod regions, Reuters reports. All are members of the liberal opposition Yabloko party. The appeals said the lack of a decree “creates legal uncertainty” and “allows military commanders to deny citizens their discharge from service”. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said he agreed with comments by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, about the need for lasting peace in Ukraine, but that Moscow does not see the prospect of talks “at the moment”. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday, Blinken said President Vladimir Putin “started this war; he could end it tomorrow” and that there was “always an off-ramp” to end the war in Ukraine. He said: President Zelenskiy has said, we’ve said, others have said, that at some point this will end and it will end almost certainly with diplomacy, with a negotiation. But what I think we have to see is a just and durable peace, not a phony peace. And by that, I mean this: if Russia doesn’t succeed in its current gambit of trying to, in effect, get the Ukrainian people to throw up their hands – and again, they won’t succeed. In response to Blinken’s comments, Peskov said: That the outcome should be a just and durable peace – one can agree with this. But as for the prospects for some sort of negotiations, we do not see any at the moment. He added that in order for talks to happen with potential partners, Russia would need to fulfil the goals of its “special military operation”. Peskov was also asked about reports that Russia is set to launch a new wave of mobilisation of men to fight in Ukraine. As the BBC’s Will Vernon notes, the Kremlin spokesperson did not deny the reports. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over the live blog from Tom Ambrose to bring you all the latest from Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s news so far: A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. At least four people were killed on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, amid Russian strikes during which 60 of 70 missiles were shot down. The strikes targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, the air force said. Energy workers had already begun work on restoring power, said Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Officials said airstrikes destroyed homes in the south, knocked out power in the north and killed at least two people. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Spanish police intercepted three more envelopes containing animal eyes addressed to Ukraine’s embassy in Madrid and its consulates in Barcelona and Málaga, police sources close to the investigation said. Last week, Ukraine said a series of “bloody packages” were sent to its missions across Europe, soon after a letter bomb detonated at Ukraine’s embassy in Spain and police defused others sent to, among others, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Canadian-made parts were found in “kamikaze” Iranian drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine, according to an investigative project from the NGO Statewatch. It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for the time being. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Ukraine was continuing to shell the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, deliberately creating the threat of a possible nuclear catastrophe. Shoigu said Russian forces were taking “all measures” to ensure the safety of the power plant, Europe’s largest, in the face of what he called “nuclear terrorism” from Kyiv, Reuters reported. Ukraine denies shelling the facility, which has been under the control of Russian forces since the first days of the war, and has accused Russia of firing on it. “Our units are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” Shoigu told his military chiefs in a conference call, an abridged transcript of which was published by the defence ministry. “In turn, the Kyiv regime seeks to create the appearance of a threat of a nuclear catastrophe by continuing to deliberately shell the site,” he added. Shoigu said Ukraine had fired 33 large-caliber shells at the plant in the last two weeks. Most had been intercepted by Russian air defences, he said, though “some still hit objects that affect the safe operation of the nuclear power plant”. “We classify these attacks by Ukrainian troops as nuclear terrorism,” he added. Reuters was unable to independently verify the claims. Both Moscow and Kyiv blame each other for attacks on the facility. Kyiv has also accused Moscow of using the plant as a de facto weapons depot. A drone attack has set an oil storage tank on fire at an airfield in Kursk, the Russian region’s governor has said, a day after Ukraine appeared to launch audacious drone attacks on two military airfields deep inside Russian territory. Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region bordering Ukraine, said on the Telegram messaging app there were no casualties from the attack and the fire was “localised”. Video footage posted on social media showed a large explosion lighting up the night sky followed by a substantial fire at the airfield 175 miles (280km) from the Ukrainian border. At daybreak a large column of black smoke was still visible above the site. The power deficit caused by the latest wave of Russian airstrikes on Ukraine will be significantly reduced by Tuesday evening, the Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in televised comments. Missile strikes across Ukraine on Monday destroyed homes and knocked out power in some areas. Ever since Russia launched its brutal war in Ukraine the Kremlin has banked on American conservative political and media allies to weaken US support for Ukraine and deployed disinformation operations to falsify the horrors of the war for both US and Russian audiences, say disinformation experts. Some of the Kremlin’s most blatant falsehoods about the war aimed at undercutting US aid for Ukraine have been promoted by major figures on the American right, from Holocaust denier and white supremacist Nick Fuentes to ex-Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Fox News star Tucker Carlson, whose audience of millions is deemed especially helpful to Russian objectives. On a more political track, House Republican Freedom Caucus members such as Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Scott Perry – who in May voted with 54 other Republican members against a $40bn aid package for Ukraine, and have raised other concerns about the war – have proved useful, though perhaps unwitting, Kremlin allies at times. Pro-Moscow video materials from the network RT (formerly Russia Today), which early this year shuttered its US operations, have been featured on Rumble, a video sharing platform popular with conservatives that last year received major financing from a venture capital firm co-founded by recently elected Republican Ohio senator JD Vance and backed by billionaire Peter Thiel. The Latvian broadcasting regulator cancelled the licence of Russian independent television station TV Rain on Tuesday, the regulator’s chairman said. “In connection with the threat to the national security and public order, [the regulator] has made a decision this morning to annul the broadcast licence of TV Rain”, Ivars Abolins said on Twitter, adding the broadcasts will cease on Thursday. Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase in Russia. Russia’s defence ministry has said it has deployed mobile coastal defence missile systems on a northern Kuril island, part of a strategically located chain of islands that stretch between Japan and the Russian Kamchatka peninsula. Japan lays claim to the Russian-held southern Kuril islands, which Tokyo calls the Northern Territories, a territorial row that dates to the end of the second world war, when Soviet troops seized them from Japan. The Russian Bastion systems, which have missiles with a flight range of up to 310 miles, were deployed on the island of Paramushir, the Russian defence ministry said on Monday. “Coastal servicemen of the Pacific fleet will keep a round-the-clock watch to control the adjacent water area and strait zones,” it said. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a Tuesday news conference that the government will closely monitor the Russian military activity, adding it has been intensifying in the far east regions in tandem with Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls the invasion a “special operation”. Ukraine is working to restore power after Russia’s latest wave of missile strikes on Monday caused power disruptions across the country, as winter frost builds and temperatures plunge, AFP reports. Out of the 70 missiles launched by Moscow, most were shot down, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, but the barrage still hit Ukraine’s already battered infrastructure. Fresh power cuts were announced in all regions “due to the consequences of shelling”, national electricity provider Ukrenergo said on Telegram. The head of Ukrenergo said he had “no doubt that Russian military consulted with Russian power engineers during this attack”, judging by where the missiles landed. “The time that Russians chose for this attack was connected with their desire to inflict as much damage as possible,” Volodymyr Kudrytskyi told a Ukrainian news programme, explaining the attacks were launched as the country enters a “peak frost” period. “Our repairmen will be working on the energy system restoration.” The oil price rebounded on Tuesday after plunging by more than 3% in the previous session, as the implementation of sanctions on Russian seaborne crude oil eased concerns about oversupply, Reuters reports. The Group of Seven set a top price of $60 a barrel on Russian crude, aiming to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war in Ukraine, but Russia has said it will not abide by the measure even if it has to cut production. The price cap, to be enforced by the G7 nations, the European Union and Australia, comes on top of the EU’s embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. While the market weighs the impact of sanctions on Russian supply, it was also watching a traffic jam of oil tankers off the coast of Turkey on Monday, with Ankara insisting on new proof of insurance for all vessels. A researcher at the investigative news outlet Bellingcat has posted video showing smoke rising from Kursk, Russia, where Ukraine launched strikes damaging an oil storage tank, according to the local governor on Telegram. The Guardian could not independently verify the footage or report of an attack. Russia has launched strikes overnight on Zaporizhzhia region, according to Oleksandr Starukh, the head of Zaporizhzhia’s regional military administration, who posted photographs on Telegram in the early hours of Tuesday, 6 December. The strikes damaged critical infrastructure and residential buildings, he said. At this stage there were no injuries or fatalities. Below are the photographs originally posted by Starukh: Starovoyt did not specify where the drone originated. On Monday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine “attempted to strike” the Dyagilevo airfield in the Ryazan region and the Engels airfield in the Saratov region with “Soviet-made drones”. The drones were intercepted but debris fell and exploded on the airfields, the ministry added. It said that three soldiers had been killed and four others injured. The Guardian has not independently verified the report. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens for the next few hours. A drone attack on an airfield in Russia’s Kursk region set fire to an oil storage tank, a local governor said on Tuesday. “There were no casualties. The fire is localized. All emergency services working at the site,” Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the region, said on the Telegram messaging app. Yesterday, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukrainian drones attacked two airbases at Ryazan and Saratov in south-central Russia, killing three servicemen and wounding four, with two aircraft damaged. Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility for what would represent the deepest strikes inside the Russian heartland since Moscow invaded Ukraine on 24 February.

It said components from 30 European and American companies, including antenna parts from Tallysman Wireless, a Canadian manufacturer, were used in Shahed 136 drones. The White House has said the latest Russian strikes against Ukraine are a reminder of Vladimir Putin’s brutality. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, also told reporters that an oil price cap would not have any long-term impact on global oil prices, Reuters reported. Moldovan police on Monday found fragments of a missile in a northern region near the border with Ukraine, state information portal Prima Sursa quoted the police as saying after Russia carried out missile strikes. Russia’s recent mobilisation increased its military threat in Ukraine, with better-trained soldiers arriving at the frontline, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said. But Russia was using a lot of old equipment because it had no other way of replenishing supplies, and the Russians had made only slow progress around Bakhmut, one of the main battle zones in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported. Vladimir Putin has driven across the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and the Crimean peninsula that was damaged by a truck bomb in October. The Russian president spoke to workers and a senior government official, Reuters reported. India gave a list of its products to Moscow for access to Russian markets, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, as his country seeks to narrow a growing trade deficit with Russia at a time when Moscow faces acute shortages of some crucial materials after western sanctions. The Kremlin has warned the new western price cap on Russian oil will destabilise global energy markets, but claimed it would not affect its invasion of Ukraine. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to the move by the G7 and allies. The Chinese foreign ministry has said it will continue energy cooperation with Russia after the G7, EU and Australia imposed the price cap. China, which said it would continue on the basis of respect and mutual benefit, has increased its purchases of Russia’s Urals oil blends this year. Olaf Scholz has warned the west to avoid creating a new cold war by dividing the world into blocs. Writing in an opinion piece for Foreign Affairs magazine, the German chancellor called for every effort to be made to build new partnerships."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/sep/03/trump-tim-kaine-donald-trump-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-03T17:26:43Z","webTitle":"Top Democrat says ‘powerful argument’ 14th amendment disqualifies Trump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/03/trump-tim-kaine-donald-trump-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/sep/03/trump-tim-kaine-donald-trump-2024","fields":{"bodyText":"Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said that he believes there is a “powerful argument” to be made that Donald Trump can be disqualified from running in the 2024 presidential elections under the 14th amendment. “In my view, the attack on the Capitol that day was designed for a particular purpose at a particular moment and that was to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power as is laid out in the constitution,” he said in an interview with ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. “So I think there is a powerful argument to be made.” Kaine, who in 2016 ran for vice-president alongside Hillary Clinton, said that the “language is specific”, referring to the third section of the 14th amendment. “If you give aid and comfort to those who engage in an insurrection against the constitution of the United States, it doesn’t say against the United States, it says against the constitution.” According to the section, “no person shall be a[n] … elector of president and vice-president, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.” It adds that such a clause could be removed via a vote of two-thirds of each House. Speaking to Stephanopoulos, Kaine said that he discussed the section with colleagues at the time of Trump’s second impeachment. He said: “I thought actually it might have been a more productive way to go than the second impeachment to do a declaration under that section of the 14th amendment.” Kaine joins a growing number of legal experts looking to prevent Trump from running for office again under the 14th amendment. An article by two conservative law professors that is set to be published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review examines the clause in light of Trump’s involvement in the 2020 election subversion efforts. The article, written by constitutional scholars William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen, concludes: “Taking section 3 seriously means that its constitutional disqualifications from future state and federal officeholding extend to participants in the attempted overturning of the presidential election of 2020, including former president Donald Trump and others.” Meanwhile, a similar article published last month in the Atlantic by retired conservative federal judge J Michael Luttig and Harvard law professor emeritus Laurence Tribe echoed similar sentiments. “The clause was designed to operate directly and immediately upon those who betray their oaths to the constitution, whether by taking up arms to overturn our government or by waging war on our government by attempting to overturn a presidential election through a bloodless coup,” wrote Luttig and Tribe. “The former president’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and the resulting attack on the US Capitol, place him squarely within the ambit of the disqualification clause, and he is therefore ineligible to serve as president ever again,” they added. The 14th amendment was also brought up during the Republican primary presidential debate last month by former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson. “More people are understanding the importance of that, including conservative legal scholars, who say he may be disqualified under the 14th amendment from being president, again, as a result of the insurrection. This is something that could disqualify him, under our rules, and under the constitution,” Hutchinson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T14:00:12Z","webTitle":"Mark Latham to push for nuclear plants and ‘parental rights’ if made NSW kingmaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","fields":{"bodyText":"Mark Latham will seek to overturn a longstanding ban on nuclear power technologies, strengthen “parental rights” and protect Christians from vilification if One Nation picks up enough seats to make him a kingmaker after the New South Wales election. The former federal Labor leader is attempting to grow his party’s upper house presence from two to four at the 25 March poll, capitalising on voter disillusionment and a loophole that has allowed him to resign and re-run at the top of the ticket. Pollsters and the major parties believe One Nation is in with a shot of picking up at least one extra seat – after securing two in 2019 – which means whoever forms government could have to work with, or around, One Nation to govern. Labor has preferenced the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in key marginal seats in the hopes of stopping One Nation from gaining more power, while the Greens remain nervous they could miss out on a seat to the party. Latham told Guardian Australia his top priority was building on conversations around the Aukus agreement to build nuclear-powered subs by getting around the decades-old federal nuclear power ban, enabling uranium mining and the building of reactors across the state. “I don’t advocate getting rid of the coal-fired power stations, but as the government’s doing it, it’s much much better to have small modular nuclear reactors replacing them,” he said. “The breakthrough on nuclear means it’s more urgent than ever.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Latham also said he wants parents to be given more rights over what their children are taught in schools, which he claimed were full of “semi-illiterate” students. “Parents are being treated as second-class citizens in the education system,” Latham said. “We would ban gender fluidity teaching in NSW schools … [as] the system seems to be obsessed with questions of gender, which has got nothing to do with education. It’s a matter for parents and families.” His third priority was increasing protection for religious groups to deal with the “rise of vilification of Christians, in particular”. But the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, accused Latham of being on a “unity ticket with the ‘teal’ candidates on their shared mission to remove conservative MPs to facilitate a Labor government” – a claim the One Nation leader and the opposition deny. “He pretends he’s a conservative,” Kean told Guardian Australia. Kean also dismissed Latham’s plan to see nuclear energy generation permitted in NSW. “I hope Mark understands that although he has an oversized voice for the number of votes his party attracts, his rantings in NSW parliament can’t be heard in Canberra, where there is actual jurisdiction to amend a commonwealth ban on nuclear power,” he said. Labor has denied doing deals with any crossbenchers, including Latham. “There’s a real possibility that Mark Latham and One Nation could be the kingmaker of NSW politics – on everything from climate change, renewables, education and anti-discrimination,” said an opposition spokesperson, Penny Sharpe. A pollster, Simon Welsh of RedBridge, said the Liberal party risked losing votes at each end of their support spectrum to teals and Labor, as well as more rightwing options. “That dynamic that was there in the federal election is definitely there again … [and] One Nation is very well-positioned – picking up folks that are angry with the government about vaccines and Covid restrictions,” he said. “The other thing that they’ve got working for them this time is that it looks like there’s a bit of consolidation of that rightwing minor-party vote. Whether that then translates into a number of seats is a trickier question.” A Greens spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said she was concerned about seeing far-right parties gaining ground. “The one way that we ensure that Mark Latham is not the kingmaker … is to get a commitment out of both government and the opposition that they will not work with the likes of One Nation because of the toxic politics they represent,” she said. “It is quite possible that that last spot in the upper house would be between [Greens candidate] Lynda-June Coe and One Nation.” The comments came ahead of Coe, a Wiradjuri and Badu Island woman, releasing the Greens’ plan to stop First Nations deaths is custody on Thursday. It will include co-designing and enacting a justice reinvestment plan, creating a new independent police and prison oversight mechanism and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14, with no one under 16 able to be sentenced to a jail term. Despite being just four years into his eight-year term, Latham last year announced he would quit parliament at the election, allowing the party to fill his vacated seat under parliamentary rules while he runs at the top of One Nation’s ticket. At the time Latham defended the run as a chance to “renew” his mandate but analysts believe he was using a loophole to increase the party’s chances of bolstering numbers to four, with one saying it raised ethical – but not any legal – concerns. The election analyst Ben Raue noted even if One Nation claimed four seats, the makeup of the rest of the chamber would decide the party’s actual power. “They could potentially have the balance of power but they could also be in a position where they’re just not that relevant,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-10T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Power play: the Lebanese board game with a political point to make","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/apr/10/power-play-the-lebanese-board-game-with-a-political-point-to-make-machrou3-ra2is","fields":{"bodyText":"In a dimly lit room in Beirut, five friends sit around a table with a map of Lebanon in the middle. They each have a handful of markers and a card placed face-down in front of them. The card, which has a drawing of a vintage chair on the back – symbolising power – determines the entire game. It assigns you the secret role of either “reformist” or “corrupt elite”. “It is just like in real life, you don’t know who is corrupt and who is not,” says Jean-Michel Chemaly, one of the developers of the board game. Machrou3 Ra2is: A Game of Corruption was released in December, giving people a chance to play the political game of Lebanon. The task is to control districts and, ultimately, win the presidential election – either through bluff or fair play. Chemaly says the idea came during the protests in 2019, when large numbers of Lebanese came out on the streets. A friend, Benoit Khayat, suggested that they create a game based on the politicians’ actions. “Every single society has people abusing power for their own benefit. We wanted to speak about it from a Lebanese perspective,” Chemaly says. The issues that people mobilised around in 2019 – corruption, accountability, justice – have become even more pressing. Lebanon has sunk deep into a financial crisis, with one of the highest levels of inflation in the world and a 98% depreciation of its currency. A fledgling anti-corruption movement has lost momentum. Millions have lost money, and are unable to access what little is left due to bank limits on withdrawals. As a consequence, 80% of the population face poverty, the UN estimates. Politically, the country is in a vacuum. In last year’s elections more reform-minded candidates than ever before ran for seats, and parties affiliated with the protest movement got 13% of the popular vote. But the country has been without a president since. In addition, no one has been charged for the huge explosion in the port of Beirut in August 2020, which killed more than 200 people. “We have absolutely no say in the politics of the country. Creating the game was a way of bringing about some agency,” says Rana Zaher, the game’s illustrator. Her aim was to make the game look like “something you would find in your grandma’s closet”. The map has a vintage feel, with stains and smudges. The characters from camp “reform” and camp “corrupt” all wear styles from the 1950s. One smokes a slim cigarette, another holds up a camera with a handheld flash. A man with a fez on his head poses with a vintage gun. “I won’t name any names but the characters are modelled after real political figures,” Zaher says. All the reformists are drawn in dark red, the corrupt characters in green. “Green symbolises sickness and death, and isthe colour of money, of course,” she says. The idea was to set the game in Lebanon’s golden age, and pose the question of whether circumstances then were setting the scene for the crisis today. “We wanted to know how we got to where we are today. You have to go back 100 years to find out what went wrong,” Chemaly says. It is not the first board game to look for new ways to explore politics and history. In 2019, Indian developers launched Shasn, Sanskrit for “governance”, where questions about ethics determine whether you’re an “idealist”, a “capitalist” or a “showman”. An updated version of the 2002 game Puerto Rico, which originally had players in the role of colonial governors, was released last year. The original game had faced criticism for its portrayal of colonialism, failing to include the experiences of people who lived through it. The new version is set in post-independence Puerto Rico. That game led to the creation of the “counter-colonialist” game Promesa, where players can learn about the Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. It is named after the 2016 law that handed control of the island’s finances to the US. Machrou3 Ra2is is on sale in shops throughout Lebanon and online, and has sold 500 copies so far. At a comic convention in Abu Dhabi in March, the team sold the game to visitors from Qatar, Australia and the Philippines. Chemaly says the game, which is in English, can be played by people anywhere to help people see what real life corruption looks like. “It depicts the struggle of every country in the world, people trying to make sure that the good guys get to power,” he says. Around the table, the game is drawing to a close. The final vote for president turns into an extended debate with everyone trying to call each other’s bluff– proof that it has been a good round, Chemaly says. “When it ends with a 30-minute discussion, you know you had a good game.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T14:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Power of Language by Viorica Marian review – the virtues of multilingualism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/07/the-power-of-language-by-viorica-marian-review-the-virtues-of-multilingualism","fields":{"bodyText":"Disclosure: this reviewer is pi-lingual, a word coined by Douglas Hofstadter to describe people who speak three languages and can also have a cringingly inept conversation with a taxi driver in a couple more. Any book like this one, which purports to prove scientifically that polyglots are superior, has my vote. All the more since no great diligence was required of me to achieve this, aside from tagging along with my parents and a couple of patient English girlfriends met at an impressionable age. I therefore picked up this account of the virtues of multilingualism in smug mode, channelling my son who, at age 7, was fond of starting conversations with strangers with “I speak three languages, how many do you speak?”, which unsurprisingly won him few friends. I was not prepared for the number of scientific reasons this (overlong) book provides for additional smugness and fewer friends. Viorica Marian, who was born in Moldova, speaking Russian and Romanian, immigrated to the US and is now a professor at Northwestern University, has clearly made a living out of making monolingual colleagues – which in her neck of the woods must be a majority – feel inadequate. The first half of The Power of Language is a relentless, and eloquently written, studies-have-shown gallop through her work and that of her peers. All of which supposedly demonstrates, ad nauseam, that polyglots are measurably better than monoglots at almost everything: smarter, more inventive, more adaptable. They also have less (and later) dementia, more emotional detachment in their learned languages, better “multisensory integration” and their brain has been literally reshaped by language. Some of the statements made are hair-raisingly daft – only a closeted academic could write: “Authors of a recent study suggest that the memory abilities of an 80‐year‐old woman with a bachelor’s degree would be on average as good as those of a 60‐year‐old woman with a high school education and interpreted the four extra years of education as making up for the memory losses associated with 20 years of ageing”. This is ivory tower tosh. University education has nothing in particular to do with memory, and memory loss with age very little to do with university education. Cultures with oral traditions demanded prodigious feats of memory from their storytellers and listeners, and awarded no bachelor’s degrees that I’ve heard of. The superiority of polyglots is supported by dozens of scientific articles reporting various clever experimental psychological tests and further articles measuring changes in blood flow in different areas of the brain using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI for short. None of this, by the way, tallies with my own experience. I have quite simply never noticed a difference in anything nontrivial between the people I know who speak many languages and those who do not. But science, according to Prof Marian, tells us otherwise. And that is where the problem lies, because the science may be bunk. Psychology and fMRI are both going through what is politely known in the trade as a “replication crisis” meaning that many studies claiming statistically significant results – effects that could not have arisen by chance – cannot be reproduced by other researchers. Much soul-searching is going on at the moment and the consensus is that practitioners need to up their game. Some of the field’s contradictions are evident in this book: all of fMRI is predicated on the notion that a brain area that performs a task lights up in the images produced by the machine. Yet Marian asserts “polyglots and hyperpolyglots used fewer neural resources to process language. [They] may be making more efficient use of neural resources for language processing”. In other words, if it lights up it’s working – and if it doesn’t light up it’s working even better. You see the problem. Midway through the book Marian switches gears from her area of expertise to a broader and shallower survey of language in general, which reads, at times, like a grab-bag of factoids. Spanish has two words to refer to a corner, one from the inside (rincòn) and one from the outside (esquina). We are told that as a result: “Speakers of Spanish have better memory for where items are presented in a display that involves corners than speakers of English”. If you believe that, as the Duke of Wellington said to a man who addressed him as “Mr Jones, I believe”, you’ll believe anything."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/28/big-changes-needed-power-sharing-northern-ireland-says-70-of-population","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T09:01:30Z","webTitle":"Big changes needed to power sharing in Northern Ireland, says 70% of population","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/big-changes-needed-power-sharing-northern-ireland-says-70-of-population","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/big-changes-needed-power-sharing-northern-ireland-says-70-of-population","fields":{"bodyText":"More than two-thirds of people in Northern Ireland believe big changes are required to the power-sharing institutions created by the Good Friday agreement, research commissioned by a parliamentary committee has found. The same proportion of the population, 70%, think the peace accord of 1998 has failed to deliver stable governance with the Stormont assembly not sitting for nine of the 25 years that have elapsed since the Belfast agreement was struck. The research was conducted by YouGov and Ohio State University for the House of Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee. That level of scepticism about the deal’s success in delivering stability remained consistent across age, religion and political affiliation. The committee chair, Simon Hoare, said the poll provided an “important snapshot” of current thinking in the region. The devolved government sitting in Stormont was created under strand one of the Belfast Good Friday agreement, which was considered an ingenious way of getting previously warring sides, republicans and loyalists to run the country together. Under the power-sharing system, elected politicians are required to self-designate as unionists, nationals or “other” to ensure laws could only be passed that worked for all communities. A quarter of a century on, and three-quarters of the respondents in the survey consider the requirement that key decisions have to have support from both nationalist and unionist sides gives the DUP and Sinn Féin an effective veto, with growing parties such as Alliance locked out. Stormont was collapsed for three years after a Sinn Féin walkout in 2017 and has been suspended for more than a year after the DUP pulled the plug in a protest over Brexit. Support for reform is widespread but Bertie Ahern, one of the architects of the peace deal, has said it could only happen once the DUP was back in Stormont. The party, led by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said it would not be “browbeaten” into a return and few are expecting it to resume power-sharing until September. Donaldson faced a cacophony of calls to return to Stormont in Belfast last week with leading figures involved in the peace deal, including Bill Clinton, urging politicians to face down “ugly” moments and “get the show on the road”. “I ask you not to be discouraged, this is human affairs, there are very few permanent victories or defeats in human affairs. All these old ugly problems are always rearing their heads. You just have to suck it up and beat it back and deal with it,” Clinton told a conference at Queen’s University."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-10T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"Japan’s climate policy ‘failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","fields":{"bodyText":"Apart from the distant buzz of a gardener’s strimmer, all is quiet at the Kyoto International Conference Center, its grey concrete walls matched by the sky on an afternoon in early December. Autumn leaves still cling to branches in the nearby forest, where groups of hikers plot their course in light trousers and T-shirts, as if to remind passersby of why Japan’s ancient capital became synonymous with the climate crisis. The venue – best known for its appearance in the 1974 Robert Mitchum film The Yakuza – is deserted. Its doors are locked and signs dotting its lawns warn non-authorised personnel to keep out. It is a far cry from the frantic activity of 25 years ago, when hundreds of journalists and campaigners, fuelled by coffee and takeaway bento boxes, awaited news of a breakthrough at Cop3 – the world’s first serious attempt to wean itself off fossil fuels. On 11 December 1997, after negotiations that ran through the night, the Kyoto protocol was born, committing 160 parties – later 192 – to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% between 2008 and 2012. The summit’s Japanese hosts hailed the agreement as a major breakthrough – the first time developed and developing countries had signed up to legally binding CO2 reduction targets. “Cop3 was a good start, because it showed that the world had to change,” said Kenro Taura, executive director of Kiko Network, a Kyoto-based NGO. “Until then, most countries were determined to pursue economic growth based around the use of fossil fuels, but Kyoto convinced them that was not the right approach.” The protocol was also an important step towards the Paris climate agreement. Derided by some as a failure because of the US refusal to ratify it, the agreement had some notable successes. It set out a global system of carbon trading, and in establishing many of the technical aspects of carbon accounting that are still in use, in modified forms, today. The “top-down” system of setting countries’ emissions-cutting targets has since been abandoned in favour of “bottom-up” commitments known as nationally determined contributions, but the understanding that rich countries must take responsibility for their historic role in the climate crisis endures, and was one of the flashpoints at last month’s Cop27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. “The Kyoto protocol is regarded as an important milestone in climate action, as it was the first opportunity for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Japan’s environment ministry said. “In response to the Kyoto protocol, Japan will drive emission reductions not only in Japan but also in developing countries where emissions have increased significantly, thus contributing to the global emission reductions.” The anniversary of the protocol, which came into force in 2005 – minus the US – passed almost unnoticed in its host city this week. Yet the absence of fanfare is misleading. In the quarter of a century since the summit, Kyoto city has positioned itself at the forefront of efforts to address climate change, even if Japan’s government has been found wanting. In 2019, Kyoto became the first Japanese city to announce a net zero target by 2050, and, in March 2021, the first to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an international campaign to move away from coal-fired power generation. In the two decades after Cop3, Kyoto halved the amount of waste it generated and cut energy consumption by 31%, according to Sayoko Matsumoto, manager of the city’s Do You Kyoto?project – named in honour of former German chancellor Angela Merkel, who used those words during a visit to the city in 2007 as a way of asking people if they were taking action to save the planet. Kyoto was one of four Japanese cities to be named to CDP’s A-List for 2022 in recognition of its “bold action” on climate change. On the 16th of every month, – the date in February 2005 when the protocol went into effect – outdoor lighting is dimmed or turned off, commuters are encouraged to swap their cars for public transport and diners eat in restaurants lit by candles and lamps. “The city feels a responsibility to lead on climate change, and that’s part of the legacy of Cop3,” Matsumoto said. “A lot of people in Kyoto may be too young to remember the actual summit, but they are aware of the climate crisis and the need to cooperate to help Kyoto achieve its net zero target.” Japan’s government, by contrast, has struggled to build on the Cop3 legacy. As of last year, renewables accounted for just over 20% of Japan’s energy generation – significantly lower than Germany (49% in the first half of 2022) and Britain (39%). Nuclear accounts for just under 7%, with coal, oil and liquefied natural gas dominating Japan’s energy generation with a 74% share. Its role in financing major oil, gas and coal projects earned Japan – the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of greenhouses gases – a “fossil award” from the Climate Action Network at the Cop27 summit. More than a decade after the Fukushima crisis forced Japan to close reactors and increase fossil fuel imports, the government is again turning to nuclear to help it achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, to the dismay of environmental campaigners who believe the focus should be on renewables. “The Japanese government is using the ‘we will do it with nuclear’ mantra as a way of delaying real work on climate change,” said Aileen Smith, executive director of Green Action. “Nuclear power is expensive,” Smith said, citing plans by Kansai Electric Power, which serves the region where Kyoto is located, to spend over ¥1tn (£5.9bn) over the next five years on climate change, with 70% of that investment earmarked for the nuclear sector. “It means money will be spent on a less effective, more expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions. And it won’t be that long-lasting, since the nuclear plants are old.” There was little evidence of any desire to burnish Kyoto’s legacy among the Japanese delegation at Cop27. Japan played a low-key role during the two-week conference, supporting moves to reaffirm the global target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but without taking a significant public stance on the issue. The country’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, did not attend the summit, putting him out of step with more than 100 world leaders who did. Taura said Japan’s enthusiasm for nuclear restarts and cautious embrace of renewables showed that Japan had “learned nothing” from the Kyoto protocol or the triple meltdown in Fukushima. “I think Europe has done more to take action that matches the spirit of the Kyoto protocol,” he said. “But Japan has consistently made the wrong choices. The decision to put increased nuclear power generation at the centre of its climate change policy is another setback to energy conservation and the promotion of renewable energy. Unfortunately, Japan has failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto.” • This article was amended on 12 December 2022. An earlier version referred to an “energy mix”.

Chris Heaton-Harris, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, on Sunday joined a chorus urging the DUP to end a boycott that has paralysed the executive and assembly at Stormont. “Alongside the new councils, it remains my hope to see the assembly and executive return to work,” he said. Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and putative first minister, said her party’s performance in the 18 May council elections – final results were announced on Saturday night – reflected a desire to revive Stormont. “It is time to make politics work for all people and communities, and to build a better future for everyone,” she said. The appeals came after Sinn Féin made stunning gains and delivered what one former DUP leader said was a “wake up and smell the coffee moment” for unionism. In a contest for 462 seats spanning 11 councils, Sinn Féin swept past its unionist rival to become the dominant force in local government. It won 144 seats, a gain of 39 from the 2019 election when it won 105. It made breakthroughs across the region, including in DUP heartlands. The party almost doubled its vote in Balmoral, Belfast’s most affluent ward. The DUP won 122 seats, unchanged from four years ago. The non-aligned Alliance party won 64, a gain of 14 that vaulted it into third position. The Ulster Unionist party (UUP) slumped to 54 seats, a loss of 21, and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) dropped to 39, a loss of 20. Smaller parties and independents made up the rest. On a turnout of 54.7%, a slight rise from 2019, Sinn Féin won 30.9% of first preference votes, versus 23.3% for the DUP, 13.3% for Alliance, 10.9% for the UUP and 8.7% for the SDLP. The results consolidated Sinn Féin’s success in last year’s assembly elections – when it eclipsed the DUP as the biggest party – and presented unionism with another reminder of its shrivelling demographic and political position. “For unionism, it’s perhaps a ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ moment,” the former DUP leader Edwin Poots told the BBC. Naomi Long, the Alliance leader, called the result a “tsunami” of support for Sinn Féin. Nationalist parties won 19,000 more first preference votes than unionist parties, according to Nicholas Whyte, a psephologist with the consultancy Apco Worldwide. Sinn Féin tapped nationalist resentment at the DUP boycott of power sharing – which has blocked O’Neill from becoming first minister – by making her the focus of a presidential-style campaign that siphoned off SDLP support. However, the DUP’s solid vote reflected a tactical victory for its leader,Jeffrey Donaldson, who faced down challenges on both flanks from the moderate UUP and the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice. Boycotting Stormont to protest post-Brexit trading arrangements has been popular with unionist voters. However, Donaldson is believed to be seeking a way to revive power-sharing without losing face. There is speculation the DUP will do so in the autumn after obtaining further reassurances from Downing Street about Northern Ireland’s position in the UK and a financial package for the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/21/byelection-keir-starmer-tories-labour-leader-conservative","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-21T14:39:44Z","webTitle":"After the byelections, Starmer’s path to power is clear: revulsion at the Tories is essential – but not enough | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/byelection-keir-starmer-tories-labour-leader-conservative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/21/byelection-keir-starmer-tories-labour-leader-conservative","fields":{"bodyText":"Well, that settles nothing. The night of three byelections gave just enough of a split decision for all sides to claim victory. And by all sides, I do not mean the three main parties in England that each chalked up a win. No, I am referring to the factions currently slugging it out within Labour over the best route to power at the next general election. For them, these results offered something for everyone. Start with the unexpected Labour failure to capture Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where Sadiq Khan’s ultra-low emission zone, or Ulez – which imposes a tax on drivers of old, polluting cars – appears to have provoked enough Tory voters to stay loyal. That will embolden those Labour voices, especially in the trade unions, who warn of a “greenlash” – already visible in France, Germany and the Netherlands – among working people reluctant to pay the price for action on the environment. That will give rise to a familiar cry: act on the climate, by all means, but let the cost fall on someone else. The Tories have already spotted the opening, with Jacob Rees-Mogg seeking to brand Labour as the party of “high, green taxes”. (If the Conservatives follow the lead of other rightwing parties and set their face against any policy to tackle the climate crisis, forget the political impact: the victim will be the planet.) Still, the Uxbridge result, like the spectacular win in the deep Tory terrain of Selby and Ainsty, will also be seized on in the wider argument over Labour strategy. The fight is between two groups. One says Labour needs to offer a bold, radical vision that will inspire voters and match the scale of the task now facing a country all but broken by 13 years of Conservative rule. The other says that Labour’s primary task is to reassure the electorate that the party has changed since it was so roundly rejected in 2019, and that it must do nothing that risks it being deemed too irresponsible to be trusted with office. The second group, enthusiasts for the leadership of Keir Starmer, points to Selby as proof that the current approach is working. The first group, which includes much of the left, cites Uxbridge as evidence that it’s not enough. The Starmerites hit back and say that it was precisely a radical policy popular with the left – namely Ulez – that cost them a seat. And round it goes. Where you stand on this argument depends on how you view the next election. Will it be a referendum on the merits of Labour – or will it be what might be called a revulsion election, comparable to the US presidential contest of 2020, when enough Americans were repelled by Donald Trump to do whatever it took to eject him from office? There are good reasons to suggest that the next British general election will be animated by just that kind of revulsion – at the lies of Boris Johnson, the recklessness of Liz Truss and the damage that the Tories have done: to an ailing NHS and a raft of public services, but above all to the economy, mortgage rates and millions of Britons’ ability to make ends meet. In this context, the first task of the opposition is to become an acceptable vehicle for that revulsion, to remove all possible obstacles that might stand in the way of voters thinking of crossing over from right to left. Joe Biden pulled that off for the Democrats: he offered none of the charisma or oratorical fire of Barack Obama; he excited almost nobody. But he was inoffensive, leaving a small barrier for any would-be defector to clear. Starmer has clearly effected the same transformation in Labour, and at an exceptional speed and scale. Recall that the Labour defeat in 2019 was the heaviest since 1935; many forecasted that Johnson would be in Downing Street for a decade. Yet less than four years later, Labour has overturned a 20,000 Tory majority in North Yorkshire. The Liberal Democrat win in Somerton and Frome is part of the same success story. Lib Dems do best when Labour is viewed as sufficiently unscary that voters in previously Conservative seats feel able to turf out a Tory MP. (It was no coincidence that the Lib Dems reached their high-water mark in the era of Tony Blair.) They did not feel that way in 2019, which is why a lot of remain-minded “blue wall” constituencies stuck with a Tory party promising to “get Brexit done”. But Starmer does not scare them. The result is the kind of tactical voting on Thursday that saw Lib Dems lend their votes to Labour in the north of England, with Labour supporters returning the favour in the West Country – depriving the Tories of two rock-solid seats. It is efficient tactical voting that walloped the Conservatives in May’s English local elections – “blue wall” seats for the Lib Dems, “red wall” for Labour – and which could remove Rishi Sunak from power. All of which will hearten the leadership as the party gathers in Nottingham for its National Policy Forum this weekend. They will say that it is their efforts to shake off the legacies of the Jeremy Corbyn years that have delivered double-digit opinion poll leads and massive byelection swings to Labour, and that they have been right to strive for fiscal credibility – even when that means having to forswear promises the party would dearly love to make, such as a commitment to overturn the Conservatives’ two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour once called “heinous”. This argument – that when faced with a revulsion election, caution and minimalism are the wisest course – has plenty to commend it. Voters are more frightened now than they were in 1996, on the eve of New Labour’s landslide win: the economy is doing worse, and they need more reassurance. The revulsion is more intense now than then, too: Johnson’s lies outstrip any John Major-era sleaze. And the electorate is more sceptical, even cynical, of big promises. Johnson said Brexit would bring wealth and sunshine, and it hasn’t; the Tories said they would level up, and they haven’t. Labour faces a nation that has lost faith in the notion that politics can change anything – and, if it wins power, it will not have at its disposal the cash that was around in the late 1990s. For all those reasons, to say nothing of Starmer’s own personality, it makes sense that, as one senior Labour figure puts it, the party offers “no Obama visions”. But the combination of revulsion and reassurance is not, on its own, sufficient for victory. As Uxbridge shows, one big local issue can be enough to stop the traffic from Tory to Labour. Voters are clearly being pushed away from the Conservatives, but they need to be pulled to Labour too. Not by grandiose, impossible dreams, but by a few costed, immediately understandable pledges that illustrate how life would be better under a Labour government.

Johnson on Monday met executives from major nuclear utilities and technology companies including the UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s EDF, and the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel to discuss ways of helping to speed up the development of new nuclear power stations. The UK generates about 16% of its power from nuclear power stations, but several reactors are slated for closure, while electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade. That would mean large investments in new power stations would be required just to keep the share of nuclear constant, let alone increase it to a record level of just over a quarter of electricity use. Also present at the meeting were a series of big pension companies and insurers, including Aviva, Legal &amp; General and Rothesay Life, alongside major foreign investors including Australia’s Macquarie and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Ministers have wrestled for years with how to attract private capital to invest in nuclear – but companies have balked at putting pension and insurance cash at risk. The government is considering changes to insurance rules set by the EU and copied by the UK to make it easier for insurers and pensions to invest. The UK is switching to a “regulated asset base” model, which it hopes will give long-term investors more certainty on returns, a change it hopes will address limitations to the current rules, known as Solvency II. The government wanted to show the nuclear and investment industries that it had a “clear ambition for more nuclear” in part to balance out intermittent renewable power sources, according to a government source briefed on the discussion. Scrutiny of the government’s energy policies has increased in recent months after unprecedented increases in fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the pressure, with oil and gas prices surging and western allies considering restricting energy exports as they try to isolate president Vladimir Putin’s regime. The prime minister last week met oil and gas executives to discuss increasing investments in the North Sea, and it is understood that he will next week meet executives from the offshore wind industry to discuss plans for further expansion of renewables. According to an aide who was present at the meeting, Johnson told industry heads and financiers that there had been a “chronic absence” of leadership by successive British governments on nuclear energy and that the country was “being left for dead” by other nations, such as France, on the issue. Speaking after the meeting, Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen our energy security as we move towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.” The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and geopolitical tensions making the government less keen on attracting Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast. Meanwhile the existing nuclear fleet has been in steady decline, with Hunterston B in Scotland retiring earlier this year, Hinkley Point B in Somerset due to follow suit in the summer, and Heysham I and Hartlepool I due to shut down in 2024. At that point, nuclear capacity is expected to fall as low as 3.6GW. A cross-party group of MPs that campaigns on nuclear issues has called for the government to increase its annual nuclear power capacity to 15GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2050, far above the 12.7GW installed at nuclear power’s peak in 1995. Major obstacles include difficulty in securing funding from private investors and a ban on new nuclear projects in Scotland, imposed by the devolved government, which prevents Hunterston B being replaced. The government is examining a plan to revise the financing model for major projects, which was among the factors that scuppered the Wylfa project in north Wales. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&amp;G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (Rab), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on Rab funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/02/pakistan-government-faces-backlash-over-draconian-arrest-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-02T17:32:46Z","webTitle":"Pakistan government faces backlash over ‘draconian’ arrest powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/02/pakistan-government-faces-backlash-over-draconian-arrest-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/02/pakistan-government-faces-backlash-over-draconian-arrest-powers","fields":{"bodyText":"The Pakistan government is facing a backlash from MPs and senators after introducing an amendment to a colonial-era secrets act that critics have said will grant “draconian” powers to its military intelligence agency to detain and arrest citizens with impunity. The amendment was quietly added in a parliamentary session and passed without providing copies to MPs, creating concern among parliamentarians on both sides of the aisle. It is now before a standing committee before it is presented to the Senate to formally become law or be rejected. The amendment empowers the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) agencies to “at any time, enter and search any person or place, without warrant, and if necessary, by use of force” for anyone suspected of breaching the Official Secrets Act, such as leaking the name of an agency official. It also defines an “enemy” broadly as “any person directly or indirectly intentionally or unintentionally working for or engaged with the foreign power, foreign agent, non-state actor, organisation [or] a group guilty of a particular act tending to show a purpose that is prejudicial to the safety and interest of Pakistan”. Activists, politicians and lawyers said the bill would further trample democracy and human rights in Pakistan. Salahuddin Ahmed, a lawyer, said: “It is a draconian law that will give impunity to Pakistan’s feared intelligence agencies and formalise and enhance their already oversized influence over all of Pakistan’s affairs.” The interior minister who had signed and introduced the amendment did not respond to a request for comment. Military and security agencies such as the ISI already enjoy extensive unchecked power in Pakistan, but up to now had no legal protection for the enforced disappearances, abductions, torture and lengthy detentions that they have long been accused of carrying out. Attempts to make enforced disappearances and abductions by military agencies illegal have previously been blocked by the powerful military establishment. Tahir Bezinjo, a senator, said the government was “setting a very dangerous precedent” with this amendment. “This gives a legal cover for security agencies such as ISI to raid, abduct, and detain people,” he said. “I am 100% sure the same law will be used against anyone, be it politicians, activists or lawyers, who confront the military and its power. It is indeed a black chapter in the history of Pakistan.” Senator Mushtaq Ahmed accused the government of trying to force the bill through the lower and upper houses of parliament without any discussion or deliberation. “The bill makes parliament redundant,” he said. “I see it as a strategic amendment which would have a lasting impact on human liberty and dignity, fundamental rights, democracy and free speech.” The bill is among several that have been presented in parliament this week by the ruling coalition, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, granting greater powers to the military and security establishment. Sharif’s government is due to hand over power to a caretaker government next week, which will govern until elections by November, which will be taking place against a backdrop of severe economic and political turbulence. The ruling government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) enjoys a close relationship with the military establishment that has opposed the media and groups promoting democracy and human rights. The military is overseeing a crackdown against the former prime minister Imran Khan, who was highly critical of its grasp over Pakistan’s politics and openly condemned the country’s powerful army chief, Gen Asim Munir. The military has attempted to dismantle Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party by arresting and pressurising many of his close aides, but Khan and his party remain a challenge in the elections. Ammar Ali Jan, a historian and political activist, said this law showed that Pakistan was moving backwards in terms of democracy and human rights. “The act institutionalises enforced disappearance and erodes any hope of things getting better,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T01:42:48Z","webTitle":"Most Australian states face sharp power bill rises, despite government’s intervention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/power-bills-in-three-australian-states-to-rise-by-almost-a-quarter-but-its-not-as-bad-as-it-could-have-been","fields":{"bodyText":"Power bills for households in three states will rise as much as 23.7% from 1 July if the Australian Energy Regulator’s draft determination, announced on Wednesday, is confirmed. Prices in Victoria may rise by almost a third. The AER chair, Clare Savage, said the increases were “significant” but they could have been as much as 40% to 50% without the federal government’s intervention in December to cap domestic gas and black coal prices. The electricity price safety net, also known as the default market offer, is intended to set maximum increases for households and small business customers on standard retail plans in South Australia, New South Wales and south-east Queensland. Victoria releases its own default offer. In NSW, residential customers face price increases of as much as 23.7%, or 16.9 percentage points higher than the inflation rate. Those in south-east Queensland face increases of as much as 19.8% and residents in South Australia as much as 21.8%, the AER said. For small business customers, prices will increase between 14.7% and 25.4% depending on their region, the regulator said. Victoria also released its own draft decision for consultation, proposing the average annual bill for domestic customers on the Victorian Default Offer will rise 31.1%, with small business customers facing increases of 33.2%. “The draft decision proposes an increase of around $426 for residential customers, with typical bills increasing from $1,403 to around $1,829 per year,” the state’s Essential Services Commission said. “For small business customers, typical bills would increase by around $1,738, from $5,620 to around $7,358 per year.” The AER said customers should shop around to minimise the increases. “Based on offers available in February 2023, residential customers switching from a standing offer to the lowest market offer could save 7% to 17% and small business customers could save 9% to 26%, depending on their region,” the regulator said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Savage told ABC’s Radio National: “It’s not as bad as it could have been.” The federal government legislated to cap wholesale gas prices temporarily at $12 a gigajoule and cap coal prices at $125 a tonne, a move Treasury estimated would save the average households $230 on their electricity bills in the next financial year. The AER said forward contract prices for the 2023-24 financial year had begun to fall in south-east Queensland and NSW “as soon as the intervention was publicly mooted”. “Contract prices have now fallen by approximately 50% since the end of October,” it said. “However, despite this significant decline, the trade-weighted average prices for 2023-24 contracts are around $40 per megawatt-hour higher than they were at the start of 2022 in all regions.” On Monday the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said he expected the default offer to be “significantly lower than the AER’s predictions” before the government’s intervention in December. In November the AER advised that, without action, the residential default offer would increase by between 35% and 44% in NSW, 51% in South Australia, and 41% in south-east Queensland. Bowen revealed that the government estimated small business customers were on track to pay 37% more in NSW, 53% more in South Australia and 50% more in south-east Queensland. “We simply had to act,” he told the Sydney Institute. “But I know that will be cold comfort for people who will still have to deal with the resulting energy bill increases.” On Wednesday, Bowen said households would avoid increases of $268 – $530 because of the intervention. The savings for small businesses would reach as much as $1,243. Bowen noted that the government would deliver $1.5bn of energy price relief rebates, expected after the May budget. The Coalition’s energy spokesman, Ted O’Brien, said the higher prices were evidence of a “broken promise reconfirmed”, with more than 82,000 households now on hardship programs. “Energy bills have skyrocketed despite Labor’s promise of a $275 reduction and now they are set to soar even higher,” O’Brien said. “It’s further proof that Labor’s energy plan is failing.” Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, called on Victoria’s Essential Services Commission to “think again” about its “problematic” recommended price increase. “They average contract prices over a 12-month period and so their calculation reflects the surge in contract prices from around June to October last year,” Mountain says. “But there is little evidence to suggest that these contract prices represent the costs that retailers will incur over the coming 12 month period,” he says. The result is that the increases - if maintained in the final decision - would “needlessly deliver large windfall profits particularly for Victoria’s large retailers, at customers’ expense”. “This is contrary to the government’s stated objective in introducing the VDO.” Data from Energy Action shows Victoria’s wholesale power prices jumped from the middle of last year but not as much as states to the north. The commission said wholesale power costs were up 95% from the 2022-23 year, and made up about 36% of the annual domestic bills. The Victorian government said households would still continue to pay less on average for their electricity than residents in south-east Queensland, NSW and South Australia. “We know that Victorian households are facing real pressures because of the increasing cost of energy globally,” said a spokesperson for the energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. “That’s why we’ve fast-tracked a new round of the $250 power saving bonus and encourage Victorians to access our rebates for solar PV and hot water systems. “We’re also reducing our reliance on costly fossil fuels – that’s why we’re bringing back the State Electricity Commission and replacing unreliable, privatised coal with clean, government-owned, renewable energy.” The Victorian opposition leader, John Pesutto, said the government should explain why the proposed increase was larger for Victorians than elsewhere. “Four years ago, [premier] Daniel Andrews promised Victorians that he would reduce power prices through a default market offer,” Pesutto said. “Well today, he’s broken his promise and he owes Victorians an explanation for why they are paying more for energy prices than people living in other states around our country. People are doing it hard. They need relief, not energy price increases when they can least afford it.” Cassandra Goldie, chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the latest increase would land as a blow for consumers after increases of 20% last year. “People on the lowest incomes do not have anything left in their budgets to cut back on and are at breaking point,” Goldie said. ACOSS wants the federal government to adjust the AER’s guidelines for the default offer to lower retail margins as has been done in Victoria. The chief executive of Energy Consumers Australia, Lynne Gallagher, said as many as half of households could be missing out on assistance that they are eligible for, often because of red tape. “Retailers know when customers are not on the best deal and we’d like them to be more proactive in reaching out to offer them the best possible option,” she said. After consultation, the AER will issue its final default offer for the year in May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-27T00:01:16Z","webTitle":"Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/27/russia-power-britain-democracy-vladimir-putin-yevgeny-prigozhin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-27T14:45:38Z","webTitle":"Russia’s power games are a wake-up call for Britain: our democracy is precious – and fragile | Rafael Behr","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/russia-power-britain-democracy-vladimir-putin-yevgeny-prigozhin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/27/russia-power-britain-democracy-vladimir-putin-yevgeny-prigozhin","fields":{"bodyText":"There is gratification but no comfort in seeing Vladimir Putin’s grip on power loosened. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the warlord whose aborted mutiny gave the world a glimpse of Putin’s political mortality, represents nothing better for Russia’s future. There is not much hope for democracy in a country where the most effective challenge to a tyrant’s rule comes from a murderous bandit who demands more competent tyranny. As for what happens next, there is not much point forecasting from abroad. I learned as a correspondent in Moscow that decrypting Russian power games is hard enough from inside the country. The boundary between rumour, misinformation, paranoid conspiracy theory and actual conspiracy is hard to discern. That’s why I came home. Nothing stirs appreciation of western liberal democracy like sustained exposure to its opposite. British politics has demeaned itself in recent years, but that judgment at least contains a memory of higher standards. Most laments about Westminster dysfunction express a portion of faith that something better is available without violence. There is much that is flawed about our constitutional arrangements, not least the assumption that good manners and elite education are protection against abuse of power. It turns out that a prime minister can have impeccable establishment credentials and also no capacity for shame, in which case embarrassment alone won’t stop him lying or appointing unsuitable cronies to the upper house of parliament. But there is resilience despite the rot. This month’s report by the privileges committee into Boris Johnson’s lies to the Commons was a reassertion of constitutional muscle by a legislature that was marginalised during the pandemic and belittled by Brexit. Partly that was a function of MPs’ collective failure to grip events. Mostly it flowed from populist construal of the referendum result as the irresistible “will of the people”, conferring on the prime minister (as the people’s champion) a veto over any dissent in the Commons. The lowest point was September 2019, when Johnson used crown prerogative powers to dissolve parliament because it wouldn’t do his bidding. The weird ceremonial pageantry of prorogation couldn’t camouflage the authoritarian impulse. But the system didn’t yield. The supreme court overturned the decision. It is demoralising that a man such as Johnson was able to become prime minister, but there is compensation in the brevity of his tenure. Which is the better measure of institutional function: exposure of the flaw or discovery that it isn’t fatal? The question is more pertinent in the US, where Donald Trump is a proven threat to the constitution, faces 37 felony charges and is somehow still a candidate for the White House in 2024. The Capitol insurrection of January 2021 should have buried Trump completely. That it hasn’t exposes a terrible atrophy in the sinews that hold the US’s civic culture together. Democracies can be enforced with rules, but they can’t thrive without adherence to unwritten cultural norms, of which perhaps the most essential is loser’s consent. The defeated side defers to the result of a fair election, and trusts that the winner will refrain from spiteful reprisals against a beaten rival. The basis of that bargain is recognition that electoral minorities still have some representation and retain a stake in continuity of the system as a whole. Parties can vehemently oppose each other on almost everything, while accepting a common interest in a democratic project that is bigger than any faction, movement or individual. It is grimly hard to see that ethos emerging in Russia and alarmingly easy to imagine it withering in the US. It is no small mercy that in Britain the likely losers of the next election can be relied on to accept their fate. Many Tory MPs have given up already. As polls currently stand, the contest doesn’t look close, but it will be competitive and the choice facing the country will be a meaningful one. The system is imperfect but not a sham. Whether the difference between the two candidates for prime minister is big enough is a point of contention. Pro-Europeans despair at the opposition’s acquiescence to a hard Brexit. Radicals of left and right see convergence on fiscal policy – consensus that budget discipline is a virtue – as tantamount to a merger of Labour and Tory frontbenches. It takes an effort of ideological obtuseness to survey the past 13 years of Conservative government and conclude that a Starmer administration would be no different, or that Rishi Sunak’s refusal to cut taxes makes him a Labour-lite prime minister. A craving for drastic measures is understandable given the scale of problems facing the country. There is a deathly undertow in the current economic stagnation that makes caution feel like surrender. The appeal to reform by increments can sound like acceptance of decline. Impatience with the slow grinding of centrist gears is especially pronounced in younger voters who didn’t collect fond memories, safe jobs or housing assets in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis. Millennials have experienced economic policy for most of their adult lives as a boomer protection racket. Perhaps it isn’t surprising that surveys find them less sentimentally attached to democracy than older generations. One poll in 2019 found a majority of under-40s agreeing that the country could benefit from “having a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections”. That was in the buildup to the general election with Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on the ballot – the most febrile, polarised moment in recent British politics. Some of the appetite for revolution has probably dissipated since then, but not the underlying disillusionment. Feeling uninspired by the electoral options should not be the default experience of democracy, but it is also to be expected from time to time. It doesn’t follow that the choice is illusory. “They are all the same” is a complaint too often made by people who haven’t experienced politics in countries where there really isn’t any point in voting. Putin’s bid for re-election, due next year, will showcase that kind of ballot, if he even allows one. The difference should be obvious. It is not an enormous achievement for Britain to have better politics than Russia, but it is still reason to be grateful. Or at least it is reason to see the strength in depth of a political culture that has retained, through multiple overlapping crises, the credible promise of peaceful regime change. To name any virtue in British democracy invites a charge of complacency because the reality is always short of the ideal, and every departure from the ideal can be plotted on a trajectory to authoritarianism. The only way is down and the slope is always slippery. It is right to be vigilant, but not to the exclusion of perspective, for which events in Moscow are instructive. British politics often feels degraded, but it has not been stripped of the fibres that bind us together in a common political enterprise. It is worth pausing to celebrate that from time to time – not because the system is in robust health, but because one of the forces that corrodes democracy is premature despair that it has already been lost.

Come 29 April, Channon will attend the closure of the AGL Energy coal-fired facility, joining hundreds of current and former staff, community members and even artists marking the end of what was Australia’s biggest power plant when it was built 52 years ago. “They’re not such good jobs when you’re covered in coal and ash and all the other sort of stuff out there,” he says. “Once it closes, it will definitely be something to think about, the family aspect of it.” Channon will be one of about 100 Liddell workers who will transfer to the nearby Bayswater power station, both bought by AGL for $1.5bn from the New South Wales government in 2014. The remaining 40-odd crew will retire or leave the industry. In 2015, AGL declared a 2022 closure target for Liddell, a power station dogged by frequent breakdowns including 23 restarts last year. It relented to pressure from the Turnbull government – which included lobbying AGL’s board to sell the plant to rival power generator, Alinta – to extend its life a year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup As part of its defence, AGL even ushered journalists through the dingy, dusty and noisy “old lady Liddell” in 2018. Kate Coates, the plant’s general manager at time, displayed a smörgåsbord of pulverised or shredded piping, telling visitors: “We can’t ask [her] to run a marathon a few days in a row without her falling over.” Initially generating 2,000MW at full tilt, it was downgraded to 1,680MW. With one of its four units shut last April, the plant has been typically generating at closer to 750MW lately, according to data group WattClarity. Excluding rooftop solar panels, NSW has almost 20,000MW of generation capacity prior to Liddell’s exit. The mammoth multi-year demolition operation to turn the site “cool, dark and dry”, as staffers say, has already begun. Liddell’s two towering smokestacks will be toppled and its eight-metre thick concrete base excavated and crushed on site. AGL expects more than 90% of the materials will be recycled, including 70,000 tonnes of steel, more than the metal used in the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Perhaps more difficult will be disposing of hundreds of thousands of litres of waste oil, acids and sludge and finding uses for a 200-hectare dam containing 39m tonnes of coal ash. Before then, though, the company will be working to ensure the plant continues to operate safely until its large turbine stops spinning on 28 April. Jarred Burns, who began his 23-year career at Liddell as an apprentice, expects a “mixture of emotions” when he turns up for that final shift. He’ll “be a bit relieved if it all goes out to plan … to make sure that it does do what it’s meant to do”. Veteran worker Graeme McNeill said ageing equipment was a major cause of an incident that left him “pretty badly burnt” several years ago. Hearing the tell-tale rumblings of a transformer overheating, he fled “as briskly as I could” but not before it exploded, spraying him with superheated oil. McNeill was flown by helicopter to Sydney’s Royal North Shore hospital, where he was treated for almost a fortnight. “It was very painful and a challenging recovery” he says, adding he enjoyed his job and was keen to return to work soon afterwards, confident that implemented changes would prevent a repeat of the incident. Rehabilitating the site itself won’t come cheap. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, said AGL has set aside $1.5bn for the clean-up of its four remaining large generators: Liddell and Bayswater in the Hunter Valley, Torrens Island near Adelaide and Loy Yang A in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley. According to AGL’s 2022 accounts, the twin Hunter plants face $687m rehab costs alone. One person knowledgable about the liabilities says the tab will probably exceed $1bn. “The assumption is that all of this has to go,” the person said. Brokhof says the ash dam may end up being the most costly part. According to the Hunter Community Environment Centre, Liddell’s coal ash totals 39m tonnes. Bayswater, presently slated to close by 2033 at the latest, adds another 45m tonnes. Heavy metals including selenium, lead and arsenic have all been detected in Lake Liddell, says Jo Lynch, the centre’s coordinator, during a recent walk along the shores of the lake. “The contamination is severe.” “There have been no plans stated for Lake Liddell,” Lynch says, with contaminants leaking in to the groundwater from the ash dump, and directly from the plant’s outfall. AGL’s interest in an ash reuse plant seems to have waned. “There’s not enough money for that,” she adds. Analysis by Environmental Justice Australia of data from the National Pollution Inventory shows Liddell power station recorded a 170% increase in mercury pollution from 16kg in 2021 to 40kg in 2022. Bayswater was the worst plant in the state, with mercury pollution reaching 112kg, Jem Wilson, an EJA spokesperson, said. “Mercury is a neurotoxin, which means it can damage the nervous system, brain and other organs of humans and animals,” Wilson said. It is also a persistent toxic element – which means that once it is present in water, it is there to stay. One hoped-for environmental benefit from Liddell’s closing will be the eventual reopening of Lake Liddell to swimming and waterskiing. AGL closed it “permanently” in 2016 after detecting the brain-eating amoeba Naegleria fowleri, possibly spawned by the unnaturally warm waters pumped out of the power station. The amoeba can cause infection in humans through the nasal sinuses. Potentially fatal cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis are associated with jumping or falling into water, actions that can force water into the nose under pressure, according to a fact sheet pinned to a wall at a lakeside changing rooms. The closure of a plant that was recently emitting 8m tonnes of greenhouse gases a year will also be a benefit, Lynch said. “From a climate perspective, we’re pleased to see the first closure happening.” Despite his incident, McNeill, who has also served as councillor for the local Muswellbrook shire for more than a decade, remains very fond of the power station. “[It] has been such a backbone for the area in terms of economics, and the state as a reliable supply of electricity”, he says. Employees – including McNeill’s son – are proud of the role they have played in “keeping the lights on” in NSW and beyond. “We all feel an obligation, in maintaining supply, working at Liddell,” he says. “Liddell has done this job. That’s its legacy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T15:00:08Z","webTitle":"Australian midwives should have power to prescribe medical abortions and contraception, inquiry hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/australian-midwives-should-have-power-to-prescribe-medical-abortions-and-contraception-inquiry-hears","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian midwives are calling for expanded roles, including prescribing medical abortions, as they warn of “abortion deserts” where women cannot access the healthcare they need. In an inquiry hearing on Friday, midwives are also set to call for broader rights to prescribe contraceptives. The Greens’ leader in the Senate and spokesperson on women, Larissa Waters, introduced the motion for a Senate committee inquiry into universal access to reproductive healthcare after the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade. Dr Zoe Bradfield, a senior research fellow at Curtin University and vice-president of the Australian College of Midwives, said midwives were “ready to go”. “Midwives are scoped to provide life-course care from menarche to menopause and everywhere in between,” she said. “All of the screening and diagnostics for pregnant people are often relevant for non-pregnant people. “We’re in the middle of a gender-based violence crisis … the screening midwives do for family and domestic violence, we’re already really good at that.” In its submission, the Australian College of Midwives (ACM) wrote that a broader presence in primary care could allow them to deliver to their “full scope”. The midwifery workforce is an “under-utilised resource that, if enabled, could play a crucial role in providing universal access to reproductive healthcare and women’s health underpinned by women’s choice and autonomous control”, the college wrote. “Endorsed midwives are already living and working in the identified ‘abortion deserts’ of Australia. “By undertaking the same credentialing and training required by medical practitioners (currently not available to midwives), these midwives will improve access and quality of care for women.” The college described abortion deserts as places “where women are unable to access the limited number of medical practitioners qualified to perform abortions and/or pharmacists to prescribe medical abortion”. That leads to limited access and long wait times, increasing the chances of poor outcomes, while midwives are “ideally placed to provide prescriptions for those seeking medical abortion”. The college also said the federal government should consider making the contraceptive pill, condoms and intrauterine devices free for those under 25 and allow midwives to prescribe contraceptives. Of 36,000 registered midwives, only 908 are endorsed (after extra study and 5,000 hours practice) to prescribe contraceptives and even then only a limited number are on the PBS. According to the submission, midwives would particularly help in rural, remote and Aboriginal communities. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Midwives Australia, which represents midwives in private practice, said midwives worked in a range of settings including homes, communities and health units and provided a range of services including sexual health and education. It said women’s access to “termination of pregnancy services across regional, rural and remote areas” is “highly problematic and below the expected standards for a first world nation”. In New Zealand, midwives play key roles not just in pregnancy, birth and post-birth, but also in medical abortions and the prescribing of contraception. “Unfortunately, in Australia the role and potential of the midwife is not fully realised,” MA wrote, adding they were not seen as “essential in public health strategy”. Midwives Australia called for a “whole of life approach”, for it to be easier for midwives to qualify to prescribe contraceptives and for legislative change so midwives could prescribe and provide medical terminations. The Nursing and Midwifery Federation also called for the removal of barriers for both nurses and midwives, as well as support for measures including providing contraceptive implants, hormone replacement therapy, termination counselling, and STI testing. MS Health, a non-profit pharmaceutical body that is part of MSI Australia, has applied to the Therapeutic Goods Administration to expand the number of eligible prescribers and therefore expand access. MS Health would like to see nurses, midwives, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healthcare workers able to prescribe medical abortions. The assistant health minister, Ged Kearney, said everyone deserved access to “equitable and appropriate sexual and reproductive healthcare”. “We know there are barriers to access for women seeking terminations or contraceptive options across Australia – be that geography, cost, lack of awareness for consumers or a lack of training or education among health practitioners,” she said. The committee is due to report on 11 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T07:00:15Z","webTitle":"Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra review: ultra camera, ultra power, ultra price","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/28/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review","fields":{"bodyText":"The Galaxy S23 Ultra is Samsung’s latest and greatest power-house smartphone with a more impressive chip, battery and camera than its predecessors. But do the improvements justify such a steep price? At £1,249 ($1,199/A$1,949), which is £100 more than last year’s model, it is one of the most expensive non-folding smartphones available. The S23 Ultra is the spitting image of its predecessor, an extremely solid and premium-feeling device and looks really good in cream, as pictured. It has the same super-bright and crisp screen, same aluminium frame and slightly less curved glass at the edges. One of the S23 Ultra’s unrivalled features is the fan-favourite S Pen stylus, which was added to the S series last year and receives only minor changes. It is a similar story for the software, with the phone running Samsung’s One UI 5.1, which is based on Android 13. It is packed with useful features, including productivity tools for the S Pen, and more customisation options for the lockscreen. The new phone will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches. Samsung has dramatically improved the speed and availability of updates for older devices over the past couple of years, which means most of its top line of phones made in the past few years are already running One UI 5.1. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 now worldwide Unusually for Samsung, all Galaxy S23 models use the same top Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip from Qualcomm regardless of where they are sold. In the past, most regions, including the UK and Europe, used Samsung’s own slightly weaker chips, while the US used Qualcomm’s. The new chip is therefore a bigger deal to consumers in Europe, not only boosting general and gaming performance by up to 35% but running much more efficiently, staying cooler under heavy workloads and extending battery life considerably. The S23 Ultra lasts more than 52 hours between charges, making it one of the longest-lasting smartphones I’ve tested alongside Apple’s iPhone 14 Plus. That was with the screen actively used for more than six hours and at least an hour spent on 5G a day, the rest of the time on wifi. Heavy gaming sessions reduced the battery life, but the phone survived even the heaviest days of general usage with about 30% left in the tank. I have no doubt almost three-day battery life is possible with more frugal use. Turning off the always-on display adds roughly 10% to the battery life. Specifications Main screen: 6.8in QHD+ Dynamic Amoled 2X (500ppi) 120Hz Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 RAM: 8 or 12GB Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: One UI 5.1 based on Android 13 Camera: Quad rear: 200MP, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP 3x and 10x telephoto; 12MP front-facing Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, UWB and GNSS Water resistance: IP68 (1.5m for 30 mins) Dimensions: 163.4 x 78.1 x 8.9mm Weight: 233g Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is generally repairable. Screen repairs cost about £260, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Samsung offers a self-repair programme in the US, but not in the EU or UK. The phone scores up to 6 out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability ranking. It contains recycled material in 12 components – double last year’s number – including aluminium, glass and plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Camera There are four cameras on the back of the phone and a good 12-megapixel selfie camera at the top of the screen. As with the previous two Ultra generations, the four-camera array includes 3x and 10x optical zoom telephoto 10MP modules, which are excellent and allow a far greater range of zoom than any rival. Images up to 30x zoom look as good as most other phones manage at less than 10x. The 12MP ultrawide produces excellent landscape and architecture shots and is used for Samsung’s very good macrophotography mode when up close. New for this year is a 200MP main camera, which uses the first of a new generation of sensors with just under double the pixel count of previous models. By default it uses the data from all the pixels to increase captured light and detail, producing 12MP images that are some of the very best available across a range of light levels. The phone can also shoot at 50MP or the full 200MP, the latter producing huge image files with an amazing amount of detail in bright light. They lack the dynamic range of 12MP shots, however, as they lose some of the advanced processing. Low-light mode is slightly better overall and produces generally well exposed images, though is needed less as the camera gathers more light to start with. The camera app is packed with advanced and fun features, including a full RAW shooting experience for those looking to do their own editing and the most capable video on Android. Samsung’s portrait photography, particularly at its 3x zoom, is class-leading on natural look and fine details such as flyaway hairs. Compared with the S21 and S22 Ultra from the last two years, the S23 Ultra offers only incremental upgrades across the entire camera system. But that has kept it the most capable camera on any smartphone available, and is about the only one I would consider to be able to replace the utility of a dSLR or equivalent with its full range of optical zoom. Price The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra costs from £1,249 ($1,199.99/A$1,949) with 256GB of storage. For comparison, the Galaxy S23 costs £849, the S23+ costs £1,049, the Z Fold 4 costs £1,649, the Google Pixel 7 Pro costs £749 and the iPhone 14 Pro costs £1,099. Verdict If ever there was a phone worthy of the “ultra” moniker, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is it. The phone is unrivalled in size, power, capability and battery life on Android, while its camera is more capable than any other on the market. It is very much overkill for most, but for those who would like the ability to do more or less anything with a phone, the S23 Ultra has the goods. It is full of little improvements to almost every aspect. However, it only builds on big leaps made two years ago and is overshadowed by more innovative folding devices. Its very high price makes it poor value next to the Google Pixel 7 Pro, which cannot match the Samsung on every element but comes close enough for £400-£500 less. It is without doubt the best Android phone available. Whether that’s enough to be a hit at this price any more, I’m not sure. Pros: very big 120Hz screen, brilliantly capable camera with 3x and 10x optical zoom, good software with five years support, faster fingerprint scanner, S Pen stylus, top performance, very long battery life, contains recycled materials. Cons: huge, heavy, extremely expensive, S Pen may be superfluous feature for many."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/17/afternoon-update-border-force-raids-sydney-home-hillsong-founder-acquitted-and-the-game-that-stopped-a-nation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T06:55:11Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Border force raids Sydney home; Hillsong founder acquitted; and the game that stopped a nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/17/afternoon-update-border-force-raids-sydney-home-hillsong-founder-acquitted-and-the-game-that-stopped-a-nation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/17/afternoon-update-border-force-raids-sydney-home-hillsong-founder-acquitted-and-the-game-that-stopped-a-nation","fields":{"bodyText":"Good afternoon.

The ground lost to Borussia Dortmund between 2010 and 2012 was spectacularly recaptured, along with many of the rival club’s best players. The abortive reign of Carlo Ancelotti in 2016 seems to have warned the club hierarchy off the allure of the star foreign manager. And the remarkable chain of events that has reconfigured the landscape of German football over the past fortnight may just have its origins in Bayern’s failed pursuit of a promising young coach called Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel had been on Bayern’s radar as early as 2014, when Pep Guardiola began to recommend the Mainz coach as a potential successor. Cordial meetings were held with the sporting director, Michael Reschke, and the club president, Uli Hoeness. But it was in 2018, when the veteran coach Jupp Heynckes announced his retirement, that the chase really began. Heynckes publicly anointed Tuchel as his chosen successor and talks were arranged. But Bayern were too late. Tuchel had made up his mind to go abroad, and would soon be unveiled as the manager of Paris Saint-Germain. If Julian Nagelsmann was unnerved at the prospect of Tuchel returning to the job market, he did a good job of hiding it. As his Bayern squad broke up for the international break after the 2-1 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, there was little portent of the approaching chaos. “Everyone come back healthy from the internationals,” Nagelsmann warned his team in what would be their final meeting together. “And then we’ll smash Dortmund!” At which point Nagelsmann went skiing in the Austrian Alps with his girlfriend. He would only find out late on the Thursday night via media reports that his job had been given to Tuchel. It seemed logical enough, even if the shock value at the time was real. Beat Dortmund at the Allianz Arena this Saturday – as they have done in each of their last eight meetings at home – and Bayern will return to the top of the Bundesliga, presumptive favourites to win their 11th title in a row. This season’s Champions League has produced eight wins out of eight. But then raw numbers have never kept any Bayern manager safe. This is a club where coaches are hired and fired largely on feel and projection, the vague but compelling idea that some basic essence has been lost. “This is not what Bayern stands for,” the current sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, said scornfully after the defeat to Leverkusen, and in retrospect this was the point at which we should have realised that change was coming. And something has undoubtedly been slightly off at Bayern this season, even if it is hard to pin down exactly what. There were few signs of dressing-room disaffection, and indeed over the international window many Bayern players expressed their surprise at Nagelsmann’s sacking. Certainly results since the World Cup have been substandard, allowing a surging Dortmund to go top for the first time in almost four years. Eleven points dropped from winning positions hints at a certain brittleness and an occasional tendency to concede soft goals. But there is nothing like a smoking gun here. Indeed, the timing of Nagelsmann’s sacking seems to be intrinsically linked to Tuchel’s availability, and the fear of losing out on him again with Tottenham and Real Madrid circling. All of which, coming days before a crucial title showdown against Dortmund and a Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City, raises certain pressing questions. Has the ultimate long-term process club just had a massive short-term spasm? Has the club that like to plot out their managerial changes years in advance succumbed to the sugar-fix of the new-manager bounce? “It’s not the time for big changes in systems or tactics,” Tuchel said at his Bayern unveiling, and the urgency of the tests ahead suggests that pragmatism will define his early weeks in the job. The short-term priority will be to strengthen a defence that has kept just two clean sheets in its past 10 games, which suggests the three-man defence he employed at Chelsea may well be repeated on Saturday. There are intentional parallels here with his spell at Stamford Bridge, during which he won the Champions League within his first six months of taking the job. That run was also based on a remarkable defensive record, with two central midfielders screening the back three and allowing the wing-backs to press high up the pitch. The obvious point to make here, and one borne out by Tuchel’s body of work at Mainz, Dortmund and Paris, is that clearly he is better than a stop-gap coach. But how much better? Man for man, Bayern’s squad bears comparison with any in Europe, from João Cancelo and Matthijs de Ligt in defence, to Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka in midfield, to the array of riches in the final third. A new goalkeeper and a No 9 are probably needed soon, but this is not a team in desperate need of a rebuild. In short: if ever there were an opportunity for Tuchel to put down roots, to articulate a long-term vision, to prove his staying power, this is it. For all the haste of his arrival, he finds himself in the extremely rare position of having time on his side. Even a failure to win the Bundesliga or Champions League this season will probably not be held against him. Barring abject disaster, he should get at least a year to build the team he wants. There may be a certain irony in this, but a short-term punt on a short-term coach may just have given Bayern their best shot in a while at long-term stability."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/sep/05/ukraine-war-turns-the-tables-as-russia-seeks-help-from-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-05T06:02:24Z","webTitle":"Ukraine war turns the tables as Russia seeks help from North Korea","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/ukraine-war-turns-the-tables-as-russia-seeks-help-from-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/sep/05/ukraine-war-turns-the-tables-as-russia-seeks-help-from-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"After years of backing UN sanctions targeting North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, Russia is now reaching out to its neighbour for help. The war in Ukraine has forced the Kremlin to reassess its relationship with Pyongyang as it seeks to secure weapons to replace its own depleted stocks. A possible meeting between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un later this month in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok would add geopolitical substance to the symbolic meeting of minds that has unfolded between the leaders of the pariah states over 18 months of fighting in Ukraine. With Russia quickly using up its munitions, Putin is expected to build on recent high-level diplomatic exchanges, including a visit to the North by his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to secure North Korean artillery shells and antitank missiles. In return, North Korea is hoping to receive valuable foreign currency to continue funding its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles – its trump card in its quest to secure concessions, and recognition as a legitimate nuclear state, from the US. Closer ties between Moscow and Pyongyang extend beyond bartering for bullets, however. Russia’s growing isolation has sent it in a new, worrying direction as it seeks to build a united front against a “hostile” west that includes China and now, it seems, North Korea and its million-strong army. As news emerged of Kim’s possible trip to Vladivostok, media reported that the North could take part in joint naval drills with Russia and China. “Why not, these are our neighbours,” Shoigu said this week when asked about the exercises, according to Russia’s Interfax news agency. “There’s an old Russian saying: you don’t choose your neighbours and it’s better to live with your neighbours in peace and harmony.” Russia’s decision to turn to North Korea for weaponry is a sign of rapidly shifting dynamics in the countries’ relations since Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded the North in 1948 with the backing of the Soviet Union. North Korea later received support from Beijing and Moscow during the 1950-53 Korean war, and was heavily reliant on Soviet aid for decades. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s contributed to a deadly famine in the North in which as many as three million people died. In the years after Kim Jong-un came to power following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, both Moscow and Beijing supported UN sanctions designed to force the North Korean leader into abandoning his ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. It was only after the North conducted its last nuclear test, in 2017, that Kim set about mending ties, meeting Putin for the first time in 2019, as hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough on nuclear weapons turned to resignation after Kim and Donald Trump failed to settle their differences over sanctions relief. In a message to Putin to mark Russia’s national day in June this year, Kim pledged his regime’s “full support” for the invasion of Ukraine, and vowed to “hold hands” with the Russian leader in their common aim to build “a powerful country”. The North is also one of only two UN member states, in addition to Russia, to have recognised the independence of Russian-claimed Ukrainian regions. “Moscow’s ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine has ushered in a new geopolitical reality in which the Kremlin and (North Korea) may become increasingly close, perhaps even to the point of resurrecting the quasi-alliance relationship that had existed during the cold war,” Artyom Lukin, a professor at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, wrote in a report for 38 North. If the meeting takes place, Putin could find himself confronted by a tough negotiator, according to John Everard, Britain’s ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2008. Pyongyang knows that Moscow is desperate for munitions, Everard told the BBC, adding that he expected North Korea to demand an “eye-wateringly high” price. The last time Kim’s armoured train rolled into Vladivostok four years ago, he was welcomed with a traditional offering of salt and bread. But Putin’s troubled war in Ukraine means that on his next visit, Kim will be the one bearing gifts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-02T23:01:53Z","webTitle":"Luxury and Power review: boozed-up Persians and Greeks on a 500-year bender","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/03/luxury-and-power-review-bender-persians-greeks-british-museum","fields":{"bodyText":"A pair of sculpted heads stare at each other at the start of this exhibition: an ancient Persian with a square beard and tight ringlets facing up to the Greek god Apollo. Here is a polarity that has defined global history. The struggle between the Greek city states and the Achaemenid empire was believed by the Greeks to be a fight to establish who they were: western, not eastern, self-governing, and democratic in the case of Athens, as opposed to the playthings of Persian tyrants. But guess what – the reality was more complicated. The Persian portrait and the Chatsworth Apollo, as it’s known, are not so different. Both come from 5th century BC Cyprus, and are associated with sanctuaries where Apollo and the Persian god Reshef were jointly worshipped. One thing this exhibition in the BM’s compact Great Court gallery has going for it is clarity. It covers 500 years of Persian and Greek history but instead of an epic, exhausting saga it is more like a brief introduction centred on the theme of luxury. That is a key word in classical historical and political texts, the flaw that corrupts and destroys societies, associated with the east and Persian power. To suggest it, the gallery has been swathed with white draperies and faux columns like a tackily overdone Greek restaurant, or maybe a shop selling repro antiques. There are three sections: a sort of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. First, we get a taste of the Persian empire, including a relief of Darius I worshipping Anubis in Egyptian style. Then we see how classical Athens wrestled with Persian artistic influence even as it mocked the defeated empire. Finally, the two cultures merge as Alexander the Great conquers Persia yet embraces its ways. The wars that ancient historians made so much of are relegated to small connecting displays – a Hoplite helmet, sounds of clashing weapons, that’s your lot. It’s more surprising that such short shrift is given to “the Greek historian Herodotos”. It’s oddly pedantic to insist on the Greek version of his name when he’s been famous for centuries as Herodotus. And strange to marginalise the father of history: Herodotus didn’t just tell of Persia’s invasion of Greece and its failure, but also explored the cultures of much of the Greeks’ known world, perhaps even visiting Babylon to research and listen. Herodotus brings history to life, which this show refuses to do. Rejecting all that Herodotean stuff, it instead centres on a history of cups. At the heart of each section are huge, luxurious drinking cups known as rhytons. Shaped like horns, made of gold or silver, these Persian banqueting vessels feature bulls, griffins and human portraits. They must have been fantastic to drink from. But they are not very moving to look at. In classical Athens, full of cocky democratic self-consciousness after seeing off the mighty Achaemenid army, it was considered vulgar and ostentatious to drink from a bulbous golden horn. So rhytons were made out of clay. A display of drinking cups from 5th century Athens shows how ceramicists and painters turned the opulent Persian rhyton into pottery in the shape of ram and pig heads, painted red, white and black. Surely this all confirms the traditional view that Greek and Persian culture were opposites. Athens in the 5th century BC was so rich it could afford a gigantic ivory statue of Athena, covered in gold, to stand inside the new Parthenon temple, rebuilt after the Persians had sacked the Acropolis. Yet the classical style that crystallised at this time was simple and austere, rejecting Persian magnificence. A section of the Parthenon frieze in the exhibition depicts young Athenian women carrying Persian objects as tribute in the Panathenaic procession: but artistically this masterpiece owes nothing to Persia. The show can’t actually demonstrate anything like as much Persian influence as it wants to. Persians instead appear as the foils of Athenian self-confidence: one drinking cup is shaped into a caricature of a grimacing, defeated “Persian”. Things flare into life when Alexander the Great comes on stage, though. Born in Macedon in 356 BC, Alexander defeated Persia, burned its great capital Persepolis, and created a new Greek empire from Egypt to Afghanistan. Now cultures really did mingle. An Egyptian statue from the 4th century BC looks completely Pharaonic but it’s a portrait of one of the Greek rulers from whom Cleopatra descended. This Hellenistic era comes across as a fascinating, seductive cultural melting pot. At the heart of the Hellenistic delights are gold drinking cups and platters from the Panagyurishte Treasure, exquisite Thracian objects lent by Bulgaria’s National Museum of History. They brilliantly combine Greek and Persian themes in an aesthetic free-for-all. A drinking horn has a classical frieze, naked gods and demigods sport on cups with bull faces, all in glinting gold. A cup in the shape of a Greek amphora has two centaurs dancing on it as handles. This is drunk history in which stiff classicism melts into “oriental” splendour. At last, we get a draught of intoxicating exuberance.

Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. Federal prime minister Alexander De Croo said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. The ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said “Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable.” Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian Embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports. Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/25/pacific-islands-guam-china-aid-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-25T14:00:11Z","webTitle":"Pacific islands warn US over Chinese threat and urge Biden to increase aid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/25/pacific-islands-guam-china-aid-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/25/pacific-islands-guam-china-aid-biden","fields":{"bodyText":"Countering China and bolstering national security dominated the conversation in a Hilton hotel on Guam, 15 hours before and oceans away from the Milwaukee arena hosting the first Republican primary debate. Nine members of the GOP-led House committee on natural resources convened in the US-governed Pacific island territory for a rare field hearing – during the summer recess – on countering China’s influence in the region. At a time when Democrats and Republicans view China as an economic and global security threat, island nations who offer the US military proximity to China in exchange for aid emphasized they are especially vulnerable to Chinese cyber-attacks and economic exploitation as they struggle to recover from the pandemic. “Less than 2,000 miles away lies a threat to America and our allies. The People’s Republic of China under the tyranny of the Chinese Communist party not only seeks to challenge American leadership but is aggressively working to undermine the Democratic values and institutions we cherish,” said the Republican chairman, Bruce Westerman, of Arkansas, in his opening remarks. Westerman pointed to a security breach in May, in which US officials and Microsoft found that a Chinese government-sponsored hacking group had targeted critical US infrastructure on Guam, as an example of CCP aggression in the region. Westerman said there was “a distinct difference between the PRC’s leadership and the many Chinese citizens who long for that same freedom that we as Americans enjoy”. The Biden administration has moved to expand its diplomatic presence in the Pacific islands as part of its national security strategy against China. Last spring, the Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China, raising alarm bells that the CCP was seeking to establish a permanent military presence in the region. Last fall, Joe Biden hosted a first-ever summit of Pacific islands leaders in Washington, and he is set to host another this September. At the Thursday hearing, Pacific island officials testified that while they welcome deepened ties with the US, China could exploit any gaps in that relationship. “The CCP moves aggressively to fill perceived voids in America’s assistance and to capitalize on social and economic vulnerabilities of the Pacific island communities,” said Kaleb Udui Jr, the finance minister of Palau, citing land grabs, expanding fisheries and other forms of political interference. He also said there was “clear influence” on government officials as China has offered trips to Beijing and hosted in-country events, “where we later found out the connections to organized crime or the CCP”. “If the US does not engage actively, China will,” said Lou Leon Guerrero, the Democratic governor of Guam. All three non-voting congressional delegates of the US’s Pacific island territories – Democrat Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan of the Northern Mariana Islands and Republicans Jim Moylan of Guam, and Amata Coleman Radewagen of American Samoa – are members of the natural resources committee and attended the field hearing. Westerman specifically thanked Moylan, a freshman delegate, for inviting the panel to visit Guam. Earlier this year, the Biden administration finalized negotiations with three island nations – the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Freely Associated States of Micronesia – to renew power-sharing agreements known as the Compacts of Free Association (Cofa), which give the US military access to strategic areas in the Pacific Ocean in exchange for economic aid. The US appointed a special envoy for the compact negotiations, Joseph Yun, who secured renewed deals with all three island nations after a holdout from the Marshall Islands. “The sad fact is that the US has fallen far short of treating us equally, fairly and consistently with the compact,” testified Jack Ading, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, who earlier called for more US compensation for nuclear testing after the second world war. “Unresolved problems from the nuclear tests and radioactive waste is a serious irritant in our relations, and has the potential for being exploited by China,” said Ading, who claimed that the effects from US nuclear detonation on the Marshall Islands was equal to “1.7 Hiroshima bombs every day for 12 years.” Ading said the compact agreement would not solve the nuclear issue but would be an important step toward doing so. While much of the panel’s questions focused on countering China’s influence, non-voting delegates and island officials also sought to raise issues of labor and housing shortages in their communities, as well as ask for additional resources to support education, build hospitals and protect the environment. Island leaders also emphasized the need for more US engagement to effectively counter the power of Chinese investment. “How do we address that? I think the federal agencies need to become more involved, not just in regulations, but become more involved in the development,” said Arnold Palacios, the governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, an independent."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/apr/03/doctor-who-star-ncuti-gatwa-tops-radio-times-uk-tv-power-list","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T23:01:33Z","webTitle":"Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa tops Radio Times UK TV power list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/apr/03/doctor-who-star-ncuti-gatwa-tops-radio-times-uk-tv-power-list","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/apr/03/doctor-who-star-ncuti-gatwa-tops-radio-times-uk-tv-power-list","fields":{"bodyText":"Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa has been named the most powerful person on British television, beating broadcaster Huw Edwards to the top spot. The 30-year-old actor topped the RadioTimes.com TV 100 power list, after rising to prominence for his role as Eric in the Netflix series Sex Education and being set to debut as the Doctor at the end of this year. Gatwa, who said the accolade was “bloody lovely”, beat the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who were ranked 15th, and Edwards, who placed as a runner-up after announcing the death of the Queen last year. Making up the top five are Heartstopper writer Alice Oseman in second place, White Lotus actor Jennifer Coolidge in fourth, and House of the Dragon breakout star Emma D’Arcy in fifth. Gatwa said: “Being recognised for anything is just bloody lovely, innit? Let alone being on the RadioTimes.com TV 100 list. TV is on fire at the moment, and so to top the list as well feels extra cool. “The titans that have topped the list before me, people such as Russell T Davies, Michaela Coel, Jodie Whittaker, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Olivia Colman, are all inspirations to me, and their work is something I aspire to. “They’re just really great storytellers above all else, and that’s all I could want to do.” Doctor Who screenwriter Davies, who topped the TV power list last year, said of Gatwa’s win: “Sometimes you know you’ve got a secret. And you hold it close to your chest and let it burn, because secrets are so delicious. “I’ve got that right now, because my secret is seeing Ncuti with Millie Gibson on the rushes of Doctor Who, every single day, and oh my God, this is so good. “I can promise you a completely new Doctor, and yet a Doctor utterly faithful to the 60 years that came before. Soon, the secret will be out, and we’ll all be dancing.” The annual Radio Times TV 100 power list celebrates the standout talents on screen and behind the scenes responsible for landmark moments in 2022. It is compiled by leading figures from across the creative industries, including the BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, who praised Gatwa’s “incredible dynamism” and boundless energy. Gatwa also beat The Traitors and Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman, and This Is Going to Hurt writer Adam Kay. England’s Lionesses appeared in eighth place on the list after their Euro 2022 final victory against Germany, which was “one of the most-watched TV spectacles of the year”, Radio Times said. Wildlife cameraman and CBeebies presenter Hamza Yassin, who won Strictly Come Dancing 2022, also made the list, alongside Heartstopper cast members Yasmin Finney, Kit Connor and Joe Locke. Morgan Jeffery, executive editor of RadioTimes.com, said: “I’m immensely proud of 2023’s list, which celebrates the brilliant diversity and vitality of television in all its forms and is led by a thoroughly deserving winner who is one of the industry’s very best and brightest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/02/most-voters-back-labor-bid-boost-wages-concerns-big-business-has-too-much-power-essential-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T15:00:05Z","webTitle":"Most voters back Labor bid to boost wages amid concerns big business has too much power, Essential poll finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/02/most-voters-back-labor-bid-boost-wages-concerns-big-business-has-too-much-power-essential-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/02/most-voters-back-labor-bid-boost-wages-concerns-big-business-has-too-much-power-essential-poll","fields":{"bodyText":"Twice as many voters in marginal seats think big business has too much power compared with unions, with most supporting Labor initiatives to boost workers’ pay. Those are the key findings of a new Essential poll of 1,207 people conducted for the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which unions have seized on to warn employer campaigns against changes to lift wages will fall flat. The poll was released on Wednesday ahead of a speech by the Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, arguing that industrial relations reforms proposed by the Albanese government are “anti-productivity”. Employers have been lobbying against changes including Labor’s proposal to require that labour hire employees receive the same pay as workers doing the same job who are directly employed in the same company. The Essential poll of voters in 12 marginal seats in Queensland and Western Australia found majority support for a range of measures to boost pay. Most respondents said the following were “something that would make a difference to workers and the government should do”: Change workplace laws to better protect workers from wage theft (70%). Increase the minimum wage (65%). Change workplace laws to close labour hire loopholes that allow employers to keep wages low through outsourcing (56%). However, support was lower for regulating the gig economy (51%) and changing workplace laws to “enable unions to negotiate higher wages” (47%). Some 30% of respondents said unions had “too much power”, while 38% said they had “about the right amount”, 19% “not enough power” and 13% were unsure. But respondents were much more wary of big business, with 59% saying they had “too much power”, 27% “about the right amount”, 6% not enough and 8% unsure. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Asked if people “working in the same role, doing the same job as a co-worker … should expect to be paid the same wage, regardless of if you are a full-time employee or a labour hire worker”, 26% agreed strongly, with a further 29% agreeing. Just 14% somewhat disagreed and 8% strongly disagreed with the statement, which is a core component of Labor’s loopholes bill to be introduced in the second half of the year. About a quarter (24%) neither agreed nor disagreed. The ACTU president, Michele O’Neil, said: “This research shows that the big money spent by the business lobby across TV, radio and print trying to discredit government plans to improve workers’ job security and wages is failing and a waste. “Australians do not trust big business, and will not accept being harangued by the business lobby about what is good for the nation.” In his speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Willox argues that “workplace laws need to be based on facts and research, not on political slogans and union claims”. “All we hear as a rationale are slogans – ‘Get wages moving’, ‘Same job, same pay’, ‘Close the loopholes’. We all deserve better,” he says in advance excerpts of the speech seen by Guardian Australia. Willox argues “the recent erosion of real wage rates driven by inflation is not due, as some would argue, to the systematic failure of our labour arrangements”. “Wage rates have recently lagged the sudden and unexpected price increases because of the inherent inertia in annual wage setting and multiyear agreements. “We all hope the recent signs of abating inflation are real but sadly it needs to be reiterated that driving wages up with no productivity trade-offs will only increase all our pain.” Willox called on the government to address the “sustained drop in productivity growth” to fix the “associated slowdown in the growth of real wages”. “Spending time talking about what is at its heart a misguided workplace agenda … driven by outdated union fixations … threatens to make achieving the vital productivity growth we need even harder. “We fear that much of what is on the table is actually anti-productivity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/08/can-new-spain-leftwing-party-sumar-win-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-08T14:00:17Z","webTitle":"Free money to teenagers, shorter working week and climate action: can Spain’s new leftwing party win power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/08/can-new-spain-leftwing-party-sumar-win-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/08/can-new-spain-leftwing-party-sumar-win-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Almost exactly a year ago, Yolanda Díaz gave a newspaper interview that appeared under the pleasingly provocative headline: “No basta con gestionar, a este Gobierno le falta alma” – “Running things isn’t enough; this government lacks spirit.” While alma could also be translated as soul, heart or enthusiasm, the thrust of her comments to El País was perfectly clear. Despite being a key figure in Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist-led minority administration – she serves as labour minister and second deputy prime minister – Díaz believes governing is about more than just delivery. For her, politicians are there to improve people’s lives, to defend and increase hard-won rights, and to leave their country in a better state than they found it. Still, as she told the paper, the odd “happy policy” never does any harm either. Twelve months on, as Spain faces a snap general election that could result in a coalition between the conservative People’s party (PP) and far-right Vox party, Díaz is putting her policies and her alma to the test. The new Sumar movement she leads – a platform of leftwing, far-left and green parties including the beleaguered Podemos, once the great new hope of the Spanish left – is hoping that it and the Socialists will pick up enough votes between them to keep the PP and Vox out of power. Like Sánchez, who has sought to portray the election as a Manichean choice between all that is progressive and all that is reactionary, Díaz is blunt about what’s at stake. “On 23 July, Spain will decide between two kinds of government – two coalitions,” she said on Wednesday. “The coalition of rights, freedom and progress – a coalition of us and the Socialist party – and the coalition of hatred, which rejects the rights of women and LGBT people, and which pits businesses against workers.” However, recent polls suggest that the “coalition of rights, freedom and progress” has a staggering amount of work to do over the next two weeks. The PP, led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo, remains firm favourite, even if it looks unlikely to secure an absolute majority and so will need to enlist the support of Santiago Abascal’s Vox – as it has in several cities and regions after May’s regional and local elections. With 350 seats in Spain’s congress, the rival coalitions will be aiming to get as close to the 176-seat threshold that constitutes a majority. A survey released by YouGov on Friday gave the PP 131 seats, the socialists 108, Vox 45 and Sumar 36, suggesting a possible absolute majority for a PP-Vox coalition. If the Sánchez camp is quietly confident that the PP’s lead is narrowing because its deals with Vox are putting off moderate voters, Díaz feels her own track record in government and her platform’s range of eyecatching policies will tempt disillusioned voters further to the left. The Sumar leader, a labour lawyer turned politician who was born in the north-western region of Galicia 52 years ago – and an atheist who describes her meeting with Pope Francis two years ago as “one of the most important conversations of my life” – enjoys the highest approval ratings of any Spanish political leader. Despite being a member of the Spanish Communist party and an avowed feminist, environmentalist and progressive, Díaz claims not to be a fan of pigeonholing – especially as she tries to appeal to the widest possible range of left-of-centre voters. “When it comes to -isms, I hate putting labels on things,” she said last week. “You’ll never find me in all that. What I am is a progressive woman who is the daughter of an anti-Franco activist who was a member of the Spanish Communist party.” Her task is not easy. Although Spain’s economy is in decent shape – the inflation rate fell to 1.9% in June – the cost of living crisis continues to bite and political disenchantment, especially on the left, is rife. Díaz acknowledges that what she terms “social malaise” or “citizen disaffection” is a big problem – worse than a few years ago, when anger and frustration over austerity and against elites gave rise to the indignados movement that created Podemos. She says that while people are struggling to make ends meet, and health workers and teachers are still exhausted in the wake of the Covid pandemic, the right and far-right are intent on making noise, waging culture wars and raising tensions rather than explaining what solutions their coalition government would offer. But Díaz insists Sumar, which she describes as “a citizens’ movement stitched together from the bottom up”, offers practical answers. It has pledged to put the climate emergency at the centre of policymaking, to introduce a shorter working week and, perhaps most arrestingly, to create a “universal inheritance” intended to improve social mobility by giving all young Spaniards €20,000 (£17,000) to spend on studying, training or starting a business when they reach the age of 18. Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University, says policies such as the universal inheritance are intended to snag the attention of leftwing voters and drag the focus away from the monolithic showdown between the Socialists and the PP. He says Sumar faces a number of challenges as it tries to court voters – especially among Podemos supporters, who are still reeling from the party’s disastrous showing in the local and regional elections, and angry about what they see as Sumar’s strongarm tactics when it came to bringing Podemos into the alliance. Podemos finally agreed to join Sumar last month, but the deal was fraught, not least because Díaz’s group refused to countenance the candidacy of Podemos’s Irene Montero. Montero, who serves as equality minister, was the main proponent and defender of a botched and unpopular sexual consent law under which more than 100 sex offenders were inadvertently released from jail. “One of the challenges is how you inspire and mobilise these voters who are very disappointed for different reasons,” says Simón. “Some are disappointed by Podemos’s performance in government; some are disappointed because they haven’t seen any real change or improvement in their lives, and some are disappointed because of the way the coalition was put together or because Irene Montero isn’t on the ticket. “There are complicated challenges, but a lot depends on whether Sumar can get across the message that ‘we’re the ones who can push the Socialists into making leftwing policies’.” Simón points out that while some senior Podemos figures have defected gladly to Sumar, some of those who opposed the collaboration are engaged in a more “nihilistic” game. “There are also some sectors within Podemos that know they’re not going to play any part in any future [Socialist]-Sumar coalition government,” he says. “Because of that, they want things to go badly for Sumar, because if that happens, they’ll not only thwart their rivals, they’ll also have been proved right when they said Podemos should have been the central player. That would also give them the chance to return to opposition in a stronger position.” Patrick English, an associate director at YouGov, says the race is too close to call, adding that despite the PP’s lead, leftwing and smaller nationalist parties could still win enough seats to keep the right out of government. “Given the ultra-competitiveness of seat allocation within the Spanish electoral system and the fact that we are still two weeks out from voting itself, it remains everything to play for,” he says. Díaz, and Spain, will soon find out whether Sumar is up to the challenges it faces. “Parties are odd tools that should serve to improve people’s lives,” she said in Madrid last week. “You’ll always find me working for my country and to improve people’s lives.” She also revisited that newspaper interview. “That was a pretty controversial headline,” she said. “But I think I had a feeling for what was going on in our country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T18:28:32Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant will not harm the nature reserve next to it | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/02/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-will-not-harm-the-nature-reserve-next-to-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Minsmere in Suffolk is often described as the “jewel in the crown” of RSPB nature reserves.

Arturo, a longstanding Argentinian exile, is still coming to terms with the terrible things he saw during the days of the junta. Sarah, an architect and soon-to-be-grandmother, is struggling with her Christian faith and the consequences of a broken friendship. Fred, who works for HM Revenue and Customs, fears he may be about to lose his job, the victim of a cover-up over a company tax evasion. But in Oscar Zarate’s hefty and involving new graphic novel, it isn’t their worries that bond this trio so much as their newfound enthusiasm for the 18th-century watercolourist Thomas Girtin. Over dinner at one another’s houses, they’re soon talking of little else. Such passion may be traced back originally to Fred, for it was he who first found himself spellbound by Girtin’s uncommon talent, beguiled by how relatively little is known about the artist, and frustrated that so much of his work is hidden from public view; his enthusiasm was catching. Girtin, a friend and rival of J M W Turner, died in 1802 at the aged of just 27, and there are those who believe that had he grown old, he would have become the greater artist of the two, a conviction Turner may have shared. “Had poor Tom lived, I would have starved,” Turner is supposed to have said after Girtin’s untimely death (the result, probably, of an asthma attack). Turner is known particularly to have admired Girtin’s exquisite and widely celebrated The White House at Chelsea (1800), a picture now in the collection of Tate Britain, where it can be seen only by appointment. Zarate’s graphic novel has two time frames. In the first, we follow the three friends as they attend to the various shadows in their lives, and pursue their new interest in Girtin; here are London pubs, London bus queues, and many late nights spent in the blue glow of a laptop. In the second, we travel back in time to revolutionary Europe, when the young Girtin, his hair cut as outrageously short as Danton’s, was leading his own insurgence, hellbent on finding an artistic language that would capture nature as it really was. Zarate’s drawings in both realms are intensely atmospheric, but it’s in the candlelight and sepia shades of the 18th century that he’s at his best, not least because he knows his limitations. Rather than trying and failing to play the copyist, he has chosen simply to reproduce several of Girtin’s greatest paintings, sometimes on double pages that fold outwards, almost as if this were a sketch book. The result is deeply satisfying and, at moments, spectacular. If this is a story about the power of art and the role it can play in enriching everyday lives, it’s also a pretty nimble biography – and if it leaves you wanting to know more, you’ll find your starting point here, too. The novel comes with an enlightening afterword by Dr Greg Smith, a senior research fellow at the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and the man responsible for the catalogue raisonné of Girtin’s work that was finally published online last year.

The weights, meanwhile, are headed by Frodon, the King George VI Chase winner over track and trip in 2020 and third home in the same race two months ago. Frodon, who won his most recent start in a handicap in the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton in November, is just 3lb higher on Saturday and will go to post with a serious chance, not least if Bryony Frost can get him into a rhythm in front. He could well be taken on in front, however, with both Annsam and Bobhopeornohope likely to vie for the lead, and Our Power (3.00), an eight-length third behind Cap Du Nord 12 months ago, is more appealing at around 7-1. Sam Thomas’s lightly raced eight-year-old was a cosy winner at Ascot on his seasonal debut in October and is up just 5lb for that success, a rise that should not be beyond him given that this will be just his eighth start over fences. Lingfield 1.30 Miss Nay Never is the latest excellent advert for John Quinn’s Malton yard, with eight wins from 12 starts on the all-weather since her debut on an artificial surface in November 2020. She looks more than ready for this step up to Listed company. Kempton 1.50 Rare Middleton had any amount in hand on his hurdles debut at Taunton last month and can improve past his more experienced opponents. Lingfield 2.05 As he was when a beaten favourite for this race last year, Lord North is well clear on ratings but returning from a break. Tyrrhenian Sea, a half-length second in the Easter Classic last season, could be a decent alternative at around 7-1. Kempton 2.25 One win from five starts over fences is not Grade Two-winning form on the face of it, but Datsalrightgino has been contesting strong handicaps and his latest run into second behind Stage Star at Cheltenham suggests he is well worth a try at this level. Newcastle 3.25 A typically competitive renewal of the Eider Chase, but Kitty’s Light has been eased a little in the weights having raced at around three miles so far this season, and could well return to the form that saw him finish a strong second in last year’s Scottish National – from an 11lb higher mark – now that he is back at a marathon trip.

In an interview with Guardian Australia, Wong also signalled that she planned to make further visits to south-east Asia and the Pacific to reassure the region that Australia does not seek to escalate military tensions. After the announcement of a multi-decade plan that could cost as much as $368bn between now and the mid-2050s, Wong said no rational observer could conclude Australia was the source of a regional arms race. She urged China to take up a US offer to agree on “guardrails” to avoid an outbreak of war, despite the concept being derided by Beijing last week. Australia has previously accused China of lacking transparency about its own rapid military buildup. “Nobody wants to see escalation. Nobody wants to see a miscalculation,” Wong said on Tuesday. “I think the region is entitled to seek that the great powers manage competition respectfully and appropriately.” Hours after the Aukus plans were announced by the US, the UK and Australia on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry repeated its longstanding position that the deal reflected “a typical Cold War mentality” that would stimulate an arms race and “sabotage” the international nuclear non-proliferation system. China’s mission to the UN also denounced the “irony” that “two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state”. When asked about that comment, Wong said: “That response is not grounded in fact.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Wong said Australia had been “very clear” that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. She also said “a number of other countries have” nuclear-powered submarines – and they were allowed under the NPT. “Australia’s motivation is peace,” she said. Observers say the Aukus arrangement is novel, because it would be the first time that fissile material and nuclear technology had been transferred from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. But the Australian government is believed to disagree with this being characterised as a “loophole”, and it has promised not to enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel as part of the program. Wong vowed to continue talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in place “the highest quality arrangement … to ensure this material is managed in a way that is consistent with the NPT”. The UK and the US say they will provide Australia with nuclear material in “complete, welded nuclear power units that will not require refuelling” during the more than 30-year lifetime of the submarines. In a fact sheet issued on Tuesday, the Australian government added: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” The government has, however, promised to store the nuclear waste in Australia in a location yet to be decided. In recent weeks, Australian ministers and officials have paved the way for the Aukus announcement in a series of calls and meetings with counterparts across the Indo-Pacific. But ambassadors in Canberra are expected to be briefed in detail over the coming days. Australian officials contacted their counterparts in Beijing on Monday to offer a briefing. Wong said the government had put in place “a comprehensive strategy” leading up to the announcement and made it a priority to re-engage with the Pacific and south-east Asia “in a very focused way”. The Aukus plan would give Australia “a greater capability of contributing to that strategic equilibrium which is necessary for the sort of region we all want to live in”. “Certainly it gives Australia a capability that very few countries have and that comes with responsibilities, which we are very aware of,” Wong said, adding that the plans would not undercut diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions. “Our focus and our attention should be on averting conflict, on keeping the region stable, peaceful and prosperous, and ensuring that sovereignty can be protected.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said the best way to reassure the region would be for Australia to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Indonesia – which joined with Malaysia to raise strong concerns about Aukus after it was first announced in 2021 – responded more cautiously on Tuesday. The Indonesian foreign ministry said it was the responsibility of all countries to maintain peace and stability in the region, and it expected Australia to develop “a verification mechanism that is effective, transparent and non-discriminatory”. On the eve of the announcement, China’s nationalistic Global Times newspaper quoted Chinese analysts as claiming Australia was “planting a time bomb” and would bear the cost of its “expensive mistake”. But the incoming Australian ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, said last week Aukus should be seen in the context of China’s own push to build the world’s largest navy. China currently operates 56 submarines, of which 12 are nuclear-powered, according to the latest Pentagon assessment. Australia plans to buy at least three and as many as five Virginia-class submarines from the US in 2030s. The first Australian-built submarines, based on a yet-to-be-completed British design, should enter into service in the 2040s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/11/colombia-world-cup-journey-england-quarter-final","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-11T14:54:21Z","webTitle":"Powerful and defiant: how Colombia’s World Cup journey gripped a nation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/colombia-world-cup-journey-england-quarter-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/11/colombia-world-cup-journey-england-quarter-final","fields":{"bodyText":"It was with that one striking image, one muggy Friday night in Cali 13 months ago, that Colombia’s World Cup journey began. Fists clenched and arms thrust up into the night sky, the national team players belted out the national anthem before their opening qualifier against Paraguay with a message of resistance that was unequivocal in its demand for change. Powerful and defiant, it was the moment the women’s team had boldly, yet impudently, seized the stage. A day earlier, football league chiefs had sparked outrage by scrapping a long-promised commitment for a domestic tournament during the second half of the year. “There’s just no interest,” Felipe Jaramillo, the president of the Colombian top division, said. “We can’t have a league with just a few teams.” That same old excuse, echoed from the male-dominated top of the women’s game, had been heard time and time again. The record needed to change. Colombia’s road to Australia and New Zealand began with a 4-2 win in front of 20,000 yellow shirts, who chanted their support for the raised-fist protest from the stands. The iconic photo of the players standing together in solidarity was quickly splashed across social media. In the next day’s papers, it would overshadow news of their victory. Jaramillo’s statement, coming on the eve of last summer’s women’s Copa América that Colombia was hosting for the first time, had provided the spark for the players to take a stand. Half the squad played locally and they, alongside more than 300 league players, looked into the impending future and saw only dark uncertainty. The players had gambled that by shining a spotlight on the repeated injustices in the game, they would be protected by a booming interest for women’s football across the country. A good performance at a tournament held on home soil and their soaring popularity would only solidify the cause. But the risk was great as many before them would attest. Star players such as Natalia Gaitan, Yoreli Rincón and Vanessa Córdoba had previously spoken out against abuses in the women’s game. Yet their uncomfortable truths were never addressed and none of them have played for the national team since. Still at the top of their game, they argue that they remain blacklisted. This time, however, the silent protest paid off. Colombia would go on to book their place at the 2023 World Cup after winning five out of six matches at the Copa. Despite losing 1-0 to Brazil in the final, they were the only country to give the eight-time South American champions a game. The gap between Colombia and the top was narrowing. With each victory, support from the public swelled. Bars filled with fans, stadiums were sold out and the team was considered likeable, passionate and fiercely united. “I much prefer them to the men’s team. They’re down to earth and put everything on the line,” Camilo, a Bogotá cafe owner says. “That’s what you want to see when you see your country play.” In tactfully defying their football bosses, Colombia’s players had also unwittingly unleashed a new battled-hardened personality that was seemingly harnessed from the frustrations of the past. In spite of all the abuses, the rampant misogyny, injustices and complete lack of support from above, they had toiled on tirelessly to achieve a place in the nation’s conscience. In the public’s mind, they had won immense respect. Against Ireland in their now infamous pre-World Cup friendly, Colombia were accused of being “overly physical” in the behind-closed-doors game. Yet when a video emerged of the foul that sparked the Irish team to walk off after only 20 minutes, unanimous cries of disbelief rang out that a European team could be so delicate over a “simple tackle”. Deep down, most Colombians glowed. It was this gladiatorial grit that had been absent in many Tricolor teams that had come before. This was a side that had matured to scrap out results and play hard when it mattered. Yet they were also blessed with talent, encapsulated by the genius of Linda Caicedo, who was emerging as a national hero. When needed, they could turn on the style. That one name was on everyone’s lips. When Colombia kicked off their World Cup against South Korea in Melbourne, a record 9 million people tuned in to watch a confident 2-0 victory, secured once again by Caicedo. Already one of the world’s best, her life charts a remarkable story. Having finished top scorer in the Colombian league aged 16, she then overcame ovarian cancer before joining Real Madrid on her 18th birthday this year. Having already represented her country with the Under-17s and Under-20s, this is her third World Cup in the past 12 months. Across Colombia’s capital Bogotá, Caicedo’s infectious smile is plastered everywhere. There’s currently no bigger star. Yet it was against Germany that the pre-tournament outsiders came of age. Several million again tuned in back home, despite having to set their alarms for 4.30am. But in a land of coffee, staying awake wasn’t a problem. “I couldn’t give a flying fuck if it was Germany,” captain, Catalina Usme, said after an injury-time winner sent Colombia into ecstasy with a historic 2-1 victory over one of the favourites. “But we aren’t here to beat Germany. We’re here to win the World Cup.” Such confidence and focus now await England when the two countries meet in Sydney on Saturday. The Lionesses are heavy favourites, but have stuttered their way through the tournament so far while Colombia are poised to again upset the odds. Having already made history by reaching the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time, the only South American nation left in the competition have been steadily scaling a fearless upward trajectory. Their battle for respect and dignity in their relationship with their country’s football authorities is far from over. As a recent report released by Colombian players’ association Acolfutpro revealed, things on the ground are slowly improving but there is still far to go. Almost half of Colombia’s 23-player squad will return home after this tournament with no competitive league football in store for the rest of the year. That’s the new battleground, a year-long tournament. But first, England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/11/science-chloe-kelly-penalty-england-nigeria","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-11T11:21:18Z","webTitle":"Speed, angle and confidence: science behind Chloe Kelly’s powerful penalty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/11/science-chloe-kelly-penalty-england-nigeria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/11/science-chloe-kelly-penalty-england-nigeria","fields":{"bodyText":"Arms out, leg cocked: as England’s Chloe Kelly took her penalty against Nigeria the forward was, she later said, confident of scoring. She not only won the game for the Lionesses, she set the record for the fastest shot in the Women’s World Cup so far. According to data from the official match ball, the shot on Monday reached 110.79km/h (69mph) – a speed that beats the most powerful strike of the 2022-23 Premier League campaign, by West Ham’s Saïd Benrahma, that clocked in at 107.2km/h (66.6mph). “Chloe’s penalty was just quite remarkable,” said Dr Ken Bray, of the University of Bath. “It was a very, very powerful hit.” Dr Alexandra Atack, an associate professor of biomechanics at St Mary’s University, Twickenham, said multiple factors contribute to the power of a kick. “The speed of the ball is determined by the speed of the kicking foot when it makes contact with the ball and how efficient the foot-ball collision is in transferring the energy,” she said. Among the factors affecting foot speed were the motion of the hip and knee joints of the kicking leg, the speed and angle of the kicker’s approach, the motion of the stance leg, and rotation of the upper body, Atack said. “The amount of energy these actions can generate and how they are coordinated will influence the kicking foot speed towards the ball,” she said, adding that the efficiency of the foot-ball collision was down to which part of the foot made contact with the ball, and the rigidity of the ankle during the impact. “The harder the collision, the faster the ball speed afterwards.” Bray said that while there were optimum places to aim for in the goal , in particular, the top right- or left-hand corners, the speed of the ball mattered. “You’ve got to get the ball moving at a certain rate, because what you want to do is beat the goalie’s reaction time,” he said. Simple penalty-taking tips included approaching the ball at a 45-degree angle, and bringing the heel of the kicking leg close to the bottom before striking, but Atack said that at the top level of football a penalty kick was a whole-body action. “Body size, shape, and [a player’s] physical characteristics [such as their strength and power capacities] can influence how an individual is best able to generate the required energy,” she said. Individual techniques also mattered. “When taking a penalty kick, David Beckham approached the ball from a wide angle and leant a long way over to the stance leg-side during the kicking action,” said Atack. “In contrast, Cristiano Ronaldo took a much straighter approach and remained more upright throughout the kicking action.” What’s more, the technique used will depend on where the kick is being taken from on the pitch and whether, for example, a curved trajectory is needed. Prof Mark Lake, of Liverpool John Moores University, noted that Kelly had a slightly “bouncing” approach to the penalty – involving a hop technique. “The raised left foot at the start does not have much to do with the power of the kick but rather to initiate the practised rhythm of the action and to ensure an accurate foot-ball contact for max power,” he said, adding that Kelly enhanced her foot velocity by the substantial lean of her standing leg, allowing her more rotational swing on her kicking leg. “Then she has good rotational follow-through of the kicking leg after ball contact. This technique mimics the actions of male players who also have strong kicking performance,” he said. Bray said that, although it was not clear from video footage, Kelly’s right foot may have been pointing slightly towards the left when she kicked the ball – an unconventional position that “would have imparted some topspin which would help to keep the ball down when it was hit with such power”. Atack added that while it was impossible to fully understand how Kelly produced such a fast kick without performing a full-body biomechanical analysis, the footballer’s confidence may also have mattered. “It is likely that she approached the ball with real intent and therefore, could use the energy generated as she approached the ball quickly to achieve a faster kicking foot and therefore, ball speed,” Atack said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
