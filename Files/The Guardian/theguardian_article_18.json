Though renewable energy could meet 100% of demand by 2025 at certain times of day at current rates of progress – a trend that could be turbocharged with active support from the federal government – the prospect of an Australian nuclear power station still looms large in the public conversation. Here is what we know about the pros and cons of nuclear power in an Australian context. Why was nuclear never adopted in Australia? Australian governments have always talked about building nuclear power plants but never actually followed through. While Australia holds 31% of the world’s supply of uranium, it has always been cheaper to rely on an ocean of cheap coal, gas and oil for power. Australia’s only nuclear reactor, at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, is for scientific and medical research, and produces mostly low-level waste. Why has the idea been revived now? Nuclear power appears to solve a political dilemma. As it does not rely on fossil fuels, some who care about the climate emergency see it as the fastest way to deliver zero-carbon power. Others who rightly point out that moving away from fossil fuels will hit working-class regions hardest see the “dispatchable power” offered by nuclear reactors as the basis of a new social compact that will pay high salaries while “firming” up the grid. On Monday BHP’s vice-president of sustainability and climate, Dr Fiona Wild, called for Australia to consider nuclear due to the urgency of the threat of climate collapse. “We don’t have time to choose our favourite technologies any more, we kind of need to take an ‘all of the above’ approach because the challenge is so great and the pace at which we need to move is so fast that you want to make sure you have all those options available,” Wild said. On Tuesday the Australian newspaper’s contributing economics editor, Judith Sloan, defended the “plight of nuclear power”. “As an energy crisis affects most of the world, with soaring gas, coal and electricity prices, it is surely time for Australia to have a rational debate about nuclear power leading to a definite outcome,” Sloan said. Do the costs and benefits make sense? The idea of establishing a nuclear power industry has been periodically investigated by governments. South Australia did the homework for the rest of the nation in 2015 with a royal commission. A federal parliamentary inquiry followed up in 2019. The results were mixed. The royal commission concluded nuclear power was out of reach. The federal inquiry recommended that any such project should only go ahead if there was broad support from the public – an extremely unlikely prospect. While both reports agreed “next generation” reactors showed promise, nuclear power as a whole remained a time and money sink. As of 2019, the cost of a nuclear power plant had risen to US$1bn for 100MW of generation capacity. Construction of a commercial-scale plant would take at least 15 years. If Australia had started work on a nuclear reactor before the pandemic, it would not be in operation until about 2035. The small or “modular” reactors that are held up as the future of the industry won’t be affordable until 2050. Could they help to reduce emissions? Nuclear power is not carbon neutral. While the act of generating power itself is fairly efficient and low-emitting, the process of mining the uranium, trucking it somewhere to be refined and pouring the concrete to build the plant creates significant emissions. As uranium is a finite resource, nuclear power is also not “renewable”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Renewables, of course, share similar problems because so many other systems still rely on fossil fuels – wind turbine towers require steel, PV solar cells need resins, everything relies on diesel to transport it – but the total CO2 emissions are minute and the rapid rate of installation means there is a better shot at decarbonising these processes more quickly than with nuclear. With dirt cheap PV solar and rapid improvements being made in hydrogen and battery technology, it will only get easier. What about stabilising the grid? Critics of renewable energy sources say they do not have the capacity to respond to periods of high electricity demand with “dispatchable power” on calm, cloudy days, because they depend on the wind and sun. Nuclear, it is argued, can substitute effectively for the industrial-scale fossil fuel plants now in use that can idle up or down according to demand. The problems with renewables are real but they are becoming less of a roadblock. Plans are in train to make Australia’s power grid more decentralised with a combination of PV solar, offshore wind and onshore wind working to pick up any slack in the system when one goes offline. With the addition of battery technology to store and deliver electricity on demand, the business case for nuclear starts to look pretty thin. The challenge of renewables Thanks to the uptake of PV solar on rooftops it is costing coal and gas power plants more to keep running during periods of low demand and high supply. Operators are faced with a choice: push through or power down. In Australia, operators of ageing coal plants have so far chosen to push through but, as periods of oversupply become more frequent, the costs will make it more attractive to turn off the generator. Firing them back up again is another expensive process – one not shared by renewables, which can be turned on or off quickly. Australia is a long way from hitting peak renewable energy, and there is time to resolve the challenges associated with it long before any nuclear plant would have a chance to make it off a whiteboard. Should trends hold, breaking ground on a new nuclear plant today would mean committing to a white elephant that would be too expensive even to turn on. Any other problems? All of this is without even talking about plans to handle the decommissioning of old nuclear reactors at the end of their lifecycle or the storage of spent nuclear fuel – another expensive, time-consuming process. Australia already struggles with decommissioning and rehabilitating old mine sites, and nuclear power presents new challenges. There are few good facilities anywhere in the world with a geology or a political environment stable enough to store this material long term. During its royal commission, SA considered building its own facility to store waste but failed to get support from the public, thanks in part to the legacy of nuclear weapons testing at Maralinga. The federal government is working on a separate plan to build a storage facility for low-level and intermediate waste at Kimba in SA but the process has proved divisive. Under the proposal, this facility would not be equipped to handle spent nuclear fuel, and to scale it up would mean starting all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T09:00:33Z","webTitle":"They wield huge power over your day-to-day life, without consent or oversight.

Asset managers | Brett Christophers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","fields":{"bodyText":"Asset managers are key figures in your life, although you may not be aware of it. These investment firms are mostly recognised for their ownership of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. But as well as owning financial assets, in recent decades they have been buying huge volumes of so-called “real assets”, which in many cases represent necessities of everyday life such as housing, schools, care homes, roads, energy systems, farmland and water-supply networks. Thus, the regular payments to asset owners that we make to stay alive and thrive – such as for shelter, electricity, water or food – increasingly end up in part or in full in the hands of asset managers. Those managers decide both how much we pay, and what condition the apartment, care home or pipes that supply our drinking water are in. Observers have noted isolated, individual examples of this phenomenon. However, the dots have not been joined. The common thread that weaves together such seemingly disparate examples as embattled Danish apartment tenants, beleaguered US care-home residents and indignant UK water rate-payers has been ownership – that is, asset-manager ownership. Today, such is the breadth and depth of this phenomenon that the lives of few people anywhere in the world are untouched by asset managers’ tentacles. And some of us, especially in the global north, are thoroughly entangled: we effectively live in an asset-manager society. Consider that just one asset manager, Australia’s Macquarie, owns infrastructure internationally on which more than 100 million people rely every single day. If their control of essential infrastructure gives asset managers direct power over the conditions and costs of our daily lives, they also enjoy a more indirect form of power. For a variety of reasons, including the growing amount of capital at their command (now in excess of $100tn), leading asset managers today possess formidable power to shape government policy, not least regarding the types of real assets that they themselves increasingly control. Whereas in the past governments leaned heavily on banks for advice on financial matters (but not only those), now it is principally asset managers that have their ear. Consider two striking examples from the US. Amid the detritus of the 2008–10 financial crisis, a key concern was housing finance. What was the Obama administration to do about the millions of mortgaged homeowners who were in negative equity and facing foreclosure? The treasury team that advised Obama hired multiple recruits from the asset manager Blackstone. The outcome? Policies that not only failed the foreclosed, but simultaneously enabled Blackstone itself to cheaply assemble a vast, profitable portfolio of rental homes, largely out of those properties that were foreclosed upon. Meanwhile, since Joe Biden became president, a more pressing concern has been climate finance. How should the US finance the infrastructure investment required for climate mitigation and adaptation? In this case the key policymaking entity has been the National Economic Council. Its director until February this year? The ex-head of “sustainable investing” at BlackRock. And the outcome? A policy based on government subsidisation of investment in clean-energy infrastructure by private-sector actors such as BlackRock itself. All this raises a crucial question. If asset managers really do possess such power over our daily lives via the infrastructure that we depend intimately upon, why have observers not been more aware of the fact? Bruce Flatt, the head of Brookfield Asset Management, one of the leading players in real-asset investment, has provided perhaps the best explanation. “What we do is behind the scenes,” he told the Financial Times. “Nobody knows we’re there.” It’s high time these firms, and their power, were brought into the light.

A medieval story about the divine right of kings, it is performed by five actors, all in casual modern dress, on a stage stripped of any opulence. Anna Coombs’s adaptation is pared down to a drama about leadership with only 10 characters (as opposed to more than 30 in Shakespeare), its focus on patriarchal power and family betrayal. This makes it intimate, intense, and almost claustrophobic. The stage is strewn with spotlights and ladders – the latter a visual metaphor for Bolingbroke’s ascent to Richard’s throne and this set (designed by Colin Falconer) exposes both the stage workings and inner machinations of power. Produced by Tangle Theatre (which amplifies African and Caribbean voices) in association with MAST Mayflower Studios, it comes with a live score of Zimbabwean songs composed and directed by John Pfumojena. Actors double up as singers and the production’s musicality is central to its power, bringing great potent surges. Most strikingly, the female characters, already marginal in the original text, are absent. Also directed by Coombs, its study is patriarchy in its purest form: male bloodlines – fathers, sons, uncles and cousins – jostling aggressively for supremacy. All the more so with only one female actor in the cast – Lebogang Fisher, who plays Aumerle, who is a more central figure here. Actors double up and make each character distinct for the main part; the ensemble is strong, although some verse is spoken over-emphatically. Raheim Menzies plays Bolingbroke with an upstanding, military air and a Coventry accent, sharply distinct from the flowery RP spoken by Daniel Rock as Richard. Although he is the king’s first cousin, it is made plain that there is a social distinction between them and one which Bolingbroke uses to rally the masses against Richard’s irresponsible rule. Rock is best in his early scenes, displaying callow haughtiness and speaking the verse with crisp clarity. Sibusiso Mamba, playing various parts, is a strong presence along with Fisher. Percussive music heightens the tension and lighting (designed by Hansjörg Schmidt) defines the mood; the spotlights create an almost spooky effect, with some brightly lit, others whispering in shadows. It looses its tautness towards the end, but is well worth watching with a central concept that makes this play’s questions about leadership freshly relevant. Richard the Second is at Omnibus theatre, London, until 27 November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T08:35:56Z","webTitle":"Women pushed even further from power in Xi Jinping’s China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China’s leadership has remained unchanged. It is all-male. Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping’s “new era” of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country. The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made president or premier. Today under Xi, the CCP took a step back, also eliminating women from the next level of power too, the now 24-member Politburo. The new all-male line-up was revealed the day Xi formally extended his rule for a further five years, after the closing of the 20th Communist party congress in Beijing. Since 1997, there had always been at least one female Politburo member, and briefly two. A quota system required at least one woman in senior leadership at each level below that, contributing a small but steady stream of candidates. The Covid tsar, Sun Chunlan, was the only woman on the outgoing Politburo, and one of only three women who have made it that far as political operators in their own right – rather than as wives of powerful men or propaganda tools – in over 70 years of Communist rule. Her politburo seat was thought to be earmarked for another woman after she stepped down, with two candidates named as likely frontrunners. But in a weekend of disturbing surprises, including the manhandling of former President Hu Jintao off the stage, the CCP revealed an all-male Politburo. “Chinese women have been excluded from the centre of political power at both local and central levels,” said Hsiu-hua Shen, professor of Sociology at Taiwan’s National Tsing Hua University, before the conference closed. “Without specific affirmative actions … it is very difficult for Chinese women to be able to enter political systems and shape policies.” An uneasy relationship The party was formed during a civil war, in a highly patriarchal society and has been based on “masculine violence” and power struggles since its establishment, Shen added. The CCP has nearly 100 million members, but less than a third of the rank and file are women, and the numbers thin out, the higher up its ranks you climb. “China’s patriarchal political structure limits women’s upward mobility,” said Pan Wang, senior lecturer in Chinese and Asian studies at the University of New South Wales. “From the bottom to the top of the pyramid, women get fewer at each step of the hierarchy (from CCP members, to the party congress, central committee and the politburo). This can create biases in the nomination and selection process for leading positions in the party/state.” Chinese women are held back by a variety of factors, Pan said. They include cultural expectations that women do more in the home, a career structure that forces them to retire earlier than men, just as they might be reaching their professional peak, and education and socialisation that discourages them from political ambitions. The CCP has always had an uneasy relationship with feminists, in part because Communists claim to have liberated women themselves. Mao’s slogan “women hold up half the sky” became famous as half-tribute, half-promise to China’s women. That makes any woman still fighting for her rights potentially subversive, particularly at a time when Xi is openly distrustful of any civil organising. There have been repeated crackdowns on feminists, including arrests of women protesting against issues that do not obviously challenge the political system, such as sexual harassment. China’s #MeToo movement has made little progress. Among the ranks of assembled dignitaries at the Party congress was Zhang Gaoli, the former vice-premier whom tennis champion Peng Shuai publicly accused of sexual assault last year. Peng went missing for weeks after making her accusations on social media. She was eventually seen in public after a high-profile international campaign, organised under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai, but has since kept a very low profile and said her post was misunderstood, while he still commands the political stage. “The CCP is still quite traditional when it comes to women at the very top. Recent crackdowns on feminist activists have further signalled a more traditionalist and conservative line,” said Mary Gallagher, professor of democracy, democratization and human rights at the University of Michigan. Communism made it easier for women to get an education and join the workforce, but as in many other countries they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, a “double shift” that is tiring and limits career opportunities. With a falling birthrate on the brink of tipping China’s already fast-ageing population into decline, there is increasing pressure on young people to have more children. Academics and campaigners fear that may further hobble women’s hopes of getting more political power in China. “I fear that in the short term, China will follow other countries and restrict women’s access to abortion and contraception as a way to force women to have more children. Ultimately, these policies will backfire and fail, but they could increase repression and crackdowns on feminist politics,” Gallagher said. ‘One woman is OK’ Requiring a minimal role for female cadres has opened the door a crack, but as the new Politburo line-up showed, has not changed a misogynist political culture. “The party has addressed it but in a relatively vague manner, if you look at the party constitution, there is a line about promoting women party members in leadership,” said Minglu Chen, senior lecturer in the Department of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney. “In reality this policy has often been interpreted as “one woman is OK”, so there is only one woman. This obviously shows the quota system being adopted is effective, but more needs to be done.” And for nearly 700 million women who live in China, this is not just a matter of principle. “The one thing we could safely argue, with no woman in leadership, women’s issues would be under-represented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T11:00:17Z","webTitle":"Leaked: US power companies secretly spending millions to protect profits and fight clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/27/leaked-us-leaked-power-companies-spending-profits-stop-clean-energy","fields":{"bodyText":"The CEO of the biggest power company in the US had a problem. A Democratic state senator was proposing a law that could cut into Florida Power &amp; Light’s (FPL) profits. Landlords would be able to sell cheap rooftop solar power directly to their tenants – bypassing FPL and its monopoly on electricity. “I want you to make his life a living hell … seriously,” FPL’s CEO Eric Silagy wrote in a 2019 email to two of his vice-presidents about state Senator José Javier Rodríguez, who proposed the legislation. Within minutes, one of them forwarded the directive to the CEO of Matrix, LLC, a powerful but little-known political consulting firm that has operated behind the scenes in at least eight states. Rodríguez was ousted from office in the next election. Matrix employees spent heavily on political advertisements for a candidate with the same last name as Rodríguez, who split the vote. That candidate later admitted he was bribed to run. Hundreds of pages of internal documents – which are only coming to light now because Matrix’s founders are locked in an epic feud – detail the firm’s secret work to help power companies like FPL protect their profits and fight the transition to cleaner forms of energy. The Matrix saga illustrates the political obstacles policymakers and experts face as they attempt to cut climate pollution from the power sector, one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors in the US. The ongoing clash between Matrix’s founder Joe Perkins, 72, and former CEO Jeff Pitts, 51, is exposing the firm’s decades of extensive influence peddling on behalf of utility clients. The issue extends to several states. Records obtained by Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel show that Matrix consulted for FPL, as well as another Florida company, Gulf Power, and Alabama Power. Matrix affiliated groups have also worked to advance power companies’ interests in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, public records show. In Florida, Matrix’s work touched almost every level of politics, from influencing local mayoral and county commission elections to combating attempts to reshape the state constitution. In each of those cases, Matrix was working against politicians or policies fighting to curb the climate crisis by encouraging renewable power. Matrix employees had a Jacksonville journalist spied on after he wrote critically about FPL. And in 2020, Matrix even harnessed the power of the press for itself, when its employees acquired control of The Capitolist, a Tallahassee-based political news site which it used for favorable coverage, leaked records show. “I find this to be horrifying and undemocratic,” said Gianna Trocino Bonner, former chief legislative aide for Rodríguez, after reviewing some of the leaked documents. “It’s unfortunate that our process allows for something like this to exist without accountability.” Big power companies operate as monopolies with captive customers in much of the south-east US. They are supposed to be closely regulated, but their profits and unchecked political spending makes them some of the most powerful entities in a state. Howard Crystal, an attorney for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said that US utilities are allowed monopoly power “because they are supposed to expand the public interest. “[But] now we have this incredible corruption and a reversal of that because they are using their advantage to hang on to power and undermine democracy,” he said. So far, there have been two criminal investigations into the campaign against Rodríguez and another Democratic state senate candidate, leading to charges against five people, though authorities have not accused Matrix or FPL of wrongdoing. Matrix’s principal, Perkins, says he discovered only after Pitts left the firm that he and other now-former employees had been conducting “shadow activities and operations” dating back to 2016. He is suing Pitts in Alabama for fraud and conspiracy. “For many years and without my knowledge or approval, Pitts abused his power and position to benefit himself and his cronies,” Perkins said in a statement. “Upon realizing the extent of Pitts’s shadow operations and abuses of power, we filed our lawsuit against Pitts and those few rogue employees.” Pitts, who left Matrix in December 2020 to start his own firm, Canopy Partners, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. He is also suing Perkins, alleging defamation and extortion. A spokesperson for FPL said it stopped working with Canopy in late 2021. FPL’s CEO Silagy in a recent interview denied knowing about or participating in the scheme against Rodríguez but said that Matrix had done “good work” for his company. Records show FPL trusted Matrix operatives with millions, including giving $14m to a single Matrix-run nonprofit in 2018 alone. Silagy said the email in which he told his team to make Rodríguez’s life “a living hell” was “a poor choice of words”. Digging for dirt In Florida, FPL and Matrix demonstrated how a utility and its consultants can work in tandem to resist clean energy reforms. FPL deployed lobbyists to the capital, while Matrix hired private investigators to dig for dirt and had operatives funnel dark money and order attack ads. Few examples are clearer than the case of South Miami. When the small south Florida city’s mayor helped pass an ordinance in 2017 mandating rooftop solar panels on new construction, a network of 10 FPL-aligned operatives mobilized to ensure his ouster. The team decided an effort to repeal the ordinance would probably fail. So they opted instead for “Mayor Stoddard’s electoral defeat and changing the makeup of the board”, according to a 2018 memo from Dan Newman, a Matrix contractor who was similarly involved in the campaign against Rodríguez. Along with a private investigator, the group delved into Stoddard’s past for episodes to weaponize against him, such as a South Miami commissioner’s claim on Facebook that Stoddard had forcibly kissed her. Documents show Matrix operatives arranged for the commissioner to record a robocall in which she called Stoddard “a creep”. Pitts at the time forwarded a draft of the script to two FPL executives. Newman in his memo also took credit for a Miami Herald story about the allegation. Meanwhile, Matrix-led non-profits funded a blizzard of ads against Stoddard, accusing him of using public money for “vendettas” and placing him alongside infamous sex offenders Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. The plan ultimately failed, and Stoddard was re-elected. He has denied the allegations. “An organization that acts like a mafia should be treated like one,” Stoddard said. In a statement, Newman acknowledged managing the campaign against Stoddard and hiring a private investigator to look into the former mayor’s personal life. He said what he found was “deeply disturbing”. FPL did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Matrix’s influence was felt on matters small and large, from Stoddard’s city of less than 12,000 to statewide fights over the Florida constitution. In 2019, when the electric utility industry was up in arms about a constitutional amendment to open up competition in Florida’s energy market, a Matrix-linked non-profit poured more than $10m into groups fighting it. Matrix also exerted political influence through the press, with its operatives acquiring control of a Tallahassee-based politics news site, The Capitolist. That gave Matrix consultants and FPL executives input on Capitolist stories. The site’s publisher, Brian Burgess, a former top spokesperson for past Florida governor Rick Scott, also suggested in emails that Matrix should lure prominent Florida journalists to a new site or buy local papers owned by media giant Gannett Company and then lay off most of the “clown reporters” to “inject content” into publications without anyone knowing who was “pulling the strings”. That proposal was forwarded to Silagy at FPL but never came to fruition. Burgess said he “never pitched nor solicited feedback from FPL executives on any story or business venture”, and FPL spokesperson Chris McGrath said acquiring a news organization would not have made sense as a business deal for FPL. *** Headquartered in Montgomery, Matrix has been described there as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency”. Perkins and Pitts worked together for more than 25 years, expanding the firm into a national operation with dozens of clients in myriad industries. But wherever the pair went, indictments often followed. An Alabama governor the company worked for was convicted of federal felony corruption charges. A Birmingham mayor who employed Matrix got 15 years for bribery, conspiracy and fraud. And a former regional administrator for the EPA who did business with Pitts pleaded guilty to violating state ethics law multiple times. From the beginning, Matrix showed no aversion to unsavory political tactics. In 1998, the firm distributed copies of a video in which a sex worker falsely alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a candidate for lieutenant governor. The sex worker later testified the allegations were untrue, and that she had been paid by a Birmingham businessman to make them. In 2015, Matrix distributed fliers for a suspicious charity in a predominantly Black neighborhood in North Birmingham. The fliers warned residents not to let the Environmental Protection Agency test their soil for the presence of contaminants left by a coal plant. The charity was a front established by a state representative. A local law firm and the company that owned the coal plant used the charity to pay the representative. Three people were federally convicted for their role in the ploy. Matrix was never accused of wrongdoing. One of Matrix’s oldest clients is Alabama Power, which employed Perkins’ personal consulting firm as early as 1999. In 2018, Perkins Communications received at least $1.49m from Alabama Power, a leaked contract shows. Those who provoked the utility’s ire suffered a harsh response. In 2013, Terry Dunn, a Republican electricity regulator at Alabama’s Public Service Commission made moves to hold formal hearings on how customers’ energy bills were calculated – something that hadn’t happened in three decades. Customers at the time were paying some of the highest rates for electricity in the south-east. Soon, Dunn faced attacks in the rightwing press and online, while Matrix-affiliated groups – some of which received millions from a non-profit run by a contractor for Alabama Power – filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings. Meanwhile, groups aligned with the utility falsely tied Dunn to the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce the use of coal. The tactics worked. Dunn lost his 2014 re-election campaign by a 19-point margin to Chip Beeker, a catfish farmer who is still in office. Months after he was elected, Beeker voted in favor of an energy price hike for consumers. Alabama Power still hasn’t had a rate case. “Southern Company and Alabama Power run the state of Alabama,” Dunn said. “They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the firm’s activities. Perkins called Matrix’s work for the utility “confidential”. Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School said the “whole purpose” of firms like Matrix “is to conceal that it’s the utility doing this. The utility doesn’t want to be associated with this campaign.” Things start going ‘sideways’ Matrix grew so large that by 2015 it was operating several private aircraft to whisk Pitts and Perkins to client meetings. Flight data shows Matrix’s planes made more than 130 flights to five states in 2020 alone, frequently crisscrossing the south-eastern US but also traveling as far west as New Mexico. In Perkins’ telling, he was getting ready to hand over leadership of Matrix in December 2020 when Pitts surprised him by leaving the firm, taking three employees – as well as most of Matrix’s Florida-based clients – with him to launch Canopy. At the Birmingham office where Pitts and the others had worked, Perkins said he found a backup server that “appeared to have been beaten with something”. The firm later recovered more than a million files, according to Perkins, who said they reveal years of hidden, “shadow work” in Florida. Perkins and Pitts sued each other, with Pitts claiming his former mentor had “never followed through” on handing over the company despite years of discussions. Once he left, Pitts said Perkins smeared him to clients in an attempt to extort millions. As their feud escalated, internal documents started to arrive in reporters’ email inboxes from unknown sources. Many of the documents have since been verified by additional reporting, public records or Perkins himself. Silagy, the FPL CEO, says the pair initially told him they had come to an amicable agreement about parting ways. He says he told them that he was disappointed, but there was enough work for both of them, “based on the good work they had done”. “And then apparently, somewhere along the way, Jeff and Joe got sideways,” Silagy said.

Since then, its ruthlessness has only increased. The number of political prisoners has soared to more than 13,000. The junta has resumed executions for the first time in decades. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last Friday that the regime was using the death penalty to crush political opposition, expressing shock that 130 people have been sentenced to death by military courts behind closed doors. Many of the 1,700 people who have stood trial have been denied access to lawyers or relatives. Not one has been acquitted. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and uprisings elsewhere have meant that the world has largely stopped paying attention to events in Myanmar, where the military is literally pursuing a scorched earth policy. It has razed villages that it accuses of supporting the opposition and has bombed hospitals, schools and even a concert. An estimated 1.3 million people are displaced and living in horrific conditions. It continues to add to the raft of convictions and prison terms for Aung San Suu Kyi. Rights groups report extrajudicial killings by soldiers and militias. The assumption at first was that the military, long expert in suppressing stirrings of dissent and democracy, would soon reassert control. Even when some protesters took up arms – and the pro-democracy national unity government backed a “defensive war” – it seemed a hopeless endeavour, given their lack of money, equipment and training. Yet the resistance has been not only remarkably protracted but – under the circumstances – surprisingly effective. Civilian militias, working alongside some of the ethnic armed groups that were already battling the state, are carrying out attacks on military bases and in previously untouchable central areas. Soldiers are said to be quitting or defecting. The junta has also relied on Russia for much of its weaponry – though it can still count on China, India and others. Each fresh abuse by the regime gives opponents reason to fight on – no one believes it will compromise. Elections are promised next year, but the power seizure resulted from the military’s repeated failure to win at the ballot box, and opponents are all locked up. The regime made a vague attempt at PR by releasing 6,000 or more prisoners last month, including a former British ambassador, Vicky Bowman. But some were detained again on the same day, and the total number of those held soon rebounded. The junta remains grotesquely self-serving, with its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, spending a reported $33m on honours to keep its friends on side – in the process awarding himself two titles, one of which comes with an elaborate gold and ruby medal. Sanctions should remain carefully targeted at those in the regime and their families. Though supporters of the democracy movement praise the UK for taking the lead internationally, they believe much more must be done. They make a strong case for cutting off the supply of aviation fuel – used by the military even when it has supposedly been destined for civil flights. The junta’s increasing brutality, however, is a sign of fear as well as further evidence of its viciousness. Some of those struggling for democracy now speak not of a coup, but an attempted coup; thanks to the resistance, they say, it has not yet succeeded. They need more support to ensure that it does not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T08:00:44Z","webTitle":"Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew review – the terrible price of people power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Picture the scene. It’s 350BCE, and Aristotle – presumably looking a bit like Sir David Attenborough, except in a toga – is collecting creatures from the teeming rock pools around the Greek island of Lesbos. He’s beavering away on his scala naturae – a “natural ladder” that puts everything in the natural world in a hierarchy that has animate things such as minerals at the bottom, then plants above them, followed by animals. And of course, at the top of the ladder, tottering maniacally over everything else: humans. Beastly is Keggie Carew’s messy but heartfelt account of the environmental catastrophe unleashed by this barmily Trumpian idea of Aristotle’s that we’re somehow superior to the rest of nature. As Carew convincingly argues, the influential scala naturae “paved the philosophical way – nature was to serve us”. Over 380 or so charmingly meandering pages, Carew attempts to unpick Aristotle’s folly and fix “humanity’s big error – our interactions with the planet’s other inhabitants”. She does this in part by recounting the story of our intellectual journey – from ancient Greece to today – as philosophers, theologians and scientists first built on, then started to break away from, Aristotle’s worldview. Carew, author of the Costa book award-winning memoir Dadland (2016), does a great job of rattling through centuries of dusty theological thought and the way the likes of Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas fatefully concluded that animals don’t have souls so aren’t worthy of our care, or even our pity. As she observes, pithily: “Advocacy for kindness to fellow creatures under the Abrahamic god has never really caught on.” But over the past 20 years or so, scientific research has started to chip away at this human-centric view. In 2012, scientists from around the world signed the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, announcing that “the weight of evidence” shows “all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses” are conscious beings – a revolutionary moment, because it proves that animals aren’t “dumb beasts” that we can use and abuse, but feel pain and other emotions. Carew, though, isn’t especially wowed by this scientific sea change: “The extraordinary thing is that it took so long. More extraordinary still, perhaps, is that it needed to be stated at all.” Alongside this potted history of our philosophical understanding of nature, Carew describes, in myriad moving ways, the colossal environmental damage caused by our wrong-headedness. From the destruction of wild habitats (only 2.9% of land on Earth is “faunally intact” – the rest tarnished or ruined) to biodiversity loss everywhere, the book is brimming with examples of irrevocable harm. “Wherever we showed up,” notes Carew, darkly, “extinctions followed.” She writes poignantly about the suffering of the beautiful baiji, the Chinese river dolphin that was gradually overwhelmed by pollution, noise and over-fishing: “The baiji took more than 20m years of evolution to refine, and 50 years of grand communist-capitalist ideology to rub out.” The book’s structure is confusing at times, jumping between Carew’s personal memories, facts about one species or another and wide-ranging summaries of human history. Then again, maybe she is trying to mimic Charles Darwin’s famous “tangled bank” metaphor for how everything in nature is connected. Indeed, Carew is especially compelling when it comes to this interrelatedness, where the dying out of one species can cause entire ecosystems to decline and fall. Sea otters, for instance, were wiped out on America’s coasts, which meant that the urchins they ate multiplied unchecked, which in turn caused entire kelp forests to fail – killing off their inhabitants, including the gentle 10-tonne Steller’s sea cow. The disappearance of one creature can spell doom on a much larger scale. As Carew warns us: “We mess with these interactions at our peril, for they’re so immensely complex we do not understand them.” In place of Aristotle’s egocentric ladder, Beastly is a clarion call for the humbler notion that every bit of nature matters: “Our banners must shout more expansively: Save the whale! Save the krill! Save the phytoplankton! Save everything in between!” Time and again, Carew comes back to the psychological impact that losing wild places is having on us – sometimes called “solastalgia”: the sadness we feel as we wander through landscapes unnaturally devoid of insects, birds and animals. For Carew, as for many of us, this melancholy has given way to something darker: “A close cousin of solastalgia is eco-furiosity, an eco-tear-your-hair-out solastalgia on steroids. It is the long loud, desperate cry of the human heart.” The only hope for our battered planet is that we come to appreciate the wondrous interconnectedness of living things. As Carew wistfully puts it: “When we understand, we begin to care.” • Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew is published by Canongate (£20).

Government officials have been accused of being “obstructive and furthering their own agenda”, according to the committee on standards in public life, which pointed to an erosion of the normal conventions that govern civil servants’ relationship with ministers. In its submission to a parliamentary inquiry on Whitehall leadership and reform, the committee – which is chaired by a former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans – said ministers should be mindful of the power imbalance as public disparagement had consequences. It also said there had also been a rise in anonymous briefings from within the civil service, with some officials opposed to the government’s “willingness to test the boundaries of legality”. “In recent times there has been an erosion of the conventions that have governed the relationship, with public criticism of civil servants becoming increasingly disparaging in tone and an increase in anonymous briefings by civil servants to the media,” the committee said in evidence to the Commons public administration committee. “During and after our review, we heard examples of low civil service morale. There will be a range of factors to explain this, but public accusations of civil servants being obstructive and furthering their own agenda is undoubtedly damaging for staff retention and is unlikely to attract the very best people to work in the public sector.” The submission outlined findings from the committee’s report on leadership in public life, published earlier this year, which said it had heard that the government’s “willingness to test the boundaries of legality in challenging policy areas” had been difficult for some civil servants who had “struggled to reconcile their work with their own personal values”. It said ministers were right to expect high standards of their officials. It had been suggested to the committee that in some cases civil servants may mistake a feeling of “dislike or discomfort” over policy choices for ethical considerations that could constitute a breach of the civil service code, the submission said. The watchdog said civil servants must serve the government of the day impartially and if they felt unable to do that they must move roles or departments or leave. The committee was set up in 1994 under John Major. It advises the prime minister on upholding standards of conduct across public life in England. Its members include Lady Arden, a former supreme court justice, Dame Margaret Beckett, the former Labour minister, Ian Blackford, the former Westminster leader of the SNP, Lady Finn, a Conservative peer and former deputy chief of staff to Boris Johnson, Ewen Fergusson, a City lawyer, and Prof Gillian Peele. Evans is nearing the end of his five-year term at the helm, telling Sky News recently that he thought there should be more transparency about the source of political donations and suggesting a ceiling on the amount MPs can earn from second jobs. The inquiry on civil service leadership and reform was opened by the Commons public administration committee after a torrid period for relations between ministers and Whitehall, with relations hitting a low last year. In February 2022, Jacob Rees-Mogg, then the Cabinet Office minister, outlined huge job cuts and left “sorry you were out” notes on the desks of civil servants working from home. Since leaving office, Rees-Mogg has claimed “idle”, “workshy and snowflakey” civil servants frustrated his efforts to scrap EU laws. In April this year, Dominic Raab quit as deputy prime minister after he was found to have acted in an intimidating way towards civil servants. He then claimed to have been the subject of a concerted campaign by unionised officials trying to undermine him. Relations have also been strained by protracted pay disputes and strikes, as well as the sacking of Tom Scholar as the Treasury’s permanent secretary by Liz Truss during her brief time as prime minister. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, defended the civil service in July, saying criticism of officials had been “insulting and dehumanising”. He said any minister labelling the civil service with terms such as “the blob” would be engaged in “self-defeating cowardice”. Case, appointed under Boris Johnson, said relations had improved under Rishi Sunak since November but added: “The last five years or so have seen, I think, an increased number of attacks on civil servants individually and collectively by significant political figures which has undoubtedly undermined the good functioning of government.” Some quarters of Whitehall previously felt Case failed to defend them sufficiently after Raab’s attack on “unionised officials” and when some civil servants were under fire during the Partygate scandal. Earlier this year, the Institute for Government found that political turmoil had contributed to record levels of staff turnover and declining morale in the civil service. Lucille Thirlby, the assistant general secretary of the FDA union, said: “Civil servants have no right of reply to the accusations levelled at them by certain politicians, and also have no effective means of raising concerns about ministerial behaviour when the prime minister remains judge and jury on any complaints. “Our own survey of senior civil servants found over 17% had witnessed unacceptable behaviour by a minister, across 20 government departments, and nearly 70% said they did not have confidence that, if they raised a complaint, it would be dealt with fairly.” She said ministers must “heed the warning and seek to rebuild trust with civil servants, end the negative briefings, and ensure the civil service is able to recruit and retain the most talented people to deliver our vital public services.” Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, the biggest civil service union, said: “The best way for ministers to improve the morale, efficiency and productivity of civil servants is to treat them with the respect they deserve and give them a fair pay rise to help them through the cost of living crisis and beyond.” Asked about the committee’s submission, a government spokesperson said: “There is and always should be a professional and productive relationship between ministers and civil servants. The civil service continues to work closely and collaboratively with ministers to deliver for the public on the government’s priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T15:00:05Z","webTitle":"US-China war not inevitable, Albanese says, urging countries to ‘prevent a worst-case scenario’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/03/us-china-war-not-inevitable-albanese-says-urging-countries-to-prevent-a-worst-case-scenario","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese has warned against “harmful” assumptions that the US and China are heading towards an inevitable war, and called for “practical structures to prevent a worst-case scenario”. The Australian prime minister said a war in the Indo-Pacific would be “devastating for the world” and used a keynote speech to a regional security summit in Singapore to urge all countries to uphold peace and stability. Albanese also sought to reassure countries in the region that remain wary about Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. “In boosting our nation’s defence capability, Australia’s goal is not to prepare for war but to prevent it, through deterrence and reassurance and building resilience in the region.” Albanese said it must be “crystal clear that when it comes to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force – be it in Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea or elsewhere – the risk of conflict will always far outweigh any potential reward”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, are among security officials and analysts from more than 40 countries attending the three-day Shangri-La Dialogue. Albanese is accompanied on the trip by his defence minister, Richard Marles, who is expected to meet with Li this weekend. Marles attended the same summit last year in what marked the end of China’s freeze on high-level dialogue with Australia. Albanese said it was “dangerously wrong” for anyone to describe the region as “a potential ‘theatre’ for conflict, as if this is merely a backdrop, a location, an arena for the ambitions of others”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister said no one should dismiss “the agency and ambition of a majority of the world’s population and the engine room of the global economy” or see the future of the region as a “foregone conclusion”. He drew parallels to “flawed” and “complacent” assumptions after the cold war that globalisation and free trade would create a more open, stable world. Albanese pointed to “the rise of nativism and isolationism” and “the biggest conventional military build-up since the second world war” – the latter referring to China. But he said the fate of the Indo-Pacific was “not preordained”. “To move from imagining conflict is impossible to assuming war is inevitable is just as harmful to our shared goals,” he said. Albanese sought to reassure south-east Asia that his government sees the region in positive terms, not just as a venue for geopolitical rivalry. “I can assure you that when Australia looks north, we don’t see a void for others to impose their will,” he said. “We see a community of nations whose actions and decisions are essential to building prosperity and preserving peace in the Indo-Pacific.” Albanese also said the citizens of the region had shown “an unflinching commitment” to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. He described such weapons as “destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate” and called for cooperative action to “drive disarmament”. Backing the concept of “guardrails” to manage tensions between the US and China, Albanese said Australia strongly supported the Biden administration’s push to establish “reliable and open channels of communication” with Beijing. “This isn’t about a policy of containment; it’s not a question of placing obstacles in the way of any nation’s progress or potential,” he said. “This is a matter of simple, practical structures to prevent a worst-case scenario.” He said despite a difference of “worldviews” and “values”, Australia was placing dialogue at the heart of its efforts to stabilise relations with China. “Because the alternative – the silence of the diplomatic deep freeze – only breeds suspicion, only makes it easier for nations to attribute motive to misunderstanding, to assume the worst of one another,” Albanese said. Albanese urged China to remove “impediments” to trade with Australia. The federal opposition has backed dialogue with China but has started to question whether it is leading to tangible outcomes. The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, told ABC Radio National on Friday that China was “continuing to impose punishment and coercion upon Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T09:56:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 474 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s armed forces have claimed to have liberated several frontline villages in western Donetsk, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit’s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, Kyiv said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on Monday morning. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and further south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank The Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all “volunteer units” should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a photoshopped image to Telegram which shows Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. Three civilians were killed Sunday and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt at the weekend to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T14:21:41Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2022 power rankings: how the remaining eight teams shape up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","fields":{"bodyText":"The Seleção are in full flight and, as you may have heard, enjoying themselves in the process. Their first-half evisceration of South Korea felt like a throwback, moments such as Richarlison’s seal impression offering reminders of those days when nobody could rival Brazil for sheer fun. Even without Gabriel Jesus they retain a depth of attacking talent few can match, partly thanks to Neymar’s Lazarus-like recovery from injury. Keep this up and a first World Cup since 2002 should be theirs, although there are caveats: they squeaked past Switzerland, the only practised tournament side they have faced, and Croatia should offer an even sterner test on Friday. Alisson Becker was also worked harder than he may have liked on Monday night, although he demonstrated the value of a top-class keeper in the process. Can anyone stop them? Sometimes it feels France’s plan is to send possession Kylian Mbappé’s way and say: “You do the rest.” The problem for their opponents is that it tends to work. Anyone who can halt Mbappé may be able to stop Les Bleus but he is in virtually unplayable form and already looks a safe bet for the Golden Boot. Didier Deschamps will also be encouraged that the supporting cast is showing signs of life and France, who have scored nine goals across the three games in which he has selected a first-choice side, may be clicking at the right time. The evergreen Olivier Giroud adds a valuable balance while Aurélien Tchouaméni has taken to life as their midfield linchpin. Further injuries would give Deschamps a headache but the core look in lean shape. That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Now that Fernando Santos has, perhaps terminally, cut the cord with Cristiano Ronaldo the tournament seems alive with possibility for Portugal. They were devastating against Switzerland, a rejuvenated frontline slicing their unusually loose opponents open at will and Gonçalo Ramos coming from nowhere to become a potential star of this winter. Beating decent Ghana and Uruguay sides in the group stage was further evidence of the weapons Santos has in his armoury, which include a potent substitute in Rafael Leão. They will not be devastated at facing Morocco on Saturday, who spent 120 minutes on a highly rewarding but hugely exacting task in defeating Spain. Could Ronaldo’s much-sought World Cup be won from the sidelines? Gareth Southgate’s players will find France a clear step up from several lower-key assignments but it would not take an over-active imagination to see them pull through on Saturday. There were rocky moments early on against Senegal but England have some of the best young players in the tournament – Jude Bellingham has announced himself as an essential pick – and are a gripping proposition when on the front foot. When they are denied space, much of their possession can appear sterile: France will know that and may be content to utilise their own speed through counterattacks. But Harry Kane has opened his account, the midfield looks well-balanced and defensive bloopers have been minimised: could it be coming home for Christmas? Every Argentina match in Doha feels like appointment viewing, if not for the fare produced by Lionel Scaloni’s team then for the jaw-dropping support that turns stadiums into pulsating places of worship. La Albiceleste have only shone in flashes but have done well to banish that remarkable defeat by Saudi Arabia, and one thing is clear: Lionel Messi is already enjoying his best World Cup, scoring three times and operating on a different level to everyone else. There are signs his younger teammates are raising theirs: Julián Álvarez is showing why Manchester City brought him to the Etihad and the Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández looks an outstanding talent. They still need to put it together against the best but with supporters that make it feel like they have home advantage, Argentina have a chance. There is a sense Louis van Gaal’s team has flown beneath the radar so far but, like others, they are stirring at a convenient point. Critics accused them of boring football during an unremarkable group stage but Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo – the latter was certainly exempt from criticism in earlier games – shone against the USA and Denzel Dumfries was outstanding at right wing-back. Frenkie de Jong was also back to his best and their tie with Argentina, a reprise of previous classics, looks finely poised. The Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 games since Van Gaal’s return and, while he would still like greater control in possession, can be rapier-like in the transition. If Messi is to land the biggest prize, he has a stiff hurdle to overcome on Friday. Morocco showed in the group stage that they are a serious team and everyone is awake to that now after they dumped Spain out. Walid Regragui oversees a tough, clever unit with extraordinary tactical discipline and an attack capable of the unexpected. The only goal they have conceded was a consolation in the win over Canada and that is some achievement given they have played Croatia, Belgium and Spain. Shutting out Portugal on Saturday would top the lot and Morocco have a chance. In Achraf Hakimi they possess a genuine star, while Luis Enrique can testify to the qualities of the midfield whirlwind, Azzedine Ounahi. And nobody can discount a flash of genius from Hakim Ziyech. Africa has never had a representative in the last four and Morocco are a win away from making history. You know the old saying: never write off the Croatians. In all seriousness, Zlatko Dalic’s team have a whiff of past Germany sides about them: they never know when they are beaten and, while they are creaking in some departments, few know their way around a tournament more adeptly. They were on the ropes against a sparky Japan but pulled through; Ivan Perisic’s equaliser was a reminder that half this squad still boasts several World Cup finalists and that counts for plenty when fine margins need navigating. Whether they can handle Brazil’s attacking tempo remains to be seen but it would be foolhardy to rule them out on Friday. One way or another, Croatia have a habit of making you play on their terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK homes can become virtual power plants to avoid outages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","fields":{"bodyText":"This month we published our analysis of the British electricity system this winter. Our message is clear: in the base case our analysis indicates that supply margins are expected to be adequate, however this winter will undoubtedly be challenging. Therefore, all of us in the electricity system operator (ESO) are working round the clock to manage the system, ensure the flow of energy and do our bit to keep costs down for consumers. One of the tools we have developed is the demand flexibility service. From November, this new capability will reward homes and businesses for shifting their electricity consumption at peak times. And we are working with the government, businesses and energy providers to encourage as high a level of take-up as possible. We are confident this innovative approach can provide at least 2 gigawatts of power – about a million homes’ worth. What began as an initiative to help achieve net zero and keep costs down is also proving to be an important tool in ensuring Britain’s energy security. We are particularly keen to get businesses involved right across Britain. When the Guardian first reported on this service we had calls from businesses ranging from multinationals to an owner of a fish and chip shop asking how they could do their bit and get signed up. We can now confirm our proposals for how much people and businesses can be paid for shifting their electricity use outside peak times. We anticipate paying a rate of £3,000 per megawatt hour. Businesses and homes can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too. For a consumer that could mean a typical household could save approximately £100, and industrial and commercial businesses with larger energy usage could save multiples of this. We are working with Ofgem to get this scheme launched in November and for it to be rolled out through energy suppliers. If you are interested in participating, or understanding what you could get paid, please contact your energy supplier. Innovations such as these have never mattered more. Vladimir Putin’s unlawful aggression means we are facing unprecedented energy market volatility and pressures on energy supplies this winter. As a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine, European gas is scarce and prices are high. Alongside this, France’s nuclear fleet has experienced a higher number of outages than expected. Energy shortages in Europe could have knock-on implications for energy supply in Britain. We have put in place additional contingency arrangements for this winter. For example, the ability to call on generators to fire-up emergency coal units, giving Britain 2GW of additional capacity. We need to be clear, it is possible that without these measures supply could be interrupted for some customers for limited periods of time. This could eventually force us to initiate a temporary rota of planned electricity outages, meaning that some customers could be without power for up to three hours at a time through a process called the electricity supply emergency code (ESEC). Under the ESEC process we would advise the public the day before any disconnections. We are working with government and industry on planning for this so that the message can be spread across all communities as quickly and accurately as possible. This would include press conferences, social media campaigns, and working with influencers in different communities. That’s the worst-case scenario, which our analysis tells us is unlikely to become a reality. Our base case is that security of supply margins will be adequate through the winter. We will do everything in our power to mitigate and minimise any risks to Britain’s security of supply. We are better placed than our neighbours on the continent to respond because Britain already has one of the cleanest, most reliable electricity systems in the world. Long-term, maintaining this lead will help guarantee our energy security and keep costs down. • Fintan Slye is the director of National Grid’s electricity system operator"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-03T15:32:03Z","webTitle":"Whatever the truth behind allegations against Lizzo, women can certainly be abusers, too | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","fields":{"bodyText":"Being an icon, the rapper-singer-songwriter Lizzo once said, is not about how long you’ve had your platform. Instead it’s about “what you do with that platform”, as she told a cheering crowd at last year’s People’s Choice awards in the US, before inviting a string of female activists who she suggested were more deserving of recognition to join her on stage. Few seemingly embodied inclusive feminism better than Lizzo, who built her brand on an uplifting, joyful, thrillingly body-positive form of female empowerment while glorying in her sexuality as a self-styled “big grrrl”. Of course it’s her bouncy, summery track Pink that plays over the opening scenes of the new Barbie film. Who better than Lizzo to sell the idea of a dreamworld ruled by women for women, where men are just Kens and benign rule by Barbies frees all their sisters to be whatever they want to be? How depressing, then, that the very same Lizzo should now find herself accused – along with her production company and dance captain Shirlene Quigley – of creating the very opposite of a dreamworld for women behind closed doors. Three of her former tour dancers have filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles claiming they were “exposed to an overtly sexual atmosphere that permeated their workplace”, effectively amounting to sexual harassment. Quigley is accused of pushing her Christian views on the dancers, denigrating those who had premarital sex, and Lizzo of pressuring one of the dancers to intimately touch a nude performer in an Amsterdam club, a story that sounds as if it could have come straight from some 1990s horror story of City women forced into a leering boys’ trip to Stringfellows. The same dancer, Arianna Davis, also alleges she felt fat-shamed for her weight on a tour explicitly celebrating full-figured women. On Thursday Lizzo hit back hard at what she called “sensationalised stories” from former employees who, she alleged, behaved unprofessionally on tour, writing on her Instagram account: “Usually I choose not to respond to false allegations but these are as unbelievable as they sound and too outrageous to not be addressed.” The vitriol poured over her on social media, meanwhile, suggests some are enjoying trashing a loud, proud, joyously big black woman for all the wrong reasons. But while the truth of these particular allegations will presumably now be settled only in court, there’s a cautionary tale here about female empowerment that transcends one artist. The idea that any female boss could be as capable as a male one of making employees’ lives miserable, or even of sexual harassment, shouldn’t surprise us as much as it invariably does. Sisters are not always sisterly and nor are women somehow innately nice. (I still remember the former colleague shocked to be asked directly whether she planned to get pregnant any time soon, in a job interview conducted by a groundbreaking senior woman; I remember, too, the doughty feminist campaigner whose young female underlings seemed visibly terrified of her.) Sexual harassment by women, meanwhile, may be rare but it’s not nonexistent. At the height of #MeToo, when the Westminster whisper network started sharing stories about allegedly inappropriate behaviour by MPs, a sprinkling of female names was thrown in to an admittedly much larger pot of male ones who reportedly made junior staff feel uncomfortable. For whatever reason, those particular whispers never saw the light of day. Perhaps men worried that if they reported it they’d be ridiculed, or told they should be able to handle a clumsy sexual overture or remark from a woman half their size. But anyone can be afraid of the professional consequences of rejecting the boss. Anyone can be made to feel humiliated, or anxious about coming in to work because of what they’ll have to pretend they are comfortable with. And women, of course, can also be sexually harassed by women. Yet the possibility still rarely enters into our assumptions, even now. The current Commons women and equalities select committee inquiry into misogyny in the music industry has heard some shocking stories about life in a precarious freelance world where crew members feared they’d never work again if they complained about a big star’s behaviour. But what’s striking, reading through the evidence transcripts, is how many witnesses and MPs alike talked about tackling misogyny by hiring more female executives or signing more female artists. It is ingrained in us to see men as the problem and women as the answer, no doubt because so often that is how it pans out. But anyone can behave badly given half a chance, especially in the kind of toxic, high-pressure environments where people with power are indulged in abusing it, so long as they’re getting results. Harassment is ultimately an abuse of power, and these days power doesn’t always lie where it did. Countless women, me included, can point to female bosses who made their working lives easier. But plonking one woman on a golden pedestal fixes nothing by itself. It’s not enough for one Barbie to preside over a make-believe world of female empowerment, while in the real world the same old assumptions and commercial pressures create the conditions under which some women thrive and others mysteriously don’t. And there’s nothing particularly positive, either, about a sexuality that rides roughshod over other people’s boundaries. The only power that really counts, at work or in private life but perhaps especially in the kind of jobs that disingenuously blur the two, is the power to say no to something personally uncomfortable without having to live in fear of the consequences.

But the universe – or, more accurately, a unique combination of bad luck and stupid decisions – had conspired against me, leaving me with no phone, no internet, no power, no money and nothing to do but tend to my overgrown garden. I am known to be a forgetful person. Among things I have lost are keys, wallets, bike locks, prized jewellery, hats (many, many hats), jackets, library books and credit cards. So it didn’t exactly bowl me down with surprise when I awoke on a Saturday morning to the realisation that at some point between a gig, an Uber ride and a late-night board game, my iPhone had gone missing. This was the fifth phone I had lost (four domestically, one at a Rastafarian bar in the northern foothills of Thailand). As such, I’ve become accustomed to periods of accidentally enforced phone withdrawals, and don’t consider myself a social media junkie. I took the temporary loss of my connection to the outside world in my stride, spending Saturday cooking with my housemate and wandering the park with my dog. I even found myself thinking with some sense of humble reverence how nice it was to “switch off” for a moment and appreciate the little things – a child playing with their mother, a community sausage sizzle, my dog bounding across an oval with his tongue lolling out. What I didn’t expect was waking up on day two without a phone to a major power outage, courtesy of an ancient house with old wiring and a bucketload of rain overnight. Suddenly, my other technological devices were rendered useless. How was I supposed to idly scroll Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on my laptop? How was I supposed to stream bad reality tv on Netflix? How was I supposed to Google random things – like the last time Carlton was in a grand final with Collingwood (1988), or the price of Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina candle (approximately $100)? Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads As a millennial, I straddle the divide between dial-up internet and the explosion of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. I still remember getting my first mobile as a prepubescent child - a red flip-phone that I adorned with gems and used primarily to play the retro Nokia game Snake. Even in those days, technology was rife in my life, from my Nintendo DS to nights on MSN and Club Penguin (if you know, you know). Now, I had found myself in a Survivor-esque situation, or something like one of those shows where they send families back to the 1800s in Victorian-era clothing. To make matters worse, my bank card had been missing for about a week, tucked in a rarely used bag or jacket, I had assumed, and I’d been relying on my phone’s digital wallet to pay for everything in my life. And I’d allow my car to run almost completely out of petrol. So here I was, a Rapunzel locked in my tower as the contents of our fridge slowly warmed to room temperature and rain pooled into mud-piles in the yard. But I could do this! Nay, my housemates and I could do this! We set to work, sticking a candle into one of the previous night’s empty wine bottles and positioning it in the toilet so nobody would be required to poo in the dark. Gazing at the flickering wick, burning softly by toilet paper rolls, and the slow trickle of water from our semi-broken latrine, it almost looked like a highly valuable modern art installation. “The Fountain of Youth,” a housemate whispered. For the first hour, I was determined to make the most of a bad situation. I began a 1,000 piece puzzle, completed the edges and read the newspaper from front to back. I cleaned the house, emptied the bins and brushed my dog. By hour three, I had begun vacantly roaming the halls, dreaming of the adrenaline hit of a Twitter notification or an Instagram like. The world could literally have entered into nuclear war, I thought, and I wouldn’t know. By hour five, I had lost it. Distraction – I needed it desperately. My dog and the house were pristine. There was no other option. I grabbed a pair of shears and boots and hit the front yard. Sopping wet, with a slightly mad look in my eye, I hacked away, as dog-walkers walked by with umbrellas and telephones and, probably, working power-points. The universe had tested me, and I had proven it right. I went to bed. That night, with the power finally restored courtesy of a very kind electrician who mysteriously went by “Mr White”, my housemates and I sat in the kitchen and completed the puzzle together by lamplight. We barely spoke but for the slotting of a tricky piece, when we’d cry out in exultation. We were too focused. I didn’t think of my phone once."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","fields":{"bodyText":"The government’s latest budget will do little to meet the UK’s net zero carbon goals, missed opportunities to create a green economy, and would saddle households with high energy bills driven by fossil fuel prices, green campaigners and experts have said. Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T06:06:16Z","webTitle":"Auckland at a standstill as storm leaves thousands in North Island without power – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/feb/13/cyclone-gabrielle-new-zealand-regional-states-of-emergency-evacuation-declared-auckland-as-storm-approaches","fields":{"bodyText":"Before we close down our live blog, here is a quick summary of today’s developments. You can also read our full report by our New Zealand correspondent, Tess McClure. Gabrielle is currently sitting 250km (155 miles) north-west of New Zealand’s coast and is forecast to move close to the east coast over the next 24 hours. Thousands of homes across the country are currently without power. Electricity is out for 46,000 homes, cell service is patchy in some areas and trees have come down and roofs lifted off. The emergency management minister, Kieran McAnulty, said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Almost all of the top half of the North Island has been covered by localised states of emergency including in Auckland – New Zealand’s largest city of 1.7 million people – as well as in Northland, Coromandel, Ōpōtiki, Whakatāne, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki. Communities in coastal regions evacuated on Monday. Mandatory evacuations were ordered along the entire eastern Bay of Plenty coastline – an area covering about 400 homes – as well as for 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region. There were concerns that the high tide – due to arrive around midnight on Monday – would coincide with the worst of the storm. National forecaster MetService said it had broken its record for “red” weather warnings issued around the country, and wind gusts of 150-160km/h were recorded. New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins warned the worst is yet to come as Cyclone Gabrielle sparks evacuations, rising flood waters and power outages across the North Island. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better,” Hipkins said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event.” Hipkins added that the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” as of 4pm on Monday but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. The New Zealand government announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. Air New Zealand cancelled 509 flights with 10,000 international customers affected by the disruptions. Normal services are expected to resume on Tuesday. The cyclone is the second significant weather event to hit Auckland and the upper North Island in just a few weeks. Last month Auckland and surrounding areas were hit by record rainfall that sparked floods and killed four people. A landslide crashed into a home in a coastal Coromandel Peninsula town, forcing its occupants to evacuate on Monday afternoon. Fire and emergency crews were alerted to the large slip in Hahei at 4.18pm on Monday, local news outlet Stuff reported. “From the information we can see, everyone is out of the house and a small number of people in the area are being evacuated,” a spokesperson said. “That’s as much detail as we can provide.” A “record storm surge” has been recorded in Whitianga, in the Waikato region of New Zealand’s North Island. The Whitianga monitoring station recorded a storm surge of 0.7 metres and rising, according to the Niwa forecast service. The surge measures the rise in water level above the normal tidal level. Rain engulfs North Island Radar images released by MetService show rain engulfing New Zealand’s North Island on Monday afternoon. Eight North Island regions have now declared states of emergency. Here are some of the latest images to come through our news wires this afternoon. Here Hauraki and Ōpōtiki have also announced local states of emergency – that’s most of the upper North Island now covered. At his 4pm press conference, prime minister Chris Hipkins said the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. Waikato District Council has declared a local state of emergency, saying a number of areas around the Waikato River were now at high risk of flooding. At least five other North Island regions – Auckland, Whakatāne, Northland, Coromandel and Tairāwhiti – have declared local states of emergency, which allow councils special powers, including to conduct emergency evacuations. “With the worst of the weather due to hit overnight, we want to ensure that we are ready to respond taking whatever action necessary to keep our people safe,” said the Waikato District Council mayor, Jacqui Church. She also told residents to self-evacuate if their area was flooding. If there is surface flooding in your area and you see rising water, do not wait for official warnings. Head for higher ground and stay away from flood water. Storm reflects global importance of tackling climate crisis, Hipkins says The prime minister says that he’ll likely discuss recent weather emergencies in upcoming meetings with other world leaders – and that the storms illustrate the “global importance” of tackling climate change. I think we’re certainly bound to be asked about the weather in my discussions with other leaders... I’ll be sharing New Zealand’s experience and of course, it is an illustration of the global importance of tackling the challenge of climate change. Other countries are experiencing more extreme weather events as well – the globe is increasingly seeing the effects of climate change. Hipkins has spent some time discussing the government’s $11.5m in extra funding for cyclone relief. “It’s clear the demand for support is exceeding the funding available,” he said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better.” The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is speaking to media now from Auckland. He says 25,000 people have so far been assisted with food, clothing, shelter, bedding and accommodation. “People have lost their homes and their vehicles, families are facing additional challenges getting children back to school. And many families will be facing anxiety and distress,” he said. The New Zealand government has just announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. The minister for social development and employment, Carmel Sepuloni, said that the demand for support is exceeding funding available for community organisations and groups. Under the proposed support package, $4m will be given to providers to ensure they can “meet increased demand and support [the] wellbeing of their staff and volunteers” as well as $1m to replenish stocks at food banks currently experiencing high demand, according to a ministry statement shared with the Guardian. Another $2m of grants will be provided for community groups to support flood response and a $4m expansion of the scope of community connectors to support Auckland and impacted regions’ flood response efforts. A $500,000 ring fenced funding will also be included to respond to the needs of disabled people. Sepuloni said: This support package will provide immediate relief for individuals and families, bespoke support for disabled people like transport assistance, as well as support for the voluntary sector who continue to be at the heart of their communities and our response.” Sepuloni added that although “we’re not out of the woods yet” and the full extent of the damage was still unfolding, he said authorities needed to act swiftly to ensure people can continue to access support. “Our focus remains on the most affected communities including Māori, Pacific, disabled, youth and our ethnic communities, and the organisations and groups that work to support them,” he added. A mandatory evacuation order is currently in place for about 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region, which just declared a local state of emergency at 3pm on Monday. Acting mayor Lesley Immink said the declaration provides additional emergency management powers to the district controller and enables the civil defence response to call on support from outside the district if required. Emergency management powers allows our response team to do things like close off areas, evacuate people and get the resources needed to respond to this event. Auckland airport has also released an update, advising that there have been “significant flight cancellations” today. A total of 85 out of 104 scheduled international flights have been cancelled together with all 301 scheduled domestic flights, the airport said. Cyclone Gabrielle is approaching New Zealand’s North Island as more challenging conditions are set to come. Our video team has gathered some of the footage from the past few hours. The weather has also wreaked havoc on New Zealand’s travel network, with flights, trains and bus schedules all badly affected. Air New Zealand said they had so far cancelled 509 flights, but normal services were expected to resume on Tuesday. The airline said 10,000 international customers were disrupted, with 6,500 left to be rebooked. “With over 500 flight cancellations impacting more than 29,000 customers, we’re doing everything we can to get those disrupted back into the skies as quickly as possible,” the airline said in a statement on Monday afternoon. Thousands of homes in New Zealand are currently without power and flights have been grounded. Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Although the storm has weakened from its previous cyclone status, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines. A state of emergency has been declared in five northern regions including Auckland. Some 58,000 people in New Zealand’s North Island are without power. Officials warn it could take days to restore the network. “As long as the weather continues to be as severe as it is, it’s actually unsafe” to work on the network, McAnulty said. Another quick snap here from MetService showing strong winds expected across the majority of the country. In northern New Zealand, some of the highest gusts have been recorded. The forecaster recorded winds of up to 163km/h at Channel Island and 144 km/h at Mokohinau Island. National forecaster MetService has issued a heavy rain warning, together with a red and strong wind warning predicted to last until Wednesday. Wind gusts of 150-160 km/h, and some stations in Gisborne have recorded rain rates of 15-30mm in a single hour, the forecaster said. Wind gusts also reached up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. These winds are expected to produce widespread damage, especially to trees and power lines and could lift roofs. Transport and power networks are likely to be significantly impacted, with road closures and power outages. Conditions will be hazardous for motorists and there is a danger to life from flying debris and falling trees or branches. Emergency services log 198 weather-related incidents Fire and Emergency New Zealand district manager Brad Mosby has also provided an update, saying that said over the past 12 hours, from 1am, there had been 198 incidents logged related to severe weather. Most have been related to wind damage, he added. There were 91 incidents recorded in Northland, 62 in Auckland and 35 in Waikato, mainly from the Coromandel. As rain intensifies, more calls relating to flooding are coming through, Moseby said. Worst of wind to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday MetService meteorologist Georgina Griffiths has said the cyclone is about halfway through and the most challenging wind conditions are set to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday. Griffiths said rainfall has made the ground soggy again, however no major flooding has happened yet. We do not expect everyone to see the heavier rain rates, however those who do will see localised impacts such as slips and floods. The wind is expected to return from the south-west overnight and tomorrow. A storm surge is still likely for eastern Auckland around 2am, however effects will be less than previously expected, Griffiths said. ‘We’re not out of the woods yet,’ Auckland residents warned Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, has said the effects of the cyclone will get worse before they get better. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” she told reporters during a live briefing on Monday. Auckland residents urged to stay home The mayor of Auckland, Wayne Brown, has said the next 24 hours will be challenging, urging residents to stay home. As long as it’s safe, stay home … It’s going to be a hard night and a very difficult week. For many, the recovery will be long.” Officials are gathering to provide a live update on Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland today. Representatives from the MetService, Auckland council, the NZDF, fire and emergency and other organisations are joining Auckland emergency management at 2pm local time. Speaking are Georgina Griffiths from MetService, Colonel Mel Childs from the defence force, fire and emergency district manager Brad Mosby, Vector’s chief operating officer Peter Ryan, Auckland mayor Wayne Brown and Auckland transport’s general manager of safety, Stacey van der Putten. We will bring you all the latest lines shortly. Defence force on standby The New Zealand defence force has located 150 staff across Auckland and neighbouring regions as they bring in welfare supplies to civil defence centres and shelters. A statement issued by the force on Monday morning read: About 150 NZDF personnel and mix of vehicle types are positioned ready to respond across the Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and Bay of Plenty areas. Teams have also been assisting in the establishment of Civil Defence centres and shelters across Auckland including delivering more than 50 pallets of emergency supplies including blankets, tea, coffee, air mattresses, sleeping bags and warm clothes. Rain and wind expected to intensify The approach of Cyclone Gabrielle is bringing particularly strong winds, heavy rain and huge swells to Auckland and nearby regions. Gabrielle is now sitting just north of New Zealand, with weather forecasters expecting rain and winds to intensify as it nears land during Monday and Tuesday. Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, warned that the cyclone was “still in its early stages” and more severe weather is to come. The impact of Gabrielle is still in its early stages and further serious and severe weather is still expected for Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) later today into Tuesday morning. Now is not the time for complacency. Person missing on boat off Great Barrier Island A search is under way to for a person missing on a boat off the coast of Great Barrier Island. A police spokesperson said police had responded to reports of a boat in distress around 2.15am. “Enquiries are ongoing to locate one person aboard a water vessel near Great Barrier Island this morning.” The Police Maritime and Eagle – helicopter response – units had “attempted to approach the boat throughout the morning, however conditions have been challenging, and at this stage no one has been located,” they said. Police will make further attempts to approach the vessel when conditions allow. Chris Hipkins may miss opening of parliament Prime minister Chris Hipkins may miss the scheduled opening of parliament tomorrow if he remains trapped in Auckland by Cyclone Gabrielle. Hipkins traveled to Auckland to attend cyclone preparation briefings and speak to Apec business council. With all domestic flights in and out of Auckland currently cancelled until at least midday tomorrow, the prime minister’s chances of getting back to parliament to deliver the prime minister’s statement – traditional on the first house sitting of the year – are looking narrow. Cellphone service disrupted by storm As well as power outages, there are disruptions to cellphone coverage – primarily in the upper North Island – with some cell phone sites out due to power outages or wind damage. Vodafone, Spark and 2 Degrees all say they have a number of sites down. Forecasters and weather monitoring agencies are forecasting huge swells around the North Island – and warning people to stay away. National forecaster Metservice says the worst weather is still to come – and that it has already broken records for the most “red” weather warnings ever issued. Some of the key points from their statement at noon: Cyclone Gabrielle is bearing down on the North Island, and despite widespread damage and disruption last night and this morning, the worst weather is still to come for many regions today. “This is a major weather system and shouldn’t be taken lightly,” explains meteorologist Angus Hines. “We have a couple more days of wild weather ahead. We’ve never had such an extensive range of Red Severe Weather Warnings – which are the highest classification of Severe Weather Warning MetService can issue.” Many of the red rain warnings are for already waterlogged regions, following last month’s floods. Those warnings are currently in place for Northland, Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula and the north of Tairāwhiti/Gisborne. Angus says: All of these places have already dealt with immense rainfall this year, and lots of them are in clean-up mode from recent flooding. Unfortunately, we expect further flooding, slips power outages, and road closures Monday and Tuesday, prolonging this unprecedented wet summer. Evacuations advised in some low-lying, coastal communities Evacuations are under way in some coastal, low-lying and river-adjacent communities. In Whangarei, the district council has advised residents living close to rivers in the central business district and Town Basin area to evacuate before high tide at 1.56pm, “because of a high risk of coastal flooding”. An evacuation centre has opened at McKay Stadium. Elsewhere around the North Island, some communities have been self-evacuating, but officials don’t yet have data on how many. At an 11am press conference, emergency management official Roger Ball said there was no precise number of evacuations at that point. Twenty-four Civil Defence centres and shelters opened up in Auckland overnight, including three mass evacuation centres. New Zealanders are advised to check with their local Civil Defence for details on evacuations. Cyclone tracking southward So far the centre of the cyclone is sitting just north of New Zealand, and moving slowly southward. Here’s a satellite image from an hour ago: You can track the cyclone via satellite in real time via Metservice. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Cyclone Gabrielle. I’m Tess McClure, I’m based in Auckland, and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they come in. Here is what we know so far: 58,000 homes in the North Island are without power, and some in the Northland region may not have it restored for around a week. Auckland, Northland, Coromandel and the Tairāwhiti region have declared states of emergency. As of 11am, government officials said they were assessing every four hours whether a national state of emergency would be declared. Evacuations have begun in some low-lying and coastal communities. The cyclone has not yet made landfall, and the worst of the storm’s effects are yet to arrive, emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said on Monday morning: “Today is the critical day in the event with a highly dangerous combination of high winds and heavy rain.” National forecaster MetService has issued 30 weather warnings nationwide, with “red” weather and rain warnings for Auckland and Northland. Wind gusts have reaches up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. Auckland residents have been urged to stay home and ensure they have supplies for up to three days. Most Auckland flights and all trains are cancelled and almost every school is shut. The cyclone comes a fortnight after devastating floods in Auckland and around the North Island, which killed four, damaged thousands of homes and left 370 households still in emergency accommodation. The severe winds and rain would come on top of already sodden land, risking structural problems, landslips, falling trees and power line problems. The whole Auckland region was at risk of flooding, emergency management officials said on Monday. Minister urges people urged to hunker down Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty has just finished up a briefing in Auckland, urging people to finalise their preparations and then hunker down. “To those where the weather hasn’t hit but it’s projected to, please use the time that you’ve got to get prepared. As we’ve seen in those areas that have now been hit, using that time to get prepared can make all the difference.” Some supermarkets have run out of high-demand items, but he said those shortages would be temporary, and told people to resist panic buying. “We’re encouraging people to … only get what they need. In an event like this three days should be enough.” He ended by urging against unnecessary risk-taking – including surfers who could be tempted by huge swells. Please don’t go out in the flood water, please don’t go out in the high swells. We’re seeing reports and projections that some of the swells around coastal New Zealand are going to be absolutely massive – look, I’m conscious that some people might find that appealing and they might want to go surfing or whatever … please don’t do something that if you get caught will drag emergency responders away from their core task."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T03:00:07Z","webTitle":"Selfies, sendoffs and star power as Jacinda Ardern has her last day in the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","fields":{"bodyText":"From the moment of her arrival, Jacinda Ardern is surrounded by a crush of people: hundreds gather to ask for final selfies, record video messages for friends and relatives, or simply watch her pass by. A group of running children weaves through bystanders’ legs, pushing for a better view. Over and over, she obliges, smiling for cameraphones, asking people’s names and jobs, cracking jokes, signing a worn blue and yellow basketball for a boy who pushes through the crowd. A politician who always excelled at creating moments of humour and human connection, Ardern’s much-discussed star power was firmly on display in the North Island village of Rātana on Tuesday for her last formal engagement as the prime minister of New Zealand. “It’s like, ‘touch her cloak, touch her cloak like Jesus’,” a woman laughs to her friend. “Where is she? Is she coming?” a girl asked, craning for a glimpse. “I just want to tell her thank you,” a woman outside the Rātana temple tells a policeman standing nearby. “For everything.” One man spends a minute vigorously and continuously shaking her hand. “You’re going to have to let go at some point,” an onlooker remarks, and the crowd laughs. New Zealand – and the world – is still reckoning with Ardern’s shock departure, the whirlwind selection of her replacement, and the question of how to define her political legacy. On her final full day as the country’s leader, however, some of the thornier and more controversial questions of her political legacy and legislative record seemed to fade into the background. *** Rātana traditionally marks the beginning of New Zealand’s political year, with party leaders descending on the village to give their first major speeches after the summer break. This year was different, it also marked the ending of an era. The scenes recalled some of the electric fandom Ardern provoked when she first took the leadership in 2017 – greeted by scrums of hopeful selfie-takers and fans. Five years of difficult decisions and political struggles had worn much of that glitter away, particularly in the polls, where voters had punished the prime minister and her party for a year of economic headwinds. But on Tuesday, the shine was back on. A few metres away, the incoming prime minister Chris Hipkins stands in a circle of reporters, answering questions – for the most part, the crowd doesn’t look his way. There was no sign on Tuesday of the small, furious knot of protesters who had become an increasingly recurrent presence at Ardern’s public appearances – sometimes bearing signs and anti-vaccine slogans, other times chasing her van and screaming obscenities. Ardern has said threats and abuse were not contributing factors to her resignation, but her departure has still prompted the start of an uncomfortable reckoning in New Zealand with the scope and volume of misogynistic, violent rhetoric, abuse and threats channelled the leader’s way. Speaking briefly to reporters, she said that her enduring experience of the job had been positive. “I would hate for anyone to view my departure as a negative commentary on New Zealand,” she said. “I have experienced such love, compassion, empathy and kindness in the job. That has been my predominant experience. So I leave feeling gratitude for having this wonderful role for so many years … My only words are words of thanks.” *** As they waited for the prime minister, tribal elders and politicians sheltered in plastic marquees from the blast of late-summer sun. The grass lining the roads to the marae (meeting place) has grown long and parched, worn down to fibre by the summer heat and signalling a season winding down. As her tenure ends, the question of Ardern’s ongoing influence on the direction and tone of New Zealand politics remains open. Even before she arrived at Rātana’s borders, the figure of Ardern loomed large over the political speeches of the day. Centre-right opposition leader Christopher Luxon made no explicit mention of the prime minister, but chose to speak about his vision of the “kindness politics” that she ushered in. We will “demonstrate kindness, demonstrate that we care, through careful stewardship of the economy”, he said – a choice of framing that seemed only to illustrate the degree to which Ardern had come to determine the language and frames of reference of New Zealand’s political conversation. Most of the leaders paid their tributes more overtly. “You were the captain calling the shots on the waka [canoe] that navigated us through truly tough times,” said Rahui Papa, a leader within the Tainui and Māori king movements. “You were the right person to lead our nation through terrible times,” said Che Wilson, previous president of the Māori party. “I wear my political allegiances here,” he said, pointing to the Indigenous designs patterning his attire, “but prime minister, it is only right that we say thank you,” he said, as the crowd erupted into applause. Asked if she had a parting word for the public, the prime minister said she would not be disappearing entirely. “You will see me out and about, but you won’t see me in the centre, in the cut and thrust of politics,” she said. On whether she would miss that, Ardern replied simply: “I’m going to miss people. Because that’s been the joy of the job.” *** The celebrations at Rātana are an appropriate final bookend for Ardern’s term. In 2018 – just two months into her prime ministership and a few days after her pregnancy with daughter Neve was announced – she appeared at Rātana. That year, Rātana elders offered her a Māori middle name for her child: Waru, a sacred number for the church. Over the years that followed, the gathering has marked milestones and moments of Ardern’s tenure as a leader – and watched her family grow up, with Neve occasionally making appearances to toddle through the crowds, chased by security guards. In a final, brief standup for reporters, Ardern said it was spending more time in that role – as mother and family member – that she was looking forward to. “I’m ready to be lots of things,” she said. “I’m ready to be a backbench MP. I’m ready to be a sister, and a mum.” Then she turned, replaced her sunglasses, and walked away from the last cluster of microphones she would face as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T09:30:09Z","webTitle":"Anecdotal evidence has the power to change minds but facts are paramount | Torsten Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","fields":{"bodyText":"Welcoming good news is easy but it’s important to face up to bad news too, either to overcome it or quickly lower your expectations of life in line with it. On the face of it, beneath an encouraging headline, there’s some crushingly bad news for those of us working on rigorous, evidence-heavy research in a recent study that investigates which information changes the minds of people on the role of international aid spending, the efficacy of which many are sceptical about. The latter point in part explains why many countries are theoretically signed up to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid but most are doing no such thing. The chancellor’s autumn statement confirmed there was no imminent prospect of the UK returning to doing so. The researchers conducted an experiment to evaluate the impact of telling people (specifically 6,000 Germans) that an aid programme worked, by measuring its effect on their belief in aid effectiveness. The good news is that this was positive, raising average support by more than 10%. But, crucially, they also examined whether that impact is greater if it is backed up by different kinds of evidence: a serious chart illustrating the results of a scientific evaluation of the programme or a simple anecdote of someone who benefited endorsing the programme. Which kind of evidence had the biggest effect in boosting public support? The words no social scientist wants to read are: “anecdotal evidence performs best”. But all is not lost. After all, while some politicians may only worry about what convinces the public that they are right, researchers are also interested in what the truth is in the first place. And there evidence trumps anecdote every time. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that on Wednesday shelling in the Donetsk region killed two people and injured four others, while one person was killed and two were wounded in the Kherson region. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian ground forces, said “The aggressor does not give up hope of taking Bakhmut at any cost, despite the losses in manpower and equipment”. He added that Russia is losing “considerable strength” and that “very soon we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk”, all areas that Ukraine has previously liberated from Russian occupation. The UK Ministry of Defence said that “Russia has made gains of up to several kilometres” in the Luhansk region, and that “Russian commanders are likely trying to expand a security zone west from the defence lines they have prepared along higher ground, and integrate the natural obstacle of the Oskil River. They likely seek to recapture Kupiansk, a logistics node.” Any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin after the international criminal court (ICC) issued a warrant for the Kremlin chief would amount to a declaration of war against Russia, his ally Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday, while directly threatening to attack the seat of any government that allowed it to happen. A video is circulating on social media of the Ukrainian national flag flying from a tall mast in Crimea, a region annexed by Russia in 2014. It appears to have been filmed near the village of Hrushivka. Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez said on Thursday he would discuss a peace plan for Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping during an official visit to China next week. Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas on Thursday spoke against any weakening of sanctions against Russia under a deal to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and called for the G7 to tighten its oil cap to squeeze Russia’s revenue more. A former New Zealand soldier who drew an online following with his dispatches from the frontline of the Ukraine war has been killed. The death of Kane Te Tai, 38, was confirmed by New Zealand’s foreign ministry Thursday, citing Ukrainian government sources. Te Tai, who fought with the International Legion, is the third New Zealander known to have died in Ukraine. The UN nuclear agency’s chief said Wednesday that the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant “remains perilous” following a Russian missile strike this month that disconnected the plant from the grid. Europe’s largest nuclear power plant needs a reliable electricity supply to operate pumps that circulate water to cool reactors and pools holding nuclear fuel. Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia was a “journey of friendship, cooperation and peace”, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday, as China’s president ended his three-day visit to Moscow. Wang Wenbin reiterated Beijing’s claims that it remained neutral in the Ukraine conflict and said China would “continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukrainian issue”. Vladimir Putin has no immediate plans for peace in Ukraine, so the west needs to brace itself to supply lethal aid to Kyiv for a long time to come, Nato’s secretary general has warned in an interview with the Guardian. The fierce fighting, currently centred around Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, demonstrated Russia was willing “to just throw in thousands and thousands more troops, to take many casualties for minimal gains”, the head of Nato said. Russia’s foreign ministry has warned that Moscow will not leave “unanswered” a UK plan to supply Ukraine with tank shells made with depleted uranium. “This decision will not remain without serious consequences both for Russian-British bilateral relations and at the international level,” it said on Wednesday. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Britain’s decision took the situation to new and dangerous levels. The UK foreign secretary has said there is no “nuclear escalation” in the country’s decision to supply Ukraine with shells made with depleted uranium. “They are not nuclear munitions. They are purely conventional munitions,” James Cleverly said, a day after Vladimir Putin accused the west of “beginning to use weapons with a nuclear component”. The Prince of Wales travelled to Poland as part of a surprise two-day trip to Poland to thank British and Polish troops for their efforts supporting Ukraine, as well as to learn more about how the country has cared for displaced Ukrainian refugees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"Fresh effort to ban the bomb as new generation bids for nuclear-free world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/10/nuclear-disarmament-activists-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"As nuclear dangers gather momentum three decades after the cold war, a disarmament movement is rising to meet them, with a new generation of activists. In the late 50s and early 60s, and then again in the early 80s, when the US and the Soviet Union were pointing their missiles at each other in Europe, there were mass street protests against governments making plans for global annihilation. The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was born in the UK and staged large-scale marches to the heart of the British nuclear weapons establishment at Aldermaston. More than four decades ago, a million Americans converged on New York’s Central Park to call a halt to the arms race and a nuclear freeze. At the end of 1982, more than 30,000 women formed a human chain around the Greenham Common air force base as an act of resistance to the deployment of US cruise missiles there. In October 1983, CND staged the biggest march through London the city had ever seen. With Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and his repeated threats that he would use nuclear weapons if his regime felt in peril, the danger is every bit as real as it was during the Cuban missile crisis or the missile standoff in Europe. This time, there have not been any mass protests but there has been a popular response that has found other channels to express itself. At the vanguard of the new movement is the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), which successfully canvassed support for a Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) at the UN general assembly, leading to its adoption in 2017. Since then, more than 90 countries have signed the treaty and 68 have ratified it. It has not stopped the US and Russia from upgrading their arsenals and China from pursuing plans to become a third leading nuclear weapons power, but Beatrice Fihn, Ican’s executive director, said the ultimate aim was something more enduring: the delegitimization of nuclear weapons around the world. “It makes it harder to see what is happening as you’re maybe not seeing so many people out on the streets,” said Fihn, who accepted the 2017 Nobel peace prize on Ican’s behalf. But she added: “The movement is very much here, and we’re definitely growing and building.” While continuing the work of CND and the nuclear freeze movement, Ican and its 652 partner organisations around the world are seeking inspiration from other forms of civil society action, including the campaigns to ban landmines and cluster munitions, which sought to lay down new norms, and redraw the red lines of what is acceptable on the international stage. “We’re trying to undo the brainwashing of accepting nuclear weapons as normal,” Fihn said. The movement’s greatest source of leverage, she argued, was the need of nuclear weapons for legitimacy. “We see that with Russia right now. They’re fighting hard to re-establish legitimacy around the nuclear weapons and their security council seat and around the narrative of this war. And to me, it’s a sign that they are vulnerable.” Kate Hudson, CND’s general secretary, says new membership has surged since Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine was unleashed. “Activism is there in a big way, but it’s taking new forms, and it’s more fluid than previously: the way people understand and act on the links between issues, politically and in campaigning terms,” Hudson said. The nuclear disarmament movement is no longer in a silo of its own, she argued, as it shares common concerns for those fighting to stop climate crisis, or to uphold social justice in a world where governments are spending huge amounts on nuclear stockpiles while the poorest people in their society are cold and hungry. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement is now framing nuclear disarmament as a social justice issue for many newly recruited activists, making it a far more diverse field. Mari Faines, partner for mobilisation in the Global Zero disarmament advocacy group, said BLM prompted her to see more clearly the “correlation between the systems of policing and militarism”, and the overlap between the nuclear weapons complex, social justice struggles and other existential threats. “I’m hopeful and optimistic that this new wave of young and diverse voices that are stepping into this space are thinking through that,” Faines said. “They’re thinking about diplomatic answers in a different way. They’re reimagining what security could and should look like.” Molly Hurley, who was born in China but was adopted by a white American family, said the nuclear disarmament movement was not quite as open as it thought itself to be. “The nuke space is not the most welcoming for young people, for women of colour, for anyone of colour,” she said. After a few years working for disarmament activist groups, Hurley, who turns 27 in November, has started an arts degree in Baltimore. She still made the trip to a nuclear conference in Washington put on last month by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She explained: “The issues themselves are things I can’t just stop caring about.” As Russia steps up its aggression in Ukraine, a sense of dread and anxiety has spread among Hurley’s friends. For them, she said, it is just one more existential threat over which they have no control. “One of my friends specifically told me: I am just so overwhelmed by the prospects of the entire world ending due to the decisions of just a few white guys who I will never meet and who will never listen to anything I have to say,” she said. Hurley is experimenting with new ways to talk about geopolitical threats. While working on her art degree, she writes a column on the Inkstick website, and her latest was about what the US and China might learn from the enemies-to-lovers trope in romantic fiction. “You cannot fear-monger your way to a mass movement,” she said, arguing that what has been perceived as apathy within her generation was really a “coping mechanism for hopelessness”. The solution, she argued, was to offer some grounds for hope. “There are things that we can do and we need to make clear all these feasible, very concrete steps that can be taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jul/12/tour-de-france-jasper-philipsen-stage-11-cycling-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-12T16:06:31Z","webTitle":"Tour de France: Jasper Philipsen powers to fourth sprint win this year on stage 11","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/12/tour-de-france-jasper-philipsen-stage-11-cycling-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jul/12/tour-de-france-jasper-philipsen-stage-11-cycling-report","fields":{"bodyText":"Jasper Philipsen took his fourth win of this Tour de France, claiming stage 11 from Clermont-Ferrand to Moulins by sprinting clear of his closest rival Dylan Groenewegen, of Team Jayco AlUla, in the final 100 metres. The Belgian – already a winner in Bayonne, Nogaro and Bordeaux – mastered the fast finish with ease. This despite the absence of his steadfast lead‑out man and Alpecin-Deceuninck teammate Mathieu van der Poel, who was dropped by the bunch, after illness. “I can win without Mathieu, but of course he makes it more easy,” Philipsen said. “I had to find my wheel [to follow] and it’s also finding the space. It’s hectic and dangerous, but I’m happy I could find a good wheel. Groenewegen opened up early, and I could go over [the top].” The Tour’s defending champion, Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma), finished safely in the peloton and retains a 17-second lead over Tadej Pogacar (UAE Team Emirates). A stage earmarked by the sprinters and the baroudeurs (or breakaway artists) stuck to the script, with a three-man move dominating the proceedings until the last of the trio, Daniel Oss (TotalEnergies) was finally swept up with 13km to race. The speed increased as the riders sped over the Pont Régemortes, bridging the Allier river, despite steady rain falling in the closing kilometres. But Philipsen was always in control and unleashed his power in the final 100m to secure a comfortable victory. He now leads the points classification by 150 points. With the peloton moving steadily towards the Rhone, before crossing towards the Jura and Friday’s next summit finish on the Grand Colombier, speculation continues on how high Yorkshire’s Tom Pidcock can finish in the General Classification. “You can’t say he couldn’t podium,” Rod Ellingworth, the Ineos Grenadiers deputy principal, said. “I think it’s in reach. He’s in that ballpark.” Pidcock is eighth overall, almost five and a half minutes behind the race leader Vingegaard. Ellingworth said of Pidcock: “He wouldn’t want to lose any more time to the group below the leading two, but I think [a top-three finish] is possible. I definitely think top five is very realistic. “He’s got that ability to raise his game on the day. You could see that when he won Strade Bianche. All the guys I know who have that ability, who have won Olympic and world titles, they don’t crumble.” Meanwhile the uncertainty over Mark Cavendish’s future continues, fuelled by the suggestion from his Astana Qazaqstan team that he postpone his planned retirement until the end of 2024, in order to compete in next year’s Tour. According to his sprint consultant and former teammate, Mark Renshaw, Cavendish is now at home in Essex, awaiting surgery on his fractured collarbone. No decision has yet been taken on postponing his retirement, although it is thought that the 38-year-old will wait a couple of months before making a final call on his future. While Cavendish ponders his plans, the evergreen Geraint Thomas, second overall in the Giro d’Italia this year and third in the 2022 Tour, is expected to sign a new two-year contract with Ineos Grenadiers. “I think we’re getting there,” Ellingworth said of negotiations with Thomas. “Even without results, his presence is massive. You can’t underestimate what Geraint brings to the team, on the bus, in training camps. The bigger the competition, the better he gets.” Vingegaard may retain the race lead, but his post-race press conferences are becoming increasingly surreal, as the media continues to chisel at his aloof exterior. Asked to respond to the French newspaper Libération’s suggestion that he struggled with the “impossibility of being in the world”, the Dane looked flummoxed. “‘The impossibility of being in the world?’” he repeated after a long pause. “I don’t even know what that means. That’s a very deep question.” He added: “I guess we all are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-represents-the-grassroots-people-thailands-divisive-former-leader-returns","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T12:49:58Z","webTitle":"‘Thaksin represents the grassroots people’: Thailand’s divisive former leader returns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-represents-the-grassroots-people-thailands-divisive-former-leader-returns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-represents-the-grassroots-people-thailands-divisive-former-leader-returns","fields":{"bodyText":"Thaksin Shinawatra hasn’t held political office since he was ousted in 2006, and, until Tuesday, he had not set foot in Thailand in more than 15 years. But despite this, he has remained one of the country’s most influential and polarising politicians. Born in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, Thaksin became a police officer before developing a fortune as a telecoms tycoon. Aged 48, he formed the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party and swept to power in 2001 with a landslide election victory. Thaksin was the first politician to harness the electoral clout of rural voters in the north and north-east of Thailand, and he offered policies that improved their livelihoods. Thaksin introduced a universal healthcare scheme, village funds to stimulate growth, as well as policies to boost entrepreneurship and help the country recover from the Asian financial crisis. He also presided over the repayment of the debt Thailand owed to the IMF ahead of schedule. Many of his supporters associate his time in office with economic prosperity. “Thaksin represents the grassroots people,” said Damrong Khongpanya, 61, who travelled for 10 hours from his home in Nong Khai in north-east Thailand to welcome Thaksin at the airport. Thaksin cared for farmers, said Damrong, who farms rice and owns a rubber plantation. “I didn’t have a car before, but I was able to buy one, I was able to send my children to graduate from university,” he said. Thaksin became an increasingly divisive figure, however. His critics, often associated with conservatives in Bangkok, accused him of corruption and abuse of power. In particular, he faced a major scandal over the tax-free sale of the Shinawatra family’s majority stakes in his telecoms empire Shin Corp to a foreign company. He was also accused of lacking principles or sufficient deference for the monarchy, and of being a threat to its power. A struggle between Thaksin and his opponents in the military-royalist establishment left Thailand bitterly divided and led to periods of political turmoil. The military seized power in a coup twice, the courts repeatedly dissolved parties and banned individuals from politics, prolonged street protests gripped Bangkok and an army crackdown left more than 90 of Thaksin’s supporters dead. Thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has lived in exile since 2008 to avoid legal charges, which he is now facing after his return to Bangkok. His sister, the former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, suffered the same fate in 2014 and is still in exile. Even from abroad, Thaksin remained influential, often sharing his views on social media, and giving talks under the alias Tony Woodsome on the Clubhouse platform. He is Thailand’s most electorally successful politician, and parties associated with him have had the most seats in every election since 2001 – except for this year’s vote. In May’s election, despite Pheu Thai (his party’s third incarnation after the first two were suppressed) aspiring to win by a landslide, it was in fact the youthful pro-democracy party Move Forward that secured the most votes, though it was blocked from taking office by military-appointed senators. Among the crowds of mostly older supporters who turned out to welcome Thaksin on Tuesday, some noted that younger voters were increasingly turning to Move Forward. It was the only party bold enough to call for reforms to the law that protects the monarchy from criticism, said one Pheu Thai supporter. “Move Forward is very brave to talk about it. Pheu Thai is still stuck on the other side. Move Forward is very brave and they want to fight for the people.” In an ironic twist, Thaksin’s party has joined with his old military opponents to form a coalition. Some supporters say they understand that the party must do so to overcome electoral hurdles introduced following the last coup. Others view it as sign the party has abandoned its democratic values, and question if the move is merely part of a deal to allow Thaksin to return – something his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, a party official, has denied. On Tuesday, after flying into Bangkok on a private jet, he was taken to the prison. The supreme court said in a statement that he faces an eight-year sentence. However, many have speculated that with his party sharing power with its old rivals, he may be granted a softer option."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T15:33:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: head of occupied Zaporizhzhia plans referendum on joining Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” Balitsky said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Russia-appointed officials in Zaporizhzhia earlier said that the administration planned to proceed with a referendum even if Russia did not gain control over the entire region. Zaporizhzhia city is still held by Ukraine. Ukraine and its western allies have said that any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. In 2014, Moscow and its proxies carried out a widely condemned referendum in Crimea, weeks after its forces seized the peninsula. On Sunday, Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia would be impossible if the country proceeded with such votes in the occupied areas. “Our country’s position remains what it always has been. We will give up nothing of what is ours,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation. “If the occupiers proceed along the path of pseudo-referendums they will close for themselves any chance of talks with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will clearly need at some point. Balitsky on Monday gave no further details about the timing of the referendum. Bloomberg, citing two unnamed sources familiar with Moscow’s strategy, earlier reported that the Kremlin was aiming to conduct the referendums by 15 September. Kremlin-appointed officials in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia had already instigated a number of measures aimed at bringing the occupied regions closer to Russia and setting the stage for a future referendum. Earlier this summer, the Russian occupation authorities had started to hand out Russian passports to locals in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow has also forced Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to follow the Russian curriculum, while “We are with Russia” billboards have sprung up across occupied cities. In a move further signalling Moscow’s intentions, the pro-Russian authorities in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have set up local “elections committees” that are to be responsible for running the referendums. President Vladimir Putin initially denied that Moscow was seeking to occupy new land when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. However, he has since made a string of statements in which he sought to justify what he portrayed as Russia’s historic quests to win back Russian lands. Last month, Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said that Moscow had expanded its war aims in Ukraine, saying they now extended to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly hinted that it would recognise the referendums held in the seized Ukrainian territories, which would present the opportunity for Putin to declare the conquered areas as Russian territory. Ukraine, boosted by western weapons, has vowed to mount a major counteroffensive in the country’s south. However, the annexation of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia could complicate Ukraine’s attempts to recapture the areas: if annexed by Moscow, the territories would be protected by the country’s nuclear arsenal. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, the retired British general Sir Richard Barrons said that a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in the southern regions annexed by Moscow would raise the prospect of Russia using “small nuclear weapons”. “Ukraine would now be pushing into territory that Russia has declared as Russia, and at that point doctrinally and probably politically, Russia will start to reach for its tactical, its small nuclear weapons,” Barrons said, adding that those weapons would have a radius of “roughly two miles”. “We need to think through that and not regard it as some sort of terrible surprise that is completely unthinkable,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/30/the-guardian-view-on-a-new-alliance-between-wales-and-cornwall-unlocking-celtic-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-30T17:30:13Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on a new alliance between Wales and Cornwall: unlocking Celtic energy | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/30/the-guardian-view-on-a-new-alliance-between-wales-and-cornwall-unlocking-celtic-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/30/the-guardian-view-on-a-new-alliance-between-wales-and-cornwall-unlocking-celtic-energy","fields":{"bodyText":"David Lloyd George would no doubt have approved of the collaboration agreement signed this month by Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, and Linda Taylor, the leader of Cornwall council. In 1910, Britain’s only Welsh prime minister told a Falmouth crowd that Wales and Cornwall shared “the same Celtic passion for liberty”. These days, they also share common challenges and – in the field of renewable energy – transformative new prospects. Later this year, a bidding process will begin for leases to build enough floating windfarms in the Celtic Sea to power 3m homes by 2035. Longer term, the hope is to generate six times that output from an area off the north Cornwall and south Wales coasts. Investment in wind has hitherto focused on the North Sea, exploiting existing infrastructure associated with oil and gas. But developments in offshore technologies have dramatically expanded the economic horizon at Europe’s western edge. As Mr Drakeford put it in a joint press conference with Ms Taylor: “Where our geography has been against us in many ways for economic development, now suddenly being on the edge is an advantage in terms of wind and marine energy.” For some of the most deprived areas in western Europe, this could be seriously good news if economic benefits are channelled into local communities and supply chains. Working to ensure that a renewables boom translates into good local jobs is one key theme of the Celtic Heritage Cornwall-Wales agreement. In other respects, Cornwall is seeking to learn from areas where the Welsh have already paved the way. In north Wales, Gwynedd council is pioneering a radical approach to a second homes crisis that has priced local people out of tourist areas. Cornwall, which has 36,000 second homes and Airbnbs, and a housing waiting list of 25,000, has the same problems, and a rising level of local exasperation. Culturally, the revival of Welsh‑speaking has been a national success story, which lovers of other Celtic languages, including Cornish, would like to emulate. In both cases, devolution has allowed Wales crucial room for manoeuvre not currently available in England’s south-west. Cornwall – although its council recently decided against an upgraded devolution deal linked to an elected mayor – needs greater local autonomy and powers to address a unique set of challenges relating to geography, transport, housing, seasonal tourism and cultural identity. From mining to fishing, Britain’s far west has a proud and productive economic history. But in the post-industrial era, economic decline has been accompanied by a boom in holiday homes and tourism, and not much else. As one of biggest renewable energy projects in Europe begins to take shape in the Celtic Sea, the times are changing. Mining the huge lithium deposits in Cornwall, along with tin and tungsten, could play a major role in domestic battery production, offering another reason for economic optimism. Central government will need to play its part in attracting the necessary investment, through adequate incentives and subsidies. But to exploit potentially game-changing possibilities, Cornwall’s housing, transport and skills base will need to be fit for purpose. Enhanced devolution will make that easier to achieve. Forging a common Celtic agenda with Wales is a smart move in the right direction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-05T16:46:57Z","webTitle":"Japanese premier warns of Ukraine-style invasion by ‘autocratic powers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida have warned that the invasion of Ukraine could be replicated in east Asia if democratic powers do not stand up to autocratic ones. “Ukraine may be east Asia tomorrow,” Kishida said on Thursday during a visit to London, as he called for Indo-Pacific leaders to recognise that the invasion of Ukraine was not just a European problem. Asked about the implications for Taiwan, he said: “We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia.” He added: “Russia’s egregious aggression against Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, which prohibits the use of force against a nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Earlier, Johnson said: “We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. “And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia.” The two countries have signed a mutual access agreement for their two forces, in part dedicated to keep the seas free and open. Kishida also announced new sanctions, including an asset freeze on 140 Russian individuals and the expansion of an export ban to include Russian military firms. The package was announced the day after Russia imposed asset bans and travel freezes on 60 Japanese officials, including Japanese cabinet members and the prime minister himself. Kishida had described the Russian action as completely unacceptable. Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party has recently proposed a substantial increase in defence spending – possibly to an amount on a par with 2% of gross domestic product, up from the current 1% – and the development of the capacity to attack missile-launching sites in an enemy’s territory. He said that, in the wake of the Russian invasion, he was trying to instil a crisis mentality in the Japanese people. Facing elections in July and rising energy prices that are squeezing voters’ budgets, Kishida said nuclear power would form a bigger part of the country’s future energy policy mix. He said Japan would address the “vulnerability of our own energy self-sufficiency” by broadening where it buys energy from, promoting renewables and using nuclear power to diversify its sources of generation. Japan has become more reliant on Russian gas since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown, devastating its north-eastern region. The country is reluctant to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. Kishida’s visit to London was the conclusion of a major trip that saw him visit Asean members Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Japan is chair of the G7 next year and Kishida is trying to rally east Asia into accepting that Russia’s actions, born of authoritarianism, represent a threat to stability, and that, by extension, the region may have to resist China. Many countries in the region would prefer not to take sides in a contest between China and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T17:03:40Z","webTitle":"Three Tory cheers for the apocalypse after Liz Truss’s nuclear pledge | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/three-tory-cheers-for-the-apocalypse-after-liz-truss-nuclear-pledge","fields":{"bodyText":"What a thoughtful, enlightened piece by Jacinda Ardern (The world stands on a nuclear precipice – we must avoid catastrophe, 25 August), in such contrast to the words of our wannabe prime minister Liz Truss, who said this week that she would be ready to use nuclear weapons even though it would mean global annihilation (cue applause from Tory party members).

Does she enjoy making people feel uncomfortable? “Yeah,” she laughs, “I’m OK with that.” Far from the world of red-nosed children’s entertainers, Pauroso found her way to clowning through sketch comedy. As a kid she would watch I Love Lucy reruns with her grandma, harbouring dreams of becoming a serious actor. But over time she found a different level of performance she was more aligned to: “this natural stupidity that I bring to the table”. In conversation, Pauroso is gawkily cool. On stage – where “I feel like I’m in a heightened state” – she is the epitome of considered confidence. In her last show, Gutterplum, Pauroso packed an entire lifespan into 60 minutes, from blood-spewing teen to the tangled grey pubic hairs of old age. The character she’s taking to the Edinburgh fringe has a very different relationship to flesh. Vanessa 5000 is “a friendly sex robot,” Pauroso beams. With a modulated voice and dishwasher-safe holes, the humanoid pleasure device is a “brilliant idiot who talks like a naughty Siri and moves like an animatronic stripper”. Pauroso has taken inspiration from all over: The Terminator, US artist Jordan Wolfson’s dirt-splattered Female Figure, the intense Georgian pantomime she learned when she was training with movement company Synetic Theatre. Vanessa 5000 initially arose out of the simple desire to play at being a robot, but as the conversation around AI and sex tech grew, the character gained a kind of intellectual padding around its delightfully foolish core. With her dad in the army, Pauroso had moved 10 times and lived on three continents before graduating from high school. She came through the prestigious Groundlings school in LA, which boasts Will Ferrell and Melissa McCarthy as former students, and it was there where she met Corey Podell, director of Vanessa 5000. She was looking for her next steps when she saw Natalie Palamides, the comic behind Netflix’s Nate, which began life at the Edinburgh fringe. “I was instantly like: what is that girl doing?” She took a clown class with Palamides’ teacher, which taught her how to play with the audience and “opened up the possibilities of what comedy could be”. In LA, clowning has had a meteoric rise in recent years. Classes are increasingly popular and, over the pandemic, Pauroso took part in Clown Zoo: masked outdoor performances staged for passersby on their lunch breaks. But the art of clowning remains somewhat elusive. “It’s fun to be messy and wild and all that,” Pauroso considers. “But I think to really master it you need sensitivity and discipline, which is harder to come by.” Clad in latex, with jagged movements and eyes unblinking to the point that her contacts pop out, Vanessa 5000 demands physical rigour of Pauroso. The show is styled as a product demonstration, with the audience invited to play games with Vanessa, and test her powers as she gains first capabilities, and then consciousness. While silliness remains at the show’s core, the character is also a vessel for larger questions around technology, pleasure and control. “Is she victim or threat? Slave or god?” Pauroso asks. Toying with the audience is key to Pauroso’s style. In Gutterplum, an unwitting audience member served as her husband for the duration of the show. “In Edinburgh, I once picked a guy who was wasted but it was too late to throw him back.” She’s now cannier picking her subjects, for whom she has tremendous gratitude. She’s not out to embarrass anyone, other than perhaps herself. The last time she performed Gutterplum, the audience participant messaged afterwards saying that it had “fucked him up on a spiritual level” – which “I’m pretty sure is a good thing,” she says. In her scratch performances so far as Vanessa, she is glad not to have encountered any issues with boundaries. In a clip of her performing as the sex robot, she starts to glitch and, posed on all fours, asks an audience member to spank her to restart. “Typically they don’t go right for it. They’ll touch me on my head and I’m like, ‘Not there,’” she smirks. But no one steps over the lines she draws. She’s always, very clearly, in control. “I think people are probably scared of me a little bit,” she laughs. “If they’re onstage with me, they know they’re in the danger zone. So really, I’m worried about their boundaries rather than mine.” Courtney Pauroso: Vanessa 5000 is at the Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 27 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/25/the-world-stands-on-a-nuclear-precipice-we-must-avoid-catastrophe","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T22:59:37Z","webTitle":"The world stands on a nuclear precipice – we must find a way to avoid catastrophe | Jacinda Ardern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/25/the-world-stands-on-a-nuclear-precipice-we-must-avoid-catastrophe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/25/the-world-stands-on-a-nuclear-precipice-we-must-avoid-catastrophe","fields":{"bodyText":"In 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict for the first and only time. 355,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki by two nuclear bombs. Two. That number alone puts in stark perspective the world’s current arsenal of about 13,000 nuclear weapons. And yet in many ways the 13,000 weapons held globally represents progress; it’s less than a quarter of the more than 63,000 weapons in circulation in 1985 during the cold war. But what John F Kennedy said in 1961 at the United Nations is as urgent now as it ever was: “We must abolish these weapons before they abolish us.” Over the more than 50 years since the inception of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty it’s played an important role in lowering the risk of these weapons abolishing us. In addition to the near 80% reduction in nuclear weapons, the treaty has also contributed to keeping a lid on the number of countries acquiring them. More countries have ratified the treaty than any other arms limitation and disarmament agreement. Right now in New York, there is an opportunity to go even further. And we must. Our world is at greater risk of nuclear catastrophe than at any time since the height of the cold war. Growing superpower tensions and two decades of stalled progress on arms control have pushed the risk of these weapons closer to reality. Currently 191 countries are meeting at the UN to renew the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and negotiations are going down to the wire. These talks offer a chance to breathe new life into nuclear disarmament at a time when the world needs that more than ever. Nuclear catastrophe is not an abstract threat but a real world risk. Nuclear weapons could be deployed in a conflict, as Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has intimated, or they could be deployed by miscalculation or mistake – real possibilities in times of heightened tension. New Zealand is calling on the nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, China, France and the UK – to step back from the nuclear abyss, and provide that leadership by committing to negotiate a new multilateral nuclear disarmament framework. But from one of the best geographical positions in the world to be should nuclear fallout occur, why does New Zealand feel so strongly about this issue? We are a Pacific nation. Our region bears the scars of decades of nuclear testing, on both the people and the lands and waters of our region. That’s why for 35 years New Zealand has been proudly nuclear-free and an international advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons. This does not mean we are naive to real world dynamics, nor does our geographic location mean we have the luxury of a moral stance that others do not. In fact, New Zealand’s message – that nuclear weapons do not make anyone safer and no longer have a place in our world – reflects the view of the overwhelming majority of countries. We just need to believe a different approach is possible. We only have to look back in our history to map a path to a safer future. The lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and of testing in the Pacific, are reminder enough that there is never justification for the deployment of nuclear weapons. The challenges of agreeing multilateral nuclear disarmament can seem overwhelming. But it’s not a task that can be put off indefinitely. Right now, the treaty is under stress. It is affected by geopolitical developments including tension between the nuclear weapon states. But, more fundamentally, there is growing scepticism and frustration about the intention of the nuclear weapon states to ever fully implement their nuclear disarmament commitments under the treaty, with those states arguing the global security environment makes doing so too difficult. If this continues, there is a real prospect of countries losing faith in the treaty – putting at risk both the treaty’s role in progressing nuclear disarmament, and in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons material. There is a lot at stake in New York this week. Some might say that in the current global environment a new nuclear arms race is inevitable, and with it a further undermining of our nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. But I cannot accept a logic that suggests insecurity and instability render us incapable of doing the very thing that would help make the world less insecure and less unstable – an idea that the history of the treaty itself shows is false. There can and should be a different trajectory – one of urgent leadership, of recognition of the nuclear precipice on which we are all standing, and of continued progress in our efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons. It’s not only possible – it’s necessary.

For almost half a century, I have reported on scientific issues and no decade has been complete without two or three announcements by scientists claiming their work would soon allow science to recreate the processes that drive the sun. The end result would be the generation of clean, cheap nuclear fusion that would transform our lives. Such announcements have been rare recently, so it gave me a warm glow to realise that standards may be returning to normal. By deploying a set of 192 lasers to bombard pellets of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, researchers at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) in Livermore, California, were able to generate temperatures only found in stars and thermonuclear bombs. The isotopes then fused into helium, releasing excess energy, they reported. It was a milestone event but not a major one, although this did not stop the US government and swaths of the world’s media indulging in a widespread hyping jamboree over the laboratory’s accomplishment. Researchers had “overcome a major barrier” to reaching fusion, the BBC gushed, while the Wall Street Journal described the achievement as a breakthrough that could herald an era of clean, cheap energy. It is certainly true that nuclear fusion would have a beneficial impact on our planet by liberating vast amounts of energy without generating high levels of carbon emissions and would be an undoubted boost in the battle against climate change. The trouble is that we have been presented with such visions many times before. In 1958, Sir John Cockcroft claimed his Zeta fusion project would supply the world with “an inexhaustible supply of fuel”. It didn’t. In 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced they had achieved fusion using simple laboratory equipment, work that made global headlines but which has never been replicated. To this list you can also add the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter), a huge facility being built in Saint-Paul-lès-Durance in Provence, France, that was supposed to achieve fusion by 2023 but which is over 10 years behind schedule and tens of billions of dollars over budget. In each case, it was predicted that the construction of the first commercially viable nuclear fusion plants was only a decade or two away and would transform our lives. Those hopes never materialised and have led to a weary cynicism spreading among hacks and scientists. As they now joke: “Fusion is 30 years away – and always will be.” It was odd for Jennifer Granholm, the US energy secretary, to argue that the NIF’s achievement was “one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century”. This is a hard claim to justify for a century that has already witnessed the discovery of the Higgs boson, the creation of Covid-19 vaccines, the launch of the James Webb telescope and the unravelling of the human genome. By comparison, the ignition event at the NIF is second-division stuff. Most scientists have been careful in their responses to the over-hyping of the NIF “breakthrough”. They accept that a key step has been taking towards commercial fusion power but insist such plants remain distant goals. They should not be seen as likely saviours that will extract us from the desperate energy crisis we now face – despite all the claims that were made last week. Humanity has brought itself to a point where its terrible dependence on fossil fuels threatens to trigger a 2C jump in global temperatures compared with our pre-industrial past. The consequences will include flooding, fires, worsening storms, rising sea levels, spreading diseases and melting ice caps. Here, scientists are clear. Fusion power will not arrive in time to save the world. “We are still a way off commercial fusion and it cannot help us with the climate crisis now,” said Aneeqa Khan, a research fellow in nuclear fusion at Manchester University. This view was backed by Tony Roulstone, a nuclear energy researcher at Cambridge University. “This result from NIF is a success for science, but it is still a long way from providing useful, abundant clean energy.” At present, there are two main routes to nuclear fusion. One involves confining searing hot plasma in a powerful magnetic field. The Iter reactor follows such an approach. The other – adopted at the NIF facility – uses lasers to blast deuterium-tritium pellets causing them to collapse and fuse into helium. In both cases, reactions occur at more than 100 million C and involve major technological headaches in controlling them. Fusion therefore remains a long-term technology, although many new investors and entrepreneurs – including Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos – have recently turned their attention to the field, raising hopes that a fresh commercial impetus could reinvigorate the development of commercial plants. This input is to be welcomed but we should be emphatic: fusion will not arrive in time to save the planet from climate change. Electricity plants powered by renewable sources or nuclear fission offer the only short-term alternatives to those that burn fossil fuels. We need to pin our hopes on these power sources. Fusion may earn its place later in the century but it would be highly irresponsible to rely on an energy source that will take at least a further two decades to materialise – at best. • Robin McKie is the Observer’s science and environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/19/eu-split-over-subsidies-for-coal-plants-as-poland-seeks-extension","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-19T15:05:18Z","webTitle":"EU split over subsidies for coal plants as Poland seeks extension","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/19/eu-split-over-subsidies-for-coal-plants-as-poland-seeks-extension","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/19/eu-split-over-subsidies-for-coal-plants-as-poland-seeks-extension","fields":{"bodyText":"EU nations have failed to agree on new plans for energy supplies across the bloc after a bid to extend subsidies for coal burning power stations was blocked. EU energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg ended talks without a joint stance on the rules that also seek to avoid a repeat of last year’s energy crisis, when record-high gas prices left consumers with soaring energy bills. The talks were complicated by a late proposal by Sweden, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, to allow countries to prolong capacity mechanism subsidies for coal power plants that pay generators to keep enough capacity on standby to avoid blackouts. Countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg had objected to the proposal on coal subsidies, saying it would undermine Europe’s goals to fight climate change. Earlier Luxembourg’s energy minister describing the proposal as “astonishing”. Luxembourg’s energy minister, Claude Turmes, said he could not believe the proposal, which was made on Friday, days before a planned summit of energy ministers from across the bloc, was even on the table given the EU’s commitment to combating the climate emergency. “Friday, the Swedish presidency did something really astonishing which is weakening our climate policy by … reopening the possibility to subsidise coal power plants,” he told reporters before the summit in Luxembourg. Some countries consider this a measure to help Poland, which uses coal to produce about 70% of its energy. Poland is expected to soon surpass Germany as Europe’s top power polluter due to aggressive planned reductions in fossil fuel use across Germany, creating assumptions that Poland will have no choice but to remain Europe’s most coal-reliant nation for years to come. So far this year, Poland has defied expectations by cutting coal use and pollution to the lowest level since at least 2014, and by raising clean power output to record highs just as Germany cut its clean generation by shutting nuclear reactors. “We have a big bloc of countries that will reject the proposal of the Swedish presidency … so it’s a clear no,” Turmes said ahead of the summit on Monday. Spain’s minister for ecological transition, Teresa Ribera, said some thought had to be given to Poland, which is heavily reliant on coal, while the French energy minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, said extending support to Poland was an “ambitious approach” – a hint Paris was more open towards the move than other member states like Germany. “We need to take into account the reality of each country to ensure their capacity to provide energy to their people and to their industries,” she said. Belgium sided with Luxembourg, describing such a move as “unacceptable”. Tinne van der Straeten, the energy minister, said: “In Belgium we already have in our national legislation the obligation to become climate neutral and to have a steep decline in emission by 2030 and 2040. So [the proposal] is something that we cannot accept,” she told reporters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/12/economy-inflation-corporations-raise-consumer-prices-democrats","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T10:12:51Z","webTitle":"The Democrats have a powerful campaign issue: price-gouging corporations | Robert Reich","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/economy-inflation-corporations-raise-consumer-prices-democrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/12/economy-inflation-corporations-raise-consumer-prices-democrats","fields":{"bodyText":"The economic goal should be more jobs at higher wages. Right? Yet the Federal Reserve, corporate economists and the Republican party have turned the goal upside down – into fewer jobs and lower wages. Otherwise, they say, we’ll face more inflation. Rubbish. This upside-down logic is pushing the United States economy toward a recession, which could hit about the same time as the next presidential election – which will make Joe Biden a one-term president, just as Fed-induced recessions made Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush one-term presidents. None of this is necessary. The Fed has raised borrowing costs at 10 consecutive meetings, pushing its benchmark rate to over 5%. Yet inflation has barely budged. In April, it dropped to 4.9% (year-over-year) from 5% in March – according to Wednesday’s Labor Bureau data. Why are the Fed’s rate hikes having so little effect? Because inflation is not being propelled by an overheated economy. It’s being propelled by overheated profits. Wage gains still lag behind price increases. Average hourly earnings grew by just 0.3% in March, with year-over-year growth of only 4.2%. Wages and salaries in the Employment Cost Index, a broader measure of worker compensation, have been trending downward for a year. Supply chains have returned to normal. Freight-trucking prices peaked in spring 2022 and since then have tumbled close to pre-pandemic levels. In March, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s global supply-chain-pressure index fell to its lowest level since 2008, and it has been dropping since December 2021. Prices for raw goods have also dropped from mid-2022 highs. Meanwhile, consumers have used up whatever extra money they accumulated during the pandemic. So, what’s causing inflation? Corporations with enough monopoly power to raise their prices and fatten their profits – which the Fed’s rate hikes barely affect. Even the Wall Street Journal (in a lead article last week headlined “Why Is Inflation So Sticky? It Could Be Corporate Profits”) spotlights corporations boosting profit margins. Corporate profit margins were around 10% in 2019. Last year, they reached over 15% – their highest level since 1950 – rising 6.6% year over year. By the end of 2022, profits were still near 14%. Prices remain sky-high because corporations got hooked on price-gouging and won’t give it up. Corporate economists argue that businesses couldn’t possibly be padding their profits; if they could, they would have done it before the inflation of the last two years. Baloney. Businesses have been using the cover of inflation to justify price increases, so consumers accept them. According to Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, businesses are betting that consumers will go along with the price hikes because they assume prices are being driven by supply bottlenecks and higher energy prices. Corporations “are confident that they can convince consumers that it isn’t their fault, and it won’t damage their brand”. Last month, Procter &amp; Gamble said in an earnings call that it had boosted its profit margins in the first three months of the year by raising its prices. Last Thursday, Budweiser-owner Anheuser-Busch reported a jump in profit margins for the first quarter by raising its prices. Chipotle’s chief financial and administrative officer, Jack Hartung, said in the firm’s first-quarter earnings call that menu prices have risen by about 10%, and chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said they were “staying the course” on pricing – despite the fact profits were up 17% for the quarter. “We’re in a really strong position that when we’re ready and we believe it’s necessary to pull that pricing lever, we can.” Big corporations have enough monopoly power to raise prices. With just a handful of companies dominating each market, it’s easy to implicitly agree they’ll all raise their prices. What to do about this? Put the burden of fighting inflation on corporations rather than on workers and consumers. Instead of relying on the Fed to “tame” inflation via fewer jobs and lower wages, Congress should pass legislation that: – Allows the justice department to bust up monopolies (and prevent further consolidation through mergers and acquisitions) when three or fewer corporations have more than half the sales of a particular market. – Directs the Federal Trade Commission to find that any such corporation has engaged in unlawful price gouging whenever it has raised prices higher than the rate of inflation and impose a fine that would claw back those unlawful gains. – Permits the treasury department to impose a windfall profits tax on large corporations, above a specific reasonable rate of return or profit margin. Republicans won’t go along with any of this, of course. Which presents Biden and the Democrats with a clear opportunity. Make this a major campaign theme for 2024. Ask the public: do you want more jobs and higher wages, or do you want large corporations making fatter profits by raising prices?

This wasn’t the case for Sam Bankman-Fried and his followers, powerful actors who have embraced a school of thought within the effective altruism movement called “longtermism”. In February, the Future Fund, a philanthropic organization endowed by the now-disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur, announced that it would be disbursing more than $100m – and possibly up to $1bn – this year on projects to “improve humanity’s long-term prospects”. The slightly cryptic reference might have been a bit puzzling to those who think of philanthropy as funding homelessness charities and medical NGOs in the developing world. In fact, the Future Fund’s particular areas of interest include artificial intelligence, biological weapons and “space governance”, a mysterious term referring to settling humans in space as a potential “watershed moment in human history”. Out-of-control artificial intelligence was another area of concern for Bankman-Fried – so much so that in September the Future Fund announced prizes of up to $1.5m to anyone who could make a persuasive estimate of the threat that unrestrained AI might pose to humanity. “We think artificial intelligence” is “the development most likely to dramatically alter the trajectory of humanity this century”, the Future Fund said. “With the help of advanced AI, we could make enormous progress toward ending global poverty, animal suffering, early death and debilitating disease.” But AI could also “acquire undesirable objectives and pursue power in unintended ways, causing humans to lose all or most of their influence over the future”. Less than two months after the contest was announced, Bankman-Fried’s $32bn cryptocurrency empire had collapsed, much of the Future Fund’s senior leadership had resigned and its AI prizes may never be rewarded. Nor will most of the millions of dollars that Bankman-Fried had promised a constellation of charities and thinktanks affiliated with effective altruism, a once-obscure ethical movement that has become influential in Silicon Valley and the highest echelons of the international business and political worlds. ••• Longtermists argue that the welfare of future humans is as morally important – or more important – than the lives of current ones, and that philanthropic resources should be allocated to predicting, and defending against, extinction-level threats to humanity. But rather than giving out malaria nets or digging wells, longtermists prefer to allocate money to researching existential risk, or “x-risk”. In his recent book What We Owe the Future, William MacAskill – a 35-year-old moral philosopher at Oxford who has become the public intellectual face of effective altruism – makes a case for longtermism with a thought experiment about a hiker who accidentally shatters a glass bottle on a trail. A conscientious person, he holds, would immediately clean up the glass to avoid injuring the next hiker – whether that person comes in a week or in a century. Similarly, MacAskill argues that the number of potential future humans, over many generations for the duration of the species, far outnumbers the number currently alive; if we truly believe that all humans are equal, protecting future humans is more important than protecting human lives today. Some of longtermists’ funding interests, such as nuclear nonproliferation and vaccine development, are fairly uncontroversial. Others are more outlandish: investing in space colonization, preventing the rise of power-hungry AI, cheating death through “life-extension” technology. A bundle of ideas known as “transhumanism” seeks to upgrade humanity by creating digital versions of humans, “bioengineering” human-machine cyborgs and the like. People like the futurist Ray Kurzweil and his adherents believe that biotechnology will soon “enable a union between humans and genuinely intelligent computers and AI systems”, Robin McKie explained in the Guardian in 2018. “The resulting human-machine mind will become free to roam a universe of its own creation, uploading itself at will onto a ‘suitably powerful computational substrate’,” and thereby creating a kind of immortality. ••• This feverish techno-utopianism distracts funders from pressing problems that already exist here on Earth, said Luke Kemp, a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk who describes himself as an “EA-adjacent” critic of effective altruism. Left on the table, he says, are critical and credible threats that are happening right now, such as the climate crisis, natural pandemics and economic inequality. “The things they push tend to be things that Silicon Valley likes,” Kemp said. They’re the kinds of speculative, futurist ideas that tech billionaires find intellectually exciting. “And they almost always focus on technological fixes” to human problems “rather than political or social ones”. There are other objections. For one thing, lavishly expensive, experimental bioengineering would be accessible, especially initially, to “only a tiny sliver of humanity”, Kemp said; it could bring about a future caste system in which inequality is not only economic, but biological. This thinking is also dangerously undemocratic, he argued. “These big decisions about the future of humanity should be decided by humanity. Not by just a couple of white male philosophers at Oxford funded by billionaires. It is literally the most powerful, and least representative, strata of society imposing a particular vision of the future which suits them.” Kemp added: “I don’t think EAs – or at least the EA leadership – care very much about democracy.” In its more dogmatic varieties, he said, longtermism is preoccupied with “rationality, hardcore utilitarianism, a pathological obsession with quantification and neoliberal economics”. Organizations such as 80,000 Hours, a program for early-career professionals, tend to encourage would-be effective altruists into four main areas, Kemp said: AI research, research preparing for human-made pandemics, EA community-building and “global priorities research”, meaning the question of how funding should be allocated. The first two areas, though worthy of study, are “highly speculative”, Kemp said, and the second two are “self-serving”, since they channel money and energy back into the movement. This year, the Future Fund reports having recommended grants to worthy-seeming projects as various as research on “the feasibility of inactivating viruses via electromagnetic radiation” ($140,000); a project connecting children in India with online science, technology, engineering and mathematics education ($200,000); research on “disease-neutralizing therapeutic antibodies” ($1.55m); and research on childhood lead exposure ($400,000). But much of the Future Fund’s largesse seems to have been invested in longtermism itself. It recommended $1.2m to the Global Priorities Institute; $3.9m to the Long Term Future Fund; $2.9m to create a “longtermist coworking office in London”; $3.9m to create a “longtermist coworking space in Berkeley”; $700,000 to the Legal Priorities Project, a “longtermist legal research and field-building organization”; $13.9m to the Centre for Effective Altruism; and $15m to Longview Philanthropy to execute “independent grantmaking on global priorities research, nuclear weapons policy, and other longtermist issues.” Kemp argued that effective altruism and longtermism often seem to be working toward a kind of regulatory capture. “The long-term strategy is getting EAs and EA ideas into places like the Pentagon, the White House, the British government and the UN” to influence public policy, he said. There may be a silver lining in the timing of Bankman-Fried’s downfall. “In a way, it’s good that it happened now rather than later,” Kemp said. “He was planning on spending huge amounts of money on elections. At one stage, he said he was planning to spend up to a billion dollars, which would have made him the biggest donor in US political history. Can you imagine if that amount of money contributed to a Democratic victory – and then turned out to have been based on fraud? In an already fragile and polarized society like the US? That would have been horrendous.” ••• “The main tension to the movement, as I see it, is one that many movements deal with,” said Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy and a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. “A movement that was primarily fueled by regular people – and their passions, and interests, and different kinds of provenance – attracted a number of very wealthy funders,” and came to be driven by “the funding decisions, and sometimes just the public identities, of people like SBF and Elon Musk and a few others”. (Soskis noted that he has received funding from Open Philanthropy, an EA-affiliated foundation.) Effective altruism put Bankman-Fried, who lived in a luxury compound in the Bahamas, “on a pedestal, as this Corolla-driving, beanbag-sleeping, earning-to-give monk, which was clearly false”, Kemp said. Soskis thinks that effective altruism has a natural appeal to people in tech and finance – who tend to have an analytical and calculating way of thinking about problems – and EA, like all movements, spreads through social and work networks. Effective altruism is also attractive to wealthy people, Soskis believes, because it offers “a way to understand the marginal value of additional dollars”, particularly when talking of “vast sums that can defy comprehension”. The movement’s focus on numbers (“shut up and multiply”) helps hyper-wealthy people understand more concretely what $500m can do philanthropically versus, say, $500,000 or $50,000. One positive outcome, he thinks, is that EA-influenced donors publicly discuss their philanthropic commitments and encourage others to make them. Historically, Americans have tended to regard philanthropy as a private matter. But there’s something “which I think you can’t escape”, Soskis said. Effective altruism “isn’t premised on a strong critique of the way that money has been made. And elements of it were construed as understanding capitalism more generally as a positive force, and through a kind of consequentialist calculus. To some extent, it’s a safer landing spot for folks who want to sequester their philanthropic decisions from a broader political debate about the legitimacy of certain industries or ways of making money.” Kemp said that it is rare to hear EAs, especially longtermists, discuss issues such as democracy and inequality. “Honestly, I think that’s because it is something the donors don’t want us talking about.” Cracking down on tax avoidance, for example, would lead to major donors “losing both power and wealth”. The downfall of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, which has jeopardized the Future Fund and countless other longtermist organizations, may be revealing. Longtermists believe that future existential risks to humanity can be accurately calculated – yet, as the economist Tyler Cowen recently pointed out, they couldn’t even predict the existential threat to their own flagship philanthropic organization. There must be “soul-searching”, Soskis said. “Longtermism has a stain on it and I’m not sure when or if it will be fully removed.” “A billionaire is a billionaire,” the journalist Anand Giridharadas wrote recently on Twitter. His 2018 book Winners Take All sharply criticized the idea that private philanthropy will solve human problems. “Stop believing in good billionaires. Start organizing toward a good society.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T06:00:27Z","webTitle":"The 19th-century engineer who was ahead of his time on wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/james-blyth-scottish-engineer-wind-power","fields":{"bodyText":"It was 135 years ago that a Scottish engineer, James Blyth, invented the first wind-powered electrical generator.

He proposed installing electric lighting in the main street of the village, but local people thought the electric light to be “the work of the devil”. Blyth dreamed of a future in which every house would be lit by a wind turbine, and argued that wind power was good for the environment and cheaper than fossil fuels. Blyth was ahead of his time, but remains largely overlooked, even though he beat the American engineer Charles Brush and the Danish inventor Poul la Cour, who have been credited with inventing the wind turbine.

Two units at EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power for the grid on Tuesday afternoon. Their output will be ramped up depending on how much electricity can be generated from other sources. The Met Office has issued weather warnings for rain and snow across the UK, with temperatures of -4C expected in London and -6C in Birmingham. A combination of freezing temperatures pushing up demand for power and heating, and low wind cutting windfarm electricity generation have made generation conditions tight. Strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants in France, which supply Britain with electricity via subsea cables, have also raised concerns in recent days. The Nottinghamshire units are two of five covered by winter contingency contracts negotiated last year by the government to keep coal-fired power plants on standby for emergency use amid heightened concerns over power supplies this winter. The coal-fired plants, which also include units at Drax in Yorkshire and at Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, have been warmed for potential use several times this winter but stood down each time. The Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) has also asked two units at Drax in Yorkshire to warm up for potential use. Separately, ESO issued an electricity margin notice, telling the owners of all power plants to bring on extra power supplies between 4.30pm and 8.30pm on Tuesday. It later cancelled this requirement. National Grid stressed its measures to bolster supplies did not mean supplies were at risk. However, the ESO stopped short of paying consumers and businesses to turn down their energy use. Earlier on Tuesday, it issued a notice that it may employ its demand flexibility service on Wednesday but later said it would not run. The Grid has been on alert over risks of potential power cuts this winter because of concerns Russia would cut gas supplies into Europe, with a knock-on effect in Britain. However, a relatively mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe have eased these fears, and caused gas prices to fall sharply. A spokesperson for the ESO said that the coal units would offer “additional contingency to operate the network as normal”. In December, National Grid paid record amounts to encourage gas-fired power plants to crank up supply at short notice. Experts expected it to pay high prices to gas-fired plants again on Tuesday. Live ESO data showed gas-fired plants accounted for 54% of Great Britain’s electricity generation, with windfarms contributing 13% and nuclear 10%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T16:56:35Z","webTitle":"Powerful storm brings more wind, rain and snow to California","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/29/powerful-storm-more-wind-rain-snow-california-damage","fields":{"bodyText":"A powerful weather system has brought more wind, rain and snow to California, hitting a state already battered by months of storms. Forecasters said the storm was not as strong as the systems that pounded California all winter, but it was expected to pull a plume of Pacific moisture into the state as it tracked south. Still, heavy snow hit coastal mountains and the Sierra Nevada. Chains were required for vehicles on highways through the mountain region, and a section of US 395 on the eastern side of the range was closed due to snowfall. The Mammoth Mountain ski resort in the Eastern Sierra declared its snowiest season on record after 28in (70cm) of snow since Tuesday afternoon pushed season snowfall totals to 695in (17.6 meters) at its main lodge and 870 inches (22.1 meters) at the summit of the 11,053ft (3,369-meter) peak. Storm impacts were more modest in southern California, where precipitation was expected to decrease through the day. An unexpected series of powerful storms has pounded California since late December. The storms have claimed more than two dozen lives, caused flooding and landslides, and led to widespread damage to farm lands and infrastructure. Crews on Monday tore down a historic pier in Santa Cruz county that was in danger of collapse. The 500ft-long (152-meter) wooden pier at Seacliff State Beach was severely damaged by big surf in January. Built in 1930, the pier connected the beach to SS Palo Alto, a grounded first world war-era steamship known as the “cement ship”. On the positive side, the storms have brought much-needed water to a state that has suffered from a grueling drought. The storms have raised reservoir levels and built an extraordinary Sierra snowpack, a significant source of California’s water. As of Tuesday, the water content of the snowpack was 228% of the 1 April average, a benchmark for its historical peak, according to the state department of water resources. The state’s two largest reservoirs, Shasta and Oroville, have risen above their historical averages to date after being significantly depleted. The turnabout has allowed a rollback of some water use restrictions, although the California governor, Gavin Newsom, has been careful to not declare the drought over. Cities and farmers that rely on the Central Valley Project, the federally managed water system, got a big boost in their allocations on Tuesday. The increase in supply means that many providers of irrigation water supplied by the CVP will see the amount they can draw jump from as little as 35% of their contracted total to 80%. Providers for city and industrial uses will be allowed 100% of their historic use instead of just 75%, the bureau said. In southern California, the Metropolitan Water District is bringing water from the north to fill its huge Diamond Valley Lake, a reservoir that had diminished to 60% of capacity after three years of drought. It is expected to be full again by year’s end. “Nature gave us a lifeline,” the MWD general manager, Adel Hagekhalil, said on Monday as officials watched water pour into the reservoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T16:30:40Z","webTitle":"Most of Australia’s nuclear waste comes from Lucas Heights – should it stay there?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/17/most-of-australias-nuclear-waste-comes-from-lucas-heights-should-it-stay-there","fields":{"bodyText":"The vast majority of Australia’s future radioactive waste will be produced by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) Lucas Heights facility in Sydney, the latest figures show. For 40 years governments have pushed for a national radioactive waste storage facility, often claiming it is because currently waste is held at more than 100 sites across the country. But the latest statistics show almost all of it is in that one facility. A new inventory of Australia’s radioactive waste, published in September by the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency, shows a larger than expected increase in waste in the future. Australia’s waste is either low level (LLW), which is mainly from laboratories, or intermediate level (ILW), which is from nuclear medicine. ILW emits more radiation and requires more shielding. There are many variable factors, but the report notes that “the estimated volumes of Ansto’s future LLW and ILW are substantially greater than previously reported”. It estimates the levels of LLW in 100 years and ILW in 50 years. For LLW, that is a change in how future levels are measured. For ILW, it was a matter of having to revise existing estimates. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup “For LLW, the changes are mainly due to revised estimates of future waste generation rates (about 10% increase annually) and increased timeframes (100 years instead of 50 years waste volumes),” the report notes. “For ILW, the main reason is that volume uncertainty is now included in the packaged volume estimate, where it had not been included previously.” Ansto’s waste is estimated to make up 12,972 cubic metres of the country’s 13,287 cubic metres LLW (97.6%) in the next 100 years, and 3,753 cubic metres of the country’s 3,887 cubic metres ILW (96.8%). Dave Sweeney, the nuclear free campaigner from the Australian Conservation Foundation, is opposed to the federal government’s plan to move the country’s waste to a single facility near Kimba in South Australia. He says it should stay where it (mostly) is. “It’s Ansto’s waste facility,” he says. “Ansto’s 97% of intermediate and low level waste. It’s not a national facility. It’s Ansto’s facility. “It’s absolutely striking.” Sweeney says Ansto has the capacity to store the waste indefinitely, especially considering a recent $60m investment to expand its storage capacity. The local Aboriginal people, the Barngarla people, are also opposed to the site being on their traditional lands. The South Australian Greens senator Barbara Pocock says there is “no pressing problem” with waste storage, so they may as well leave it where it is. “They’re better off leaving it safely,” she says, “well protected, with all the right safeguards in place, than to pull it out and have a double-handling non-solution.” Pocock is also concerned about the transport of waste from Lucas Heights and other facilities to the planned South Australian site. “There hasn’t been a proper discussion in the SA community on the views of the transport of nuclear waste through our communities,” she says. An Ansto spokesperson says having a single facility is “in line with international best practice”, and moving the waste is in line with commitments given to the Lucas Heights community. “The vast majority of the radioactive waste we produce is directly associated with the production of nuclear medicine that every Australian, on average, will need during their lifetime,” the spokesperson says. “Because of this, Ansto will always need to have facilities to properly treat, prepare and consolidate these wastes before they can go to a national radioactive waste management facility. But we are not the appropriate place for Australia’s waste to be held.” The spokesperson says a facility of the size needed would not fit on the Ansto campus, that existing storage will be at full capacity within a decade, and the new storage will be at capacity by 2038. “Ultimately Ansto must be in the business of medicine production and supporting research, not diverting more space, more personnel and more resources to long-term waste management,” the spokesperson says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/14/home-secretary-suella-braverman-faces-legal-action-anti-protest-police-powers-liberty","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T13:08:51Z","webTitle":"Suella Braverman faces legal action after forcing through anti-protest powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/14/home-secretary-suella-braverman-faces-legal-action-anti-protest-police-powers-liberty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/14/home-secretary-suella-braverman-faces-legal-action-anti-protest-police-powers-liberty","fields":{"bodyText":"Human rights campaigners have begun legal action against the home secretary, Suella Braverman, after she forced draconian new police powers through parliament in a move described by the House of Lords as a “constitutional outrage”. Liberty wrote to Braverman on Wednesday, saying her move to empower police to curtail or restrict protests that caused “more than minor” disruption was unlawful. This week the government used secondary legislation, which is subject to less parliamentary scrutiny, to grant police the power. An attempt to include it as a late amendment to the recent Public Order Act 2023 failed to pass the Lords in January. Braverman told MPs on Wednesday the new powers would enable police to take quicker action against slow-walking protests and those that brought “chaos to the law-abiding majority”. But in its pre-action letter, the first step to a judicial review, Liberty said her move violated the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, because the measures had already been rejected by parliament. Katy Watts, a lawyer for the human rights organisation, said: “The home secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so. “This has been done deliberately in a way which enables the government to circumvent parliament – who voted these same proposals down just a few months ago – and is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers that exist in our constitution. “We’ve launched this legal action to ensure this overreach is checked, and that the government is not allowed to put itself above the law to do whatever it wants. It’s really important the government respects the law and that today’s decision is reversed immediately.” The Home Office confirmed it had received Liberty’s letter. A spokesperson said: “The right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority’s right to go about their daily lives. That is why have introduced a new definition of serious disruption, to give police the confidence they need to clear roads quickly. The was voted on by both the House of Commons and House of Lords, following proper parliamentary procedure.” The regulations, a response to daily roads protests by climate activists, lower the threshold for what constitutes “serious disruption” to the public from “significant” and “prolonged” to “more than minor”. One legal expert has suggested the change will give police “near total discretion” over which protests to allow and which to curtail. Liberty says the regulations now give police “almost unlimited powers” to stop protests Braverman said on Monday that the public had “lost their patience” with Just Stop Oil, the climate activist group that has staged 156 slow marches in London in the past six weeks. “The police must be able to stop this happening and it’s our job in government to give them the powers to do so,” she told the Commons as it passed the measure. But the use of secondary legislation to push through a rejected proposal has prompted accusations that the government is flouting democracy by playing fast and loose with constitutional laws. A cross-party committee of peers recently said it was the first time a government had tried such a move. Secondary legislation is law created by ministers under powers given to them by acts of parliament. It is used to fill in the details of acts, so they can be swiftly adapted to changing circumstances. But increasing use of secondary legislation to fill in so-called “skeleton bills” has led to concerns of a shift in power towards the executive. On Tuesday night, peers accused the Home Office of authoritarian and disreputable behaviour as they backed, by 177 votes to 141, a so-called regret motion proposed by Labour that criticised the process and urged the withdrawal of the provisions. Vernon Coaker, Labour’s home affairs spokesperson in the Lords, said: “It is an absolute fundamental constitutional outrage, what has actually taken place. Primary legislation was defeated. So what does the government do? It doesn’t bring forward new primary legislation; it tries to sneak through, in an underhand way, secondary legislation without proper public consultation. They undermine the workings of our parliamentary democracy and, as such, it is shocking.” A rare fatal motion brought by Jenny Jones of the Green party that aimed to kill off the regulations was defeated by 154 to 68. Labour had refused to back it, despite calls from Lady Jones and a 64,000-strong petition. The crossbench peer David Pannick KC also called the government’s move a constitutional outrage. The leading constitutional lawyer added: “All we can do … is express regret: we are very sorry about this. “Well, I express regret that the Labour frontbench is not prepared to see through the implications of its own view that this is a constitutional outrage. It is something that we should stand up against and vote against.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-14T12:00:11Z","webTitle":"‘I could have made the same money at McDonald’s’: the Power Rangers on fame, regrets and their shock reunion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/14/power-rangers-reunion-mighty-morphin-netflix","fields":{"bodyText":"In the mid 1980s, the Israeli-American media mogul Haim Saban was stuck in a Tokyo hotel with nothing to watch on TV. Until, that is, he came across five spandex-wearing masked superheroes battling outlandish rubber monsters – and decided to adapt Japanese show, Super Sentai, for US TV, as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. When its pilot made it to air in 1993, viewers were treated to an evil space witch escaping moon imprisonment to battle an android-assisted character who was simultaneously a wizard and a big head in a jar. There were giant mech robots known as Zords, plus the martial arts and acrobatic skills of their operators – “five teenagers with attitude”. Their grandiose hope? To save the Earth from the forces of evil – and hopefully keep the actors playing them away from the breadline. “I lived in an apartment with no furniture, I slept on the floor and used boxes to put my TV on,” says actor David Yost of his early days in Los Angeles before being cast as the Blue Power Ranger. Luckily, his time having almost nothing to his name only lasted three months. Once he started making a living from battling the space witch – AKA arch-villain Rita Repulsa – success was instant, if baffling. “We filmed 40 episodes, then once it aired, it became this thing we couldn’t explain,” he smiles. The stratospheric success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers outstripped anything that had been expected of it. The energising mash-up of Japanese action footage – where sparks shot out of the costumes anytime a ranger was struck – and campy, cheesy one-liners from the US-created script proved to be a hit with kids. Ratings were through the roof and toy sales quickly exceeded expectations. Fox ordered 20 more episodes, sending the production company, Saban Entertainment, scrambling for footage. The more episodes they created, the more ludicrous the onscreen antics ended up becoming. Jason Narvy, who played the slapstick comic relief character Skull, remembers “being dressed as an old woman for one scene, then an hour later running down the street with a small chimpanzee”. The absurdity of the show was not lost on him. He recalls one time both acting and serving as assistant director. “I’m in 18th-century British military regalia,” he says, “there’s a stunt guy dressed as a rat and ready to be hurled across a wire rig by an air cannon. I wave my sword to yell: ‘Action!’ That’s, like, Monty Python stuff.” Preposterous storylines and bizarre villains were all part of the appeal. Limited by the Japanese Sentai footage, Saban leaned into the wacky elements. “We had a lipstick monster; we fought a pachinko machine; we fought a turtle that had a stop light on its head,” says Yost. “The list goes on and on.” David Fielding, who played omnipotent recruiter Zordon, was tickled by the show’s villains, as he would often “walk into the recording booth and ask: ‘What monster are we fighting this week? The giant purse. Fantastic!’” Narvy says that “on any given day, some five-headed monster with 8,000 eyeballs would casually walk past you on the way to the set. Once we had a delivery guy dropping something off at the front desk. When one of these monstrosities walked past, he just stared at me, incredulous. I said, “Well, there’s something you don’t see everyday … Of course, I do.” However, in the years since it first broadcast, the show has faced criticism for its sometimes blatant racial stereotyping of the cast, such as the only Black actor being the breakdancing Black Ranger and the Asian cast member playing the Yellow Ranger. Yost, though, suggests that the show’s inclusion of different ethnic backgrounds on screen, fighting evil together, preceded a lot of racial representation that we see in kids’ TV today – particularly in terms of the depiction of Trini, the Yellow Ranger character, played by Thuy Trang. “It was a groundbreaking role,” he says. “And for Asian women especially, because they’re being represented and she was strong, powerful and a superhero.” Production was also famously problematic. Cast disputes about low pay reportedly affected filming, and eventually led to three of the cast quitting. (Walter Emanuel Jones, who played the Black Ranger, claimed: “I could have worked the window at McDonald’s and probably made the same money the first season.”) Safety issues stemming from it being a non-unionised production were also an issue according to Amy Jo Johnson, who played the original Pink Ranger. In a 2017 open letter in Variety she wrote that she “almost died a few times because of the makeshift low-budget stunts we performed”. Most notoriously, Yost has alleged that homophobia and harassment were behind his departure in 1996, having told NBC that it caused him to become suicidal. Although homophobia is not a topic he addresses during our interview, Yost does say that “as young actors, we were just signing contracts because you’re going to make more money than being a waiter.” The cast felt they were dispensable in the eyes of the production. “The person in charge was not a gracious person,” he says. “He was like: ‘If you don’t like it, you’ll be replaced. The kids don’t like you, they like the colours.’” Saban Entertainment would sell the franchise to Hasbro in 2018 for $522m (£419m). Power Rangers, though, has never really gone away, rotating its cast of superheroes every few years and becoming one of the world’s longest-running live-action kids’ TV shows. But now it’s attempting to pay homage to its roots with a worldwide, feature-length Netflix special. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always celebrates the 30-year anniversary of the brand, in a show that sees the return of Rita Repulsa alongside two of the original rangers: Yost, as the Blue Ranger Billy, and Walter Emanuel Jones, as the Black Ranger Zack. The Pink, Red and Yellow Rangers are from the second generation of cast members – who replaced the originals when they left – as not every previous actor was overjoyed at the idea of appearing. “Please stop saying I didn’t do [the] reunion because of money,” wrote Johnson on Twitter. “Simply not true. Maybe I just didn’t want to wear spandex in my 50s or couldn’t go to NZ for a month. Or none of ur beeswax,” she added. According to her, co-star Jason David Frank, who played the Green Ranger, Tommy, had also decided not to take part, prior to killing himself last November. “JDF &amp; I both chose not to for our own reasons. They filmed before he passed.” Trang died in a car accident in 2001, and Yost says the special is a tribute to the two original cast members lost since filming ceased. It is dedicated to Trang and Frank, with a particular attempt to honour Trang by introducing Charlie Kersh as Minh, the onscreen daughter of Trang’s Yellow Ranger character, Trini. Trini’s previous colleagues, Billy and Zack, take Minh under their wing and train her to become part of their troupe, in a plot that sees the heroes reunite to avenge the death of the Yellow Ranger. It also features a number of returning voice actors, locations and characters – including the musician behind the much-loved Go Go Power Rangers theme tune. It’s all very much in keeping with the tone of the original. “The word cheesy gets thrown around as though it’s a bad thing,” says Alwyn Dale who, along with Becca Barnes, is the head writer on the project. “But there’s a real joy to the tone of Power Rangers that has to be protected. The minute it becomes too serious or grimdark, there’s a real gut feeling that rejects that.” The project was kickstarted by Yost, who pitched it as an eight-part miniseries to Netflix a few years ago. In January 2023, he shared the script for the first two episodes on Twitter in the hope that “they would jump on [them] and develop [them] for the 30-year anniversary”. Citing legal issues, Netflix declined, instead offering Yost what became Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always. “I don’t want to use the word ‘consolation’,” he says, “but they said: ‘We can’t do that right now – we can create this special.’ It was a lot of work on their part to get from there to a shooting script. I gave my input and I think it turned out pretty good.” Given how much personal turmoil the franchise has previously caused Yost, you can’t help but wonder: why would he want to revisit it? Apparently, new owners Hasbro being happy to take the actors’ wellbeing seriously played a big part. “When we originally filmed, we didn’t have a lot of protections, we didn’t have health insurance,” says Yost. “I, being a young dumb Hollywood kid, got into a bar fight and got my nose broken in season one, so I’m walking around with a broken nose. I think at that point [Saban] realised ‘we should maybe give these kids a stipend, a certain amount of money that they can apply to getting health insurance’. That instance woke them up, but unfortunately never woke them up to deal with the union.” He finishes by saying, “I’m so grateful to Hasbro for listening to me, and taking it seriously to do this under the contracts and rules of the Screen Actors Guild Union – that’s the big difference.” Throughout its three-decade history, the Power Rangers franchise has entertained generation after generation of children, as well as generating billions in merchandise revenue. What makes it stand the test of time? Fielding thinks that many viewers were inspired by it to pursue specific careers, “like emergency medical technicians or firefighters, serving the general public”. Yost, meanwhile, holds that the show’s success is a testament “to the chemistry the original cast had together”. Narvy argues it is in its appeal to so many different kids: “At a time when superheroes were largely one type, one gender, one ethnicity, Power Rangers celebrated and empowered diversity. Kids saw themselves represented on screen.” Whatever its secret, with the new Netflix special it doesn’t look like ending any time soon. • This article was amended on 14 April 2023.

The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said on Thursday that Grossi had left the site after a visit that was delayed by several hours because of shelling, but that five International Atomic Energy Agency representatives would remain, probably until Saturday. “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here – let the world know that the IAEA is staying at Zaporizhzhia,” Grossi said in a video from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. He said explanations given to the 14-strong team during the visit, which lasted “a few hours”, were “very clear”. He praised the “dedicated work” of the plant’s staff who were “carrying on professionally with their work” in “very difficult circumstances”. The plant was occupied by Russian forces in March but is still connected to the Ukrainian grid and run by Energoatom employees. The area has come under repeated fire in recent weeks, sparking fears of a radiation disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded blame for the shelling, with Ukraine alleging Russia is using the plant as a shield, storing weapons there and launching attacks from the area around it, while Moscow accuses Ukraine of recklessly firing on the zone. Grossi’s comments came after both sides accused each other of trying to sabotage the IAEA visit, aimed at conducting “indispensable nuclear safety and security and safeguard activities”, delaying the mission by several hours. Enerhodar, the city beside the plant, came under fire at dawn, its mayor said, and Russian forces reportedly shelled the pre-agreed route the inspectors were meant to take. Moscow claimed to have thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to capture the plant. Grossi has said the inspection aimed to establish a permanent presence at the plant, but Russian officials had said the inspectors, wearing blue body armour and travelling in white armoured Land Cruisers with UN markings, would remain for just one day. Ukraine said it could not guarantee the team’s security. The energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, told CNN that Ukraine had “fulfilled its international obligations” and done all it could, but the situation around the plant remained “a mess”. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow was “doing everything” for the visiting inspectors “to be able to complete their tasks”. The Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, blamed Ukraine for any radiation danger. “The EU is busy with an important decision – whether or not to issue visas to Russians,” she added. “But radiation doesn’t need a visa to cross borders. If something happens at Zaporizhzhia, it will not be about visas, passports or borders.” Robert Mardini, the head of the international committee of the Red Cross, said it was time to “stop playing with fire” and instead protect the plant. “The slightest miscalculation could trigger devastation we will regret for decades,” he said. Mardini said it was encouraging that the IAEA team was inspecting the plant because the stakes were “immense … When hazardous sites become battlegrounds, the consequences for millions of people and the environment can be catastrophic and last many years.” Energoatom said early on Thursday that it had activated emergency procedures and shut down the facility’s No 5 reactor “as a result of another mortar shelling by Russian … forces at the site”. The operator said auxiliary diesel generators had been fired up at the plant’s non-operational reactor No 2 after a power supply line used for the plant’s own needs was damaged by the shelling, but it said unit No 6 “continues to work”. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, posted pictures of damaged buildings with smoke spiralling above them on the Telegram messaging app, saying Russian troops had been “shelling since dawn” with mortars, rockets and automatic weapons. Energoatom said the city had come under fire from the air. “A group of Russian K-52 attack helicopters worked over the city, striking residential areas,” it said, adding that one mortar attack struck “in the immediate vicinity” of the plant. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, accused Moscow of trying to wreck the inspection, saying Russia was acting like a terrorist state. “It is Russia that is responsible for everything happening at the plant and in Enerhodar,” he said. Moscow, meanwhile accused Kyiv – without evidence – of attempting to sabotage or recapture the Zaporizhzhia plant by sending in “up to 60 people on seven high-speed motor boats”. The IAEA mission was held up at a checkpoint in Novooleksandrivka, about 12 miles from the plant, early on Thursday. Oleksandr Starukh, the administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, accused Russian forces of “shelling the pre-agreed route”. Meanwhile, intensive fighting raged across the nearby Kherson region, most of which was seized by Russian forces at the start of the invasion six months ago and where Ukraine began a counteroffensive on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/08/leaders-of-amazon-nations-gather-in-brazil-for-summit-on-rainforests-future","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-08T20:14:22Z","webTitle":"Leaders of Amazon nations gather in Brazil for summit on rainforest’s future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/08/leaders-of-amazon-nations-gather-in-brazil-for-summit-on-rainforests-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/08/leaders-of-amazon-nations-gather-in-brazil-for-summit-on-rainforests-future","fields":{"bodyText":"The leaders of Amazon nations including Brazil, Colombia and Peru have gathered in the Brazilian city of Belém for a rare conclave about the future of the world’s largest rainforest amid growing concern over the global climate emergency. The environmental summit – convened by Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – represents a handbrake turn in Brazilian government policy after four years of Amazon destruction and international isolation under the country’s previous leader, Jair Bolsonaro. Those who have flown into Belém for the meeting include Bolivia’s president, Luis Arce, Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, Guyana’s prime minister, Mark Phillips, and Peru’s Dina Boluarte. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, pulled out at the last minute blaming an ear infection. The other members of the eight-country Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO), Ecuador and Suriname, have sent senior representatives. “This is a landmark moment,” Lula tweeted on Tuesday morning as his guests were shepherded to the talks by police motorcycle outriders. “What we are doing in defence of the Amazon and its population is historic.” At the summit’s opening session, Lula said the “severe escalation of the climate crisis” meant the need for regional cooperation was “more pressing than ever before”. As politicians began to arrive in the sweltering riverside city on Monday, Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, said: “We come here with the clarity … that the Amazon is drastically threatened … that we cannot allow it to reach a point of no return … and that it will be impossible to reverse this process if we work in isolation.” Among the issues to be discussed at ACTO’s first such meeting in 14 years are a possible deal to halt deforestation by 2030 and joint efforts to fight rampant illegal mining and the organised crime groups which are tightening their grip on the rainforest region. Colombia’s president has been pushing for an end to oil and gas exploration in the Amazon, although Brazilian moves to develop an oilfield near the mouth of the Amazon River complicate those efforts. A final communique, known as the Belém Declaration, is expected to be unveiled by ACTO members of at the end of the two-day meeting. Experts say it is likely to contain collaborative strategies for fighting deforestation and financing sustainable development initiatives, and the creation of a law enforcement centre in the Brazilian city of Manaus to promote cooperation among regional police forces. The challenges facing the group’s members are almost as immense as the Amazon itself – a sprawling 6.7m sq km region that, if it was a single country, would be the seventh largest on Earth. As well as nearly 50 million people, the region is home to an estimated 400bn trees belonging to 16,000 different species, more than 1,300 species of bird, tens of thousands of species of plant, and 20% of the world’s freshwater resources. It is also estimated to contain more than 120bn tonnes of carbon, making it a vital carbon sink. But over the past half-century, the advance of cattle ranching, logging, mining, soy farming and oil exploration has devastated huge swathes of the region, pushing it towards what scientists fear could be an irreversible tipping point which would cause the forest to die off. Transnational mafia groups have also expanded their footprint, with one senior Brazilian police chief recently warning “criminal insurgents” could commandeer parts of the Amazon with dire consequences for the rainforest and its inhabitants. In the days leading up to Tuesday’s summit, thousands of Indigenous activists gathered for a parallel summit in Belém to demand greater government support for their quest to defend the rainforest. The perils of such efforts were laid bare last year with the murders of British journalist Dom Phillips and the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira. Activists are also pushing for a pledge to protect 80% of the Amazon by 2025. Campaigners voiced a mix of relief that Lula had brought an end to Bolsonaro’s era of Amazon chaos, and anxiety that Brazil’s conservative-dominated congress might prevent the president from enacting his ambitious environmental agenda, which has already achieved a 42.5% drop in deforestation. “We know we have so many enemies in congress who don’t like us,” said Alessandra Korap, a leader of the Munduruku people. Korap urged Lula to oppose oil exploration in the Amazon and take a stand against highly controversial draft legislation that would invalidate Indigenous claims to lands such groups could not prove they occupied when Brazil’s 1988 constitution was enacted. “This would mean the death of our peoples,” Korap said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2022/dec/01/indonesian-group-first-asian-artists-to-top-power-list-after-antisemitic-mural","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T08:04:16Z","webTitle":"Indonesian collective at heart of antisemitism row top art world power list","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/01/indonesian-group-first-asian-artists-to-top-power-list-after-antisemitic-mural","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2022/dec/01/indonesian-group-first-asian-artists-to-top-power-list-after-antisemitic-mural","fields":{"bodyText":"An Indonesian collective that became embroiled in an antisemitism row earlier this year has taken the No 1 spot in the annual ranking of the contemporary art world’s most influential people and organisations. The ruangrupa group, founded in Jakarta in 2000, are the first artists from Asia to top the ArtReview Power 100. Their position “reflects the growing influence of the global south and the move towards greater diversity in the art world,” ArtReview said. The collective organised this year’s documenta, an important art exhibition that takes place every five years in Germany. The show was controversial and was accused of including antisemitic content. A large-scale outdoor mural that featured apparently antisemitic caricatures of Jews was removed days after the exhibition opened, and documenta’s general director, Sabine Schormann, resigned. In a statement posted online several days later, ruangrupa said: “The truth of the matter is that we collectively failed to spot the figure in the work, which is a character that evokes classical stereotypes of antisemitism. We acknowledge that this was our error.” ArtReview acknowledged that this year’s exhibition had been “continuously mired in controversy about racial and religious prejudice (antisemitism in particular)”. It prompted “heated debates about historical positions … that went all the way to government levels”. JJ Charlesworth, editor at ArtReview, said: “ruangrupa took the top position because their documenta offered a challenge to the established function of big art exhibitions and conventions of curating – conventions which still drive the Anglo-European art world and the European museum model. “Part of that is the question of the power of selection, control over who is included and excluded. Pursuing a more devolved, less top-down approach to exhibition-making, in which participants invited other participants in a kind of organisational daisy-chain, was always going to make controversy more likely. “But ruangrupa’s no 1 position is a recognition of the questions they ask about the institutions of the art world, not the debates provoked by a small number of works included in the exhibition.” This year’s Power 100 placed unions at No 3 after a wave of disruption at museums and galleries across the world. At No 8, photographer Nan Goldin had “notably instigated a profound shift in the ethics of museum patronage through her campaign to call to account the philanthropy of the Sackler family (closely tied to opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma)”. Museums and galleries around the world have removed the Sackler name from their buildings in the past year. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, at No 10, “steers a philanthropic organisation committing substantial financial resources to the art world’s social justice agendas”. The Top 10 also included Cecilia Alemani, the Italian curator described as a “disrupting influence” at the Venice Biennale; film-maker Hito Steyerl; cultural theorist Fred Moten; David Zwirner, owner of galleries in New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong; Turner prize-winning photographer Wolfgang Tillmans; and American artist Simone Leigh, the joint winner of the Golden Lion at this year’s Venice Biennale. Further down the list, Forensic Architecture came in at No 25. The collective “continues to expand the role art has in society beyond the exhibition space through its judicial investigations of social and environmental crimes”, said ArtReview. The Chinese visual artist Ai Weiwei was ranked at number 51 on the list. The list is chosen by more than 30 people from across the world, who remain anonymous. Last year, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) topped the list, and Black Lives Matter was No 1 the year before.

The government has pledged to peak emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2060, and in 2021 the president, Xi Jinping, promised to stop building coal powered plants abroad. But after regional power crunches in 2022, China started a domestic spree of approving new projects and restarting suspended ones. In 2022 the government approved a record-breaking 106 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant. This run of approvals is continuing, potentially on track to break last year’s record, according to analysis by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, published on Tuesday. It said in the first half of 2023, authorities granted approvals for 52GW of new coal power, began construction on 37GW of new coal power, announced 41GW-worth of new projects, and revived 8GW of previously shelved projects. It said about half of the plants permitted in 2022 had started construction by summer. The analysts said: “Unless permitting is stopped immediately, China won’t be able to reduce coal-fired power capacity during the 15th five-year plan (2026–30) without subsequent cancellations of already permitted projects or massive early retirement of existing plants.” Analysts have observed big advances in the renewable energy sector in China, which the government intends to make a mainstay of power supply, with coal in a supporting role. China is the world’s largest producer of renewable energy, including wind, solar and hydroelectricity. But previous analyses have found infrastructure to store and distribute has not kept pace. Shortfalls in interconnectivity between regional grids, and issues with power supply for some areas mean energy driven by fossil fuels remains crucial for supporting grid stability or integrating variable renewable energy sources. However, the report says many or most of the approvals being rushed through are not in areas with those issues. “Sixy per cent of new coal power projects are in grid regions where there is already an excess of coal-fired power capacity,” the report says. “The provinces adding large amounts of new coal-fired power are getting most of their added power generation from coal, contradicting the framing of coal power as a ‘supporting’ source for clean energy.” Cory Combs, an analyst at Trivium China, said authorities appeared to be prioritising uninterrupted demand and short-term economic recovery. “There is more development than there is need for development,” he said. “When we look at it from an energy security perspective, [provincial level governments] they are putting an extremely high premium on short-term energy security. I don’t mean systemic issues, [I mean] even making sure there’s not even a two-hour power shortage. That’s taken over everything else, including the financials, but certainly decarbonisation.” China is the world’s biggest carbon emitter, contributing almost a third of the world’s greenhouse gases in 2020. UN figures show that in terms of population size and number of environmental disasters, it is also extremely vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis. In its 14th five-year-plan, which ends in 2025, China’s government committed to reducing the latter by 65%, and raised the share of renewable fuels in primary energy consumption from 20% to 25%. Analysts have pointed to the power of the Chinese government to demand big change – another report out this week shows that Beijing’s “war on pollution” has had a significant impact, driving a decrease in global average pollution. While China’s air pollution is still six times higher than World Health Organization guidelines, it has reduced toxic air by 42.3% since 2013, which is forecast to result in an extra 2.2 years on the average life expectancy of a Chinese resident if the results are sustained. Combs said he was “really concerned” about the long-term impacts of the coal plant approvals apparently being made for short-term gain. Xi has promised to reduce coal consumption by the 2026-30 period, and Combs said China’s leadership was still standing by its targets, but this activity would put huge pressure on the later years of the window. “Xi’s credibility is largely tied to the 2030 goal. But some of the year-to-year thing I don’t take much stock in. They are overridden by other interests.” Additional research by Tau Yang • This article was amended on 29 August 2023 to clarify that Xi Jinping promised to stop building coal-powered plants abroad; and to correct the 2022 figure for government approved new coal-fired power capacity from 86GW to 106GW."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"80s hits and nuclear secrets: security concerns plague Trump’s Mar-a-Lago","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/20/donald-trump-maralago-nuclear-secrets-whitney-houston-security-flaws","fields":{"bodyText":"At a certain point in an average evening at Mar-a-Lago, the lights go down and the volume goes up, as the proprietor and former president of the United States turns DJ for the night. A member of the Mar-a-Lago private club said that following a period of withdrawal after his election defeat, Donald Trump has in recent months assumed the role of social ringmaster, deciding to bring a disco vibe to the Palm Beach resort after dark. “At about 9.30pm every night, he’s sitting at his table, whether on the patio or inside, and they bring a laptop over and he starts picking songs, and he starts being a DJ for the night, but it’s sort of funny because he picks like the same 10 songs every night,” the club member said. The Trump playlist is of a certain era, when he was a regular clubber in New York. The signature tune is the Village People’s YMCA, alongside The Greatest Love of All by Whitney Houston, and a few Elton John numbers. “Sometimes he dances to it,” the club member said. “He will be at his table and he’ll dance while sitting.” Towards the end of the evening, Trump will play a hymn, How Great Thou Art, which topped the charts when Elvis Presley sang it. It was a favorite of Trump’s father, Fred, a sentimental way of drawing a Mar-a-Lago soiree to a close. What might have otherwise seemed no more than a characteristically bizarre twist for a post-presidential career, looks more significant now that it is known that all the while the lights were low, the music was playing, guests were tipsy and the host was otherwise engaged, there were thousands of government documents, many of them highly sensitive, and at least one of them containing nuclear secrets, being kept illicitly in rooms and closets nearby. And all of this was unfolding in a venue described by former intelligence officials as a priority target for foreign spies. “Without any question the former president, and those in his circle will be very important targets for any foreign intelligence service. They will be looking at: how do we get into that circle?” said Douglas London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA’s clandestine service, and author of The Recruiter: Spying and the Lost Art of American Intelligence. London added: “He’s brought in really questionable people with various skeletons in their closets, financial or personal or political, who have vulnerabilities a foreign intelligence service could exploit.” It is a scenario which in other circumstances, might make for an uproarious comedy series, featuring spies from around the world tripping over each other in the dark as they race each other to grab hold of the motherlode of state secrets, as YMCA echoes around the darkened corridors. The setting is suitably flamboyant. When it was built in the 1920s for a cereal heiress, Marjorie Merriweather Post, the style of the 58-bedroom palace was described as Spanish-Moorish-Portuguese-Venetian. There are gargoyles that look like they were borrowed from medieval Britain. The original decor was chosen by a Viennese theatrical designer. When Trump bought it for $10m (£8.75m) in 1985, it had 58 bedrooms, an adjoining golf course and three bomb shelters. He said at the time he thought of the purchase as a “statement” rather than somewhere he could imagine living, but the high-end Floridian lifestyle grew on him and the place became his favourite home. In the 1990s, after a string of bankruptcies, he tried to squeeze desperately needed cash out of the property by trying to split it into plots, hold on to the main house, and sell the rest, but he was blocked by the local planning board. The board also tried to veto his plan B, turning the estate into a private club, but he was able to outmanoeuvre his opponents on the panel by assiduously cultivating individual members and pointing out publicly and embarrassingly that almost all the other clubs in Palm Beach did not admit Jews or Black people. There were few if any African Americans in the area who could afford the $100,000 (£87,454) initiation fee, which was doubled in 2017, but plenty of wealthy Jews, who had made their money in real estate and clothing. They became the bulk of the membership, the majority of them Democrats. When Trump succeeded Obama as president, and Mar-a-Lago became the “winter White House”, the ambience began to change. Trump had no time for the official presidential retreat at Camp David, which he saw as too rustic. Also the Trump Organization made no money from him staying there. Mar-a-Lago was another matter. The president saw no distinction between his personal life, his business and the public office, and Trump’s presidency became one of the club’s leading attractions. It was another label under the Trump brand. Paying guests were able to witness real-life scenes like Trump huddling with the then Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and his aides to hammer out a joint response to a North Korean missile test. In April 2017, Trump told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, about the missile strikes he had authorized in Syria while the leaders sat in the Mar-a-Lago dining room eating what the former president described as “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seen”. After Trump was defeated in 2020, he decamped to his Florida retreat, taking with him boxes full of secret documents and a new clientele. The crowd that hung around Trump International hotel in Washington followed him to Mar-a-Lago. “The club used to be serious money, serious players in business. Some really big players through the years have been members,” a longtime member reflected somewhat ruefully. “The new members of the club are a little bit Maga,” the veteran member said. “It’s very eclectic, a lot of foreigners, people that have made money in cryptocurrency, Oklahoma, fracking money. It looks more like the menagerie at the Trump Hotel in Washington.” Asked specifically about the foreigners, this member said: “A lot of different people there that they didn’t really have before. You’ll have Chinese people. You’ll have maybe some additional Arab people.” Even during the Trump presidency, there were significant holes in Mar-a-Lago’s security. Over the 2018 Thanksgiving holiday, a teenager, Mark Lindblom, slipped past guards and entered the club through a tunnel from the beach. Two Chinese women were caught trespassing. One of them, Yujing Zhang, had no fewer than four mobile phones, an external hard drive, as well as five sim cards and a “signal detector” gadget for locating hidden microphones or cameras. She was deported without any clarity on what she was doing there and why she was in possession of such an array of electronics. In the post-presidency, there are far fewer controls. “Typically once a president becomes former president, there’s a scale-back in resources at the Secret Service, but that really is something that doesn’t lend itself to the Mar-a-Lago environment because of the obvious threats there,” said Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence. Each year the club hires 80 to 90 foreign workers. They at least get vetted, but that is no guarantee against an insider threat, Figliuzzi said “The fact that four years ago, the Secret Service vetted the guy who serves Trump Diet Coke 12 times a day, doesn’t mean that that guy is invulnerable to a $200,000 [£174,936] payment from a foreign intelligence agency,” he said. The problem of the club members and their guests is far greater. “Who are these members? Who’s vetting them?” Figliuzzi asked. “If you have the requisite money and you plunk it down, it appears you’re a member. And now here come your family members and guests and their cousins and their in-laws. And is it really possible for the Secret Service to even begin to think that they could vet the guest side of the house?” All this helps explain why a Russian-speaking Ukrainian-born woman called Inna Yashchyshyn was able to mingle with club members and Trump himself in the spring and summer of 2021, posing as Anna de Rothschild, a Monaco-bred scion of the banking family. Whether Yashchyshyn, and the two Chinese interlopers, were just opportunists or connected to something more sinister, remains unknown. But then the same could be said of much of the Mar-a-Lago crowd, especially the new arrivals. But perhaps the biggest question mark is hanging over the resort’s wounded and vengeful owner and DJ. No one knows what plans he had for his stolen trove of state secrets. “Whatever he selected was because he had some intent to do something with it,” London said. “The question mark is: what were his intentions? But none of it is going to be a happy story. None of it is going to end well, in terms of the impact on national security.” • This article was amended on 20 September 2022.

British officials at the G7 foreign ministers’ summit in Japan said they were expecting Russia to retaliate and “must be prepared” for extreme tactics as it attempted to hold on to Ukrainian territory. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said last month that Moscow was ready for the Ukrainians to hit back, warning that his country would use “absolutely any weapon” if Kyiv attempted to retake Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. There appeared to be an acknowledgment in Moscow that its forces might soon find themselves on the defensive in Ukraine as Russia’s own winter offensive appeared to be slowing down. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric has united the G7 ministers, who issued a statement after their two-hour meeting on Monday condemning the threats as “unacceptable” and criticising Putin’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. G7 officials said there was an “open exchange of views” in the talks on the approach to the Ukrainian conflict, including on “future prospects” for bringing the war to an end, which Rishi Sunak has said would eventually be around the negotiating table. However, Foreign Office sources suggested that the only way to finally resolve the conflict would be for Putin to withdraw his troops from Crimea and for the west to give Kyiv the tools to finish the job. Despite pressure from Ukraine, and others including the former UK prime minister Boris Johnson, to increase military support – including more tanks and fighter jets – the UK believes it is providing what the country needs. Sources said it was already committing its “rainy day fund”. A transatlantic group of former senior diplomats and high-level military advisers said on Monday that the war in Ukraine was on course to become a stalemate unless the west went “all in” and increased its level of military support. The group said that “declarations of unwavering support” were not enough and “actions still fail to match the rhetoric” in a reflection of military assessments in European capitals and Washington. At the G7 summit, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to “intensifying, fully coordinating and enforcing” sanctions against Russia, agreeing to be more coordinated to prevent evasion of the measures and to target third parties supplying weapons to Moscow. It came as the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, demanded the release of a British-Russian opposition leader after he was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a court in Moscow, paying tribute to Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr for “bravely” denouncing Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The Kremlin critic, who has twice survived poisonings, was convicted on charges of treason and denigrating the Russian military in what he denounced as a show trial. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on Monday over Russia’s human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s G7 bilateral talks with his French counterpart, Catherine Colonna, over-ran, prompting speculation her talks with the US had been fraught. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, provoked controversy last week when he said, on a flight back from China, that Europe should not become a “vassal” to the US on foreign policy. He had previously been accused of naivety when he said Moscow must not be “humiliated” and would need security guarantees. G7 officials stressed that all member nations, including France, were united on the need to prevent Putin’s attempts to divide and conquer. Eastern European governments, in particular, had accused Macron of failing to learn the lessons of the war. Without US military and financial support for Kyiv, more than 30 times that of France, Ukrainian resistance would have already crumbled, they believe. In separate talks in Japan, G7 nations including UK, US, Canada, Japan and France formed an alliance to develop shared supply chains for nuclear fuel, aimed at pushing Russia out of the international nuclear energy market. The UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the five countries would use their civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains, cutting off another means for Putin to fund his invasion of Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-30T06:30:41Z","webTitle":"Girl power: Colombia’s first female electrical line workers train to keep the lights on","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2022/dec/30/colombia-first-female-electrical-line-workers","fields":{"bodyText":"Marianela Hernández Valencia knows what life without electricity is like. “As a child, I grew up in a house without electricity, which meant having to do homework by candlelight,” she says. “It was difficult.” Today, the 28-year-old is among 15 women hoping to graduate as one of Colombia’s first-ever intake of apprentice linewomen, in La Ceja, a small town about 40km southeast of Medellín, Colombia’s second-largest city. Line workers scale towers and transmission lines hundreds of feet above the ground to install and repair power cables. They are often the first responders after a storm or natural disaster and are regularly away from home for long periods. Kitted out with belts and safety harnesses, the first apprentice linewomen gather around the teachers for a motivational talk before training Graduates of the year-long pilot project, led by ISA, Latin America’s largest energy transmission company, with the training group Tener Futuro Corporation, are guaranteed a job with one of two contractors, Instelec and Salomón Durán. Students are taught about safety, rigging and knot tying, all in a hands-on environment. As more companies seek to diversify the workplace, it may seem there has never been a better time for women to enter the trade. Yet, few consider applying. The organisers of the scheme aim to change that by targeting the apprenticeships solely at women and providing a safe space for them to learn. A week after the call went out for female applicants, 723 had registered interest. A trainee fixes a porcelain insulator in place, to prevent live wires from coming into contact with each other or the utility pole. A line worker typically carries between 9-13.5kg (20-30lbs) on their belt “I’ve always been drawn to electrical work,” says Hernández Valencia, who once worked as an electrician’s assistant. “That feeling you get when you’re able to help switch the light back on and seeing the kids’ faces light up – it’s indescribable.” She was working as a restaurant administrator in Medellín when her partner – a lineman – told her about the recruitment drive. Her application was successful, but two weeks into the apprenticeship, her partner dealt an unexpected blow. “For the first few weeks when we arrived, we overlapped with another group of trainees – men – and my partner wasn’t happy about it. Having first insisted I sign up, he was suddenly telling me to choose between him and the training,” she says. “I chose to continue training.” Apprentices during their training. At the end of the course all graduates are guaranteed a job Hernández Valencia’s refusal to give up her course and the subsequent breakdown of her relationship have made her all the more determined. Her teachers say she is an outstanding student, and is emerging as a group leader. While the public has been mostly supportive of the trainee linewomen, some online comments have been critical, some sexist. “In Colombia, we have very complex cultural egos,” says Claudia Laguna, an engineer and ISA’s corporate projects specialist, who thought up the project. “Women are very capable but they’ve always been relegated.” It is more than 10 years since Colombia achieved 95% electrical coverage, but access for the most remote areas is difficult. In 2020, an estimated 1.9 million Colombians still lacked access to electricity. About 2,500 line workers are active, and an estimated 500 more are needed to keep up with electrification demands; there are plans to build between 1,200 and 2,500km of new power lines by 2025. Two months into the training, most students have conquered their fear of heights, but the art of moving along a cable takes time to master Clockwise: The offices and lodges of the Catholic University of the East, where the training camp for linewomen is based; students learn how to tie specific knots, as well as the proper use of various ropes, slings, block and tackle; tools of the trade; At 5pm after receiving feedback, the women retire to their rooms to catch up with loved ones Trainees aged from 17 to 31 receive a stipend and boarding. For those who stay the course, an opportunity to travel also beckons. But it does not come without sacrifice. Most of the women are mothers who may have had to make difficult decisions about childcare. Diana Lizeth Lizarazo Moreno started the programme when her youngest was 18 months old. When her grandmother died, she was given special dispensation to return home for the funeral. “My daughter didn’t recognise me. In no time at all, she had grown attached to my sister,” she says. “That’s hard, but at least I know that she is in good hands.” Mother of two Diana Lizeth Lizarazo Moreno and Jessica Osorio, 23, who suspended her studies in biotechnology The training is challenging. On any given day, line workers typically carry between 9kg and 13.5kg on their belt alone. But the women have qualities beyond strength, says Laguna, “like attention to detail and ensuring safe outcomes”. Mental stamina is key. “You need to be able to keep a cool head, especially when something unexpected happens and you’re high up a tower,” says Lizarazo Moreno. La Ceja’s high altitude, combined with scaling tens of metres and carrying heavy equipment, can sometimes lead to dizzy spells All the women on the course reported that they had grown in confidence. “You need confidence in yourself, but also in your team,” says Jessica Osorio, 23, who was a year away from completing a biotechnology engineering degree when she decided to suspend her studies. “[I] wanted to do something out of my comfort zone and it turns out I love this work.” A shattered mobile displays a memory from back home. Spending a long time away from loved ones is one reason some apprentices drop out With a month left before the first stage of the training, just 15 of the original 30 women remain. “A number of candidates failed the medical test. Once we selected the final 30, a combination of factors all played a part, from suddenly being faced with the reality of having to leave your home and family – in many cases, children – to struggling with logistics and childcare, as well as self-doubt and dealing with other people’s opinions. It’s been a learning curve,” says Laguna. But the sector is committed to opening itself up to women, with three cohorts of 20 women planned for 2023, she says. “Ultimately, it’s about creating a virtuous chain, and the belief is that by supporting these women now, you help establish the foundations for creating sustainable value moving forward.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T15:58:58Z","webTitle":"Cynical Tories can’t understand the power of compassion and community | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/oct/14/cynical-tories-cant-understand-the-power-of-compassion-and-community","fields":{"bodyText":"During the Covid pandemic, I worked as a Catholic chaplain in an NHS hospital.

The strong ties that we built during the pandemic are being threatened by the rhetoric of the prime minister and her cabinet. She is behaving like the worst of tyrants, encouraging communities to look for the enemy within. This is disgraceful behaviour. It is so sad that she seeks to highlight the divisions in society, rather than calling for us all to work together, to make our communities safe, prosperous and happy once again. Josephine Feeney Leicester • The opinion pieces in last Saturday’s paper revealed just how ideological and fantastical Tory policy really is. I would like to suggest that Conservative ministers come and spend some time in towns and cities like mine, not just on a flying “here today, gone tomorrow” visit, but as members of the community. Were they to come to Newport, I would like to introduce them to the teachers who give substantially to their in-house food schemes out of a sense of vocational responsibility; the churches and other civic groups that run school uniform banks, breakfast clubs and night shelters; the Mind charity groups that try to provide struggling people with a little peace and quiet for a few hours a week; the outreach schemes that feed the homeless on the streets, and so many more. I would like to show members of the government what dignity, compassion and community look like in practice. I would like to introduce them to the poor helping the poor, and I would like to remind them that the rights and freedoms that some of them now enjoy were won in cities like mine. But above all, I would like to show them how compassion trumps ideology every time. Canon Andrew Lightbown Newport Cathedral • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

After a £9bn investment by Malaysia-backed developers and more than a decade of restoration, the doors to the almost century-old decommissioned power station opened on Friday for the first time in 40 years. The space has been transformed into a glitzy shopping centre of 250 stores, alongside mostly luxury flats, office spaces and an upcoming cinema and ice rink. After the grand opening, a five-day free festival of live music will take place on the site. Emma and Marcus Liberman, a married couple from north-west London, decided to travel down for the centre’s opening after decades of speculation regarding what would become of the former industrial station. “When we first came to London, there were plans for redeveloping the power station about 30 years ago, but it never came to anything,” Marcus said. “And I’ve always looked to this amazing building, and wanted to see what it was really about, so just really wanted to come and see it.” He added: “It’s just really exciting to see it actually turned it something, being used and full of life again, as opposed to a rather sad looking, deteriorating building.” Bernice Ondebola, a 67-year-old retired nurse who has lived in Battersea for most of her life, said the new development was a “lovely sight” compared with the abandoned and derelict former station. “I grew up in south London, and have been living not too far away from the power station for the past 35 years,” Ondebola said. “In some ways the area is so unrecognisable compared to when I first started living here, with, you know, all the new flats and also the new tube. But I think the shopping centre is nice because it has a bit of everything for everyone.” Ondebola said she especially liked how the centre, despite its modernisation, has retained many of its period features. “You can really feel that you’re inside the power station, with all the exposed brick and the machinery you can see on the ceiling,” she ssaid. “The building has such a big presence in our local area so it’s nice that it has become a place that everybody can use.” Serge, a 52-year-old business owner and who has lived in London for the past 30 years, said that watching the power station transform from an abandoned building had been momentous. “I’ve seen the station abandoned, and the whole surroundings at that time wasn’t very pleasant-looking. It’s very nice to see somebody invested in the area and moved the whole project ahead”, he said. Although most people attending the opening were positive about the redevelopment, there was some concerns raised about the lack of affordable housing provided – at just 386 homes, a 40% reduction from the original plans. Alice White, a 25-year-old student, was at first sceptical when she heard of the power station’s redevelopment plans. “I know there was a lot of debate about how many of the new flats inside the station would actually be affordable,” White said. But despite still having some reservations regarding the development, White thought the centre was “quite enticing”. “I can’t lie, the range of shops and places to eat here are kind of exciting,” White adds. “I live locally, and what I’m most happy about is not having to go all the way to Westfield or Oxford Street whenever I need to make some returns at Zara.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T17:26:30Z","webTitle":"West makes plans to avoid panic if Russia uses nuclear bomb in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/14/west-plans-avoid-panic-if-russia-nuclear-bomb-ukraine-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"Western officials are engaged in “prudent planning” behind the scenes to prevent chaos and panic in their home countries in the event Russia was to detonate a nuclear bomb in or near Ukraine. Although a nuclear crisis is considered highly unlikely, the insider said officials internationally were re-examining plans to provide emergency support and reassurance to populations fearful of nuclear escalation. Hints of the thinking emerged in a briefing by an official on Friday, who was asked if there would be measures in place to prevent panic buying or people fleeing cities en masse in fear of escalation after a nuclear event. Governments were engaged in “prudent planning for a range of possible scenarios” said the western official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, although they stressed that any use of nuclear weapons by Russia in the war would be abhorrent. Public information campaigns and even school drills on how to survive a nuclear war were a feature of the cold war, including the duck and cover campaign in the US in the 1950s, Protect and Survive from the UK in the late 1970s and “Everyone has a chance” in West Germany in the early 1960s. These campaigns were the subject of considerable criticism and parody for their suggestion that it could be possible to survive an all-out nuclear conflict, although in this case the focus is supposed to be on preventing public panic over fear of an uncontrolled nuclear escalation that would lead to major cities being targeted. Kate Hudson, the general secretary of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: “This ‘prudent planning’ harks back to the British government’s cold war-era Protect and Survive campaign – which was roundly condemned by CND as giving the false impression that a nuclear attack could be survived by whitewashing windows and other irrelevances.” As Moscow has suffered reverses on the battlefield in Ukraine since September, Vladimir Putin has ratcheted up the nuclear rhetoric, saying last month that he would use “all available means” to defend Russian territory. The western official said the Russian president’s comments about nuclear use were “deeply irresponsible” and no other country was talking about nuclear weapons. “We do not see this as a nuclear crisis,” they said. Echoing comments made by the US, the official said: “Any use of nuclear weapons would break a taboo that has held since 1945” which would “lead to severe consequences for Russia, as well as for everybody else”. Towards the end of last month, Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, said there would be “catastrophic consequences” for Moscow if it sought to deploy a tactical nuclear weapon, which can have the power of six or seven Hiroshima blasts. The west does not want to spell out how it might respond, to preserve a deliberate ambiguity – and on Friday the official would not be drawn on what nuclear armed countries might do. But the expectation is that to avoid rapid escalation any initial response would be non-nuclear. On Thursday, Emmanuel Macron broke ranks and said he would not order a like-for-like retaliation if there was a Russian nuclear strike in Ukraine. The French president said the country’s fundamental interests “wouldn’t be directly affected at all if, for example, there was a ballistic nuclear attack in Ukraine, in the region”. Earlier this week, Jeremy Fleming, the head of the GCHQ spy agency, said he not seen any sign that Russia was preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine. It is his agency’s job to help monitor Russian military movements, and whether its military was trying to pair a nuclear warhead with a conventional missile. Experts generally believe that Putin is engaged in a bluff, trying to provoke fear and uncertainty in the west, to ensure that the US or Nato does not enter the war on Ukraine’s side."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T12:30:37Z","webTitle":"Erik ten Hag confident Manchester United have enough goal power ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/oct/14/erik-ten-hag-confident-manchester-united-have-enough-goal-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Erik ten Hag is confident Manchester United have forwards who will score 20 or more league goals this season but the manager also wants his midfielders and defenders to contribute. Marcus Rashford’s five goals in nine games is United’s highest tally, with Antony, Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho each scoring three times and Cristiano Ronaldo twice. United’s only other scorer is Bruno Fernandes, who has one strike in 12 appearances. Ten Hag, asked whether he has players who can score at least 20, said: “Yes, I’m confident, mostly. In my team, there are players who will score. They come into the [scoring] position and in the last part [of the field]. It’s also about the freedom from the player, the intuition, the space they have to take. When they have that feeling then you will see that with their talent they will score that number. “You can also divide it, because we have many goalscorers across the offensive department. But we also need something from midfield and the defensive department.” Rashford’s buildup play sparkled in Thursday’s 1-0 Europa League victory against Omonia Nicosia though his finishing disappointed. “He did a lot of things well but finally he knows that he has to be more clinical and he has to score a goal,” Ten Hag said. “When you have such good movements and make such good combinations, good actions, then you have to finish. I know sometimes it’s the game, it’s not your night and it’s about the form of the day but it can change in another game. “He’s in a really good run, that shows in the chances he creates. Now it’s in the last two games he’s been a little unlucky. On Sunday [at Everton] he deserved a goal but they cancelled it [for a handball]; today he didn’t score. I say save it for the coming week.” United host Newcastle on Sunday, then Tottenham on Wednesday before Saturday’s visit to Chelsea. “These are real tests for us as a squad to go into battle,” Ten Hag said. “And it delivers energy. Newcastle do really well. It’s a team who can play in high intensity with a lot of energy and that makes it a tough opponent. We know we have to play our best.” In midfield Ten Hag can choose from Scott McTominay, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Fred. He is yet to settle on his best combination. “It’s difficult to say in this moment,” he said. “They have to play longer together but what’s important is that we need a squad. Fred played a good game [against Omonia]. We have some combinations and in the midfield it’s always about balance. I’m happy with all four and hope they keep going this way.” Martial faces a fitness test but Harry Maguire’s hamstring requires more time to heal. “Next week he’ll be back in training or after next week,” said Ten Hag."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
