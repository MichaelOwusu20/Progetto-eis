The Chinese president stressed the need for greater cooperation between China and Germany in what he referred to as “times of change and turmoil”, and said both leaders “jointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,” although he stopped short of criticising Russia or calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops. The German chancellor said Russia was in danger of “crossing a line” in the international community if it used atomic weapons, in what was the first meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Scholz’s inaugural one-day visit on Friday was the first by a leader of a G7 nation to China in three years, and was viewed as testing the waters of relations between Beijing and the west after years of mounting tensions, analysts say. Observers said Scholz’s visit was being viewed in China as a welcome development as the country’s leadership looks to consolidate its relations with the outside world after years of isolation during the pandemic. For his part, Scholz was looking to achieve greater market access at a time when the German economy is struggling with inflation and an imminent recession, largely fuelled by the energy crisis. Scholz defended his decision to travel to China with a group of industrial representatives, which has been viewed with controversy at home, telling journalists: “It is good and right that I am in Beijing today.” He said in time of crisis, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bilateral meetings were all the more important. In a meeting with China’s outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, Scholz said he had urged Xi to use China’s influence as a permanent member of the UN security council on Russia to bring an end to the invasion of Ukraine. “I told president Xi that it is important for China to exercise its influence on Russia,” he said. During their meeting, which was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said that as large nations with influence, China and Germany should work together all the more during “times of change and turmoil” for the sake of world peace, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. “As long as the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, exchanges and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation are upheld, the general direction of bilateral relations will not be deviated, and the pace of progress will be stable,” Xi was quoted as saying by CCTV. “At present, the international situation is complex and changeable. As influential powers, China and Germany should work together in times of change and chaos to make more contributions to world peace and development.” Over lunch Scholz told Xi it was important both leaders were meeting in person during tense times, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine creating problems for the rules-based global order, according to a Reuters reporter accompanying Scholz’s delegation. At a news conference after his meeting with Li, Scholz said he had raised the issue of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory over which it will not exclude using weapons in order to bring it under its control. “Like the US and other countries, we are pursuing a one-China policy,” he said. “But I have made equally clear that any change in Taiwan’s status quo must be peaceful or by mutual consent.” The two leaders also discussed Europe-China relations, the climate crisis and global hunger, as well as how to develop China-Germany economic ties, which Scholz said had “become more difficult for German companies recently” because of China sealing off access to many of its market sectors. Li nominally has responsibility over China’s economy. According to German media who accompanied him, Scholz indirectly admonished China over its failures to protect minorities in China. He told Xi that human rights were universal, especially the rights of minorities and pledged to “want to remain in discussion” with China about the situation in the province of Xinjiang, which is allegedly home to hundreds of interment camps in which more than 1 million Uyghurs are believed to be held. China’s strict zero-Covid policy and growing tensions with the west have made it unfeasible for leaders of major western powers to visit China. Xi himself has only just resumed foreign trips. Scholz’s visit is probably a welcome development for China’s leadership, which will be looking to shore up relations with the outside world after the conclusion of the 20th party congress, where Xi consolidated his status as the core of the ruling Communist party. In the run-up to the visit, there had been criticism from within the EU and the German government coalition, mainly from the Green party and the Liberals.

She recalls standing on stage at her north Wales convent school reciting a poem and “in that moment feeling transported to another realm of existence. I remember thinking: ‘I prefer it here.’ The reality is that I still feel that way. As much as I love my life, I do prefer to be in the realm of the imagination. It is the place where I am my truest self.” Scanlan, who is 61, is installed in a meeting room at her publicist’s office in Soho, London. It has been a long morning of interviews, but if she is tired of talking she is too nice to show it; her default setting is sunny and self-effacing. She is here to discuss The Light in the Hall, a psychological thriller set in Carmarthenshire which has been shot in English and Welsh (Scanlan learned her lines with the help of her Welsh-speaking niece). She plays Sharon, whose teenage daughter, Ela, was murdered 18 years ago. A local gardener, Joe Pritchard (Game of Thrones’ Iwan Rheon) was convicted of the crime, but never revealed why he did it or what he did with the body. When he is released on parole, Sharon determines to find out what happened to her child. Researching the role, Scanlan read a series of victim personal statements in murder cases, where relatives of the dead explain how the crime has affected them. “They are the most gut-punching pieces of writing I think I’ve ever read,” she says. “This isn’t dialogue from a TV drama or a novel. This is people’s lives. They are there as a voice for the lost life, and the continual loss of life that is played out within a family when a person is killed.” The series delves deep into the notion of truth and how it can become warped when a crime is committed. Scanlan has first-hand experience of this, having witnessed the assault of a male friend in a pub when she was a student. A man passing their table had knocked his pint to the floor, seemingly on purpose, and a fight ensued. Her friend was so badly beaten that he had to go to hospital, and Scanlan made a police statement. A few months later, she was called to give evidence in court. “I was sitting outside waiting to be called in and there was a bloke sitting beside me who was the weediest-looking guy imaginable,” she says. “I thought he was one of the solicitor’s team. But then our representative came out and asked if I wanted to re-read the statement I had made on the night of the crime. So I read it and there, in my own words, was a perfect description of the man who had been sitting beside me.” Scanlan lets out a horrified laugh. “So, in the gap between the guy punching my friend and me being hauled into court to give evidence, I had reimagined this bloke as fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger!” In court, Scanlan learned more about the perpetrator and found herself feeling sympathy for him: he had a young family and had recently lost his job. “I mean, the incident shouldn’t have happened,” she says, “but I had made so many internal judgments about the perpetrators of crime, and I had mapped that on to the reality we were now looking at. So, in playing Sharon, this question of how we judge perpetrators of crime, and what contexts and mitigation there may be, was strong in my mind.” The Light in the Hall is Scanlan’s first major role since winning a Bafta for best leading actress in After Love, Aleem Khan’s film which cast her as a widow from Dover who discovers her late husband, a ferry captain, had a secret family in Calais. The film critic Mark Kermode described her performance as “a masterclass in the dramatic power of understatement”. On picking up her award, Scanlan said: “Some stories have surprise endings, don’t they?” “Well, I really had surprised myself,” she says now. “For a start, I had never imagined playing a leading role. But I also started acting very late – I didn’t perform professionally until I was 35 – so I’ve always had this sense of running to catch up. If someone said to me now that they were thinking of becoming an actor in their mid-30s, I’d probably say: ‘That boat may well have sailed.’” Since her breakout role as Terri, the put-upon civil servant in The Thick of It, Scanlan has rarely wanted for work: she has played a ward sister in the hospital sitcom Getting On (which she also co-wrote); an exasperated detective in Paul Abbott’s No Offence; a mother superior in Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat’s Dracula; and a cheerful farmer’s wife in The Larkins. Still, she has lost count of the projects she has been involved with that never got off the ground or simply failed to capture viewers’ imaginations. “There’s a lot of snakes and ladders in this game. You do something wonderful and then – bam! – it’s cancelled. So in that sense, the surprise of getting a Bafta was real. Here I was standing on stage as a leading lady being honoured by my peers. I still think to myself: ‘Did that really happen?’” It was, famously, a doctor who persuaded Scanlan to pursue acting. Prior to that, she had worked at Leicester’s De Montfort University and, later, at the Arts Council. At 29, she was signed off work following a bout of depression and extreme fatigue. The doctor in question asked her whether she had ever wanted to do anything else with her life. When she said she had wanted to act, he told her: “If you don’t do this, you will be ill for the rest of your life.” His words were “like an arrow going straight into my sternum. I didn’t doubt him at all.” Scanlan describes her early childhood as “idyllic”: she grew up in rural Cheshire “surrounded by animals and no people” and spent most of her time outdoors. “That time spent finding fairy rings, jumping over rivers, being stung by nettles 100 times a day; I think my inner self was forged in that landscape.” When she was 13, her parents bought a hotel in Ruthin, north Wales. Throughout her teens, she worked every job going: cleaner, waitress, bartender, receptionist. “Hotels are much like theatres in that everyone is playing a role,” she says. “I would stand behind the bar polishing glasses and eavesdropping on people’s lives. I found them totally absorbing and I learned so much about people, which clearly fed into what I do now.” And what of her career now, as a Bafta-winning actor? No Offence writer Abbott said recently that Scanlan was “about to go ballistic. We’ll see her disappearing off into Netflix and Hollywood now.” She looks thoughtful when I mention this. “It’s a strangely stratified world, our industry, and awards mean you get on new lists. I have always put excellence and creativity first, and I’ve been lucky enough that around 80% of what I’ve done has been really good. But now I’m in this luxurious position of being considered a leading actor, and that is tremendously exciting.” It is different, she adds, when you have a supporting part, which means “you’re just in and out [on set]. What comes with a leading role is that sense of responsibility for the whole. You’re there with the crew from beginning to end, and there’s something about that that suits me.” While sitting in a taxi early this morning, Scanlan found herself idly thinking about the kind of roles she hasn’t yet done, but would like to. “I have always played people who are under the radar,” she reflects. “I get packaged as quite ordinary. So I would really like to harness my power. I don’t think I’ve played many characters with real welly. I feel like there is this rageful power [in me] that could be quite compelling that hasn’t been unleashed. But now I think I’m ready.” The Light In the Hall is on Channel 4 from 4 January at 9pm and streams on All 4."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:38:35Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant funding approved despite Tory split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson has approved funding for a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk in the final weeks of his premiership, but some of Liz Truss’s senior allies are split over the decision. The prime minister and the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, approved financing for the construction of two new reactors known as Sizewell C, enabling private funding of about £20-30bn to be raised. However, Simon Clarke, another key Truss ally and a Treasury minister, warned in a letter leaked to the Sunday Times that the decision could limit Truss’s economic vision. In the letter, he said the costs of Sizewell C were “sufficient to materially affect spending and fiscal choices for an incoming government, especially in the context of wider pressures on the public finances”. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Kwasi Kwarteng stressed the need to “crack on with more nuclear power stations” in order to increase Britain’s energy security. He gave development consent for Sizewell C in July, but negotiations over the government’s investment decision had been ongoing. A Whitehall source said Boris Johnson had taken the decision to press ahead with Sizewell several weeks ago. However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible. “In the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project’s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it’s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.” Johnson’s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built. A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: “Whatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision? “Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money than on a project that won’t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.” Truss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China’s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: “I think it’s very important that we don’t become strategically dependent and I think it’s important that we make sure that we’re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.” EDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-20T07:00:30Z","webTitle":"MacBook Pro M2 Pro review: Apple’s best laptop gets more power and battery life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/20/macbook-pro-m2-pro-review-apples-best-laptop-gets-more-power-and-battery-life","fields":{"bodyText":"Apple’s M2 Pro chip upgrade for the MacBook Pro boosts performance and battery life in an already extremely capable machine – but it comes with a sizable price increase, making it particularly expensive outside the US. The starting price is £2,149 ($1,999/A$3,199), which is £250 (A$200) more than its predecessor despite being the same price in the US, which is partly down to weak currency rates. It is not as if the 2021 model was cheap, but pushing beyond the £2,000 mark for the new version significantly raises the barrier to entry. The outside of the machine remains untouched, with the winning combination of a brilliant fast, sharp and super-bright screen, class-leading keyboard and trackpad, a reasonable selection of ports and a premium look and feel befitting of its price. It was excellent in 2021 and remains so today. It runs macOS 13.2 Ventura like all recent Macs, including its desktop stablemate, the Mac mini. It generally runs similarly to previous versions and not too different to Windows, but has useful screen-sharing and proximity features, allowing you to use a recent iPad as a second screen or control it remotely. You can use an iPhone as a wireless webcam, which works really well but is less necessary because the FaceTime HD camera on the MacBook Pro is pretty good already. Specifications Screen: 14.2in mini LED (3024x1964; 254 ppi) ProMotion (120Hz) Processor: Apple M2 Pro or M2 Max RAM: 16, 32, 64 or 96GB Storage: 512GB, 1, 2, 4 or 8TB SSD Operating system: macOS 13.2 Ventura Camera: 1080p FaceTime HD camera Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, 3x USB 4/Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, SD card, headphones Dimensions: 221.2 x 312.6 x 15.5mm Weight: 1.6kg M2 Pro is faster and more efficient The new M2 Pro chip offers decent performance gains on the already very fast M1 Pro chips, with up to 14% improvement in CPU speed and up to 22% faster graphics in tests. That puts it alongside some of the best Intel and AMD laptop chips, but at considerably lower power consumption. The M2 Max chip is also available for those who need more graphics or power for specialist applications. Fitted with the M2 Pro, the laptop lasted about 10% longer on battery than its predecessor in my testing, managing more than 15 hours of light work such as word processing or browsing and about 12 hours of more demanding tasks such as editing batches of large images in Affinity Photo. That’s thoroughly impressive, outlasting all rivals by some margin. The battery reaches a full charge in just under 90 minutes, hitting 50% in about 30 minutes using Apple’s included 96W USB-C charger and MagSafe cable, but it can also charge via any of the USB ports. Sustainability The MacBook Pro is made of 30% recycled materials, including aluminium, rare earth elements, tin, gold and plastic. Apple breaks down the computer’s environmental impact in its report. The computer is generally repairable and has repair manuals available, and the battery can be replaced for £245 by Apple. Repair specialists iFixit praised the machine’s more repairable design but criticised Apple’s use of software locks on replacement parts. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The 14in MacBook Pro starts at £2,149 ($1,999/A$3,199) for an M2 Pro chip with 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Models with the 12-core CPU/19-core GPU M2 Pro cost from £2,499, while M2 Max models start at £3,149. The 16in MacBook Pro starts at £2,699 ($2,499/A$3,999). It is not possible to upgrade the RAM or storage after purchase. For comparison, the MacBook Air M2 starts at £1,249, while Windows laptops roughly equivalent to the new machines, such as the Dell XPS 15, cost about £1,950, the Razer Blade 14 is about £2,100 and Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio costs from £1,449. Verdict The 14in MacBook Pro is a truly excellent laptop with serious power and longer battery life than any of its competitors. Many of its parts are best in class and put together in a very easy to live with package. But it comes at a very high cost, and one that may be prohibitive even to those looking for a pro-grade workhorse – £2,149 buys an awful lot of machine elsewhere. Certainly for Apple consumers, it makes the £1,249 M2 MacBook Air all the more enticing at £900 less than the entry-level Pro, though still not exactly cheap. For those who need a Mac but don’t need the power and ports, there aren’t that many corners cut for the Air. Still, it is encouraging to see Apple continue to make progress with its own chips in increasing performance and energy efficiency hand in hand. Longer battery life is always welcome. Pros: powerful, very long battery life, fantastic miniLED ProMotion screen, plenty of ports and SD card slot, brilliant speakers, Touch ID, great keyboard and trackpad, MagSafe, 14in is a great size. Cons: no USB-A, no Face ID, no Centre Stage camera, RAM or SSD can not be upgraded after purchase, no Boot Camp/Windows support, very expensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T14:20:58Z","webTitle":"Elizabeth Leonskaja review – passion, power and purpose","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/aug/28/elizabeth-leonskaja-review-passion-power-and-purpose","fields":{"bodyText":"Pianist Elisabeth Leonskaja will shortly be playing at the Beethoven festival in Bonn, the composer’s birthplace, so it was something of a coup for the Machynlleth festival to have secured her for the same programme, namely the last three of his 32 sonatas, the triptych that constitutes a pinnacle of the repertoire. Machynlleth can claim to have been the ancient capital of Wales and, such was the calibre of this particular evening, the town certainly felt like a cultural capital. Leonskaja’s opening gesture was an indication of her seriousness of purpose, lifting the redundant music desk away from the instrument, placing it on the floor, disdaining the flutter of amused applause and, without further ado, launching into the E major sonata Op 109, immediately capturing its idiosyncratic balance between light pastoral flow and slow declamatory passion. The minor mode Prestissimo was almost martial in its fierceness, the perfect foil for the warm serenity of the theme and variations finale, albeit laced with fugal feist. The Tabernacle – formerly a chapel, yet with a surprising intimacy – has a fine acoustic and, in the A flat major sonata Op 110, Leonskaja again instinctively used it to her advantage, and to Beethoven’s, with a palette of tone-colours from gently muted to vibrant, and a similarly commanding dynamic range. Clarity of delineation and ease in every phrase allowed the structure to unfold organically. In the final sonata in C minor, Op 111, there were moments which seemed to be the summation of all the earlier C minor masterpieces, forceful yet also achieving a transcendent majesty. Leonskaja’s ability to produce the most powerful sound and allow it to resonate fully suggested an artist fully conscious of the privilege of giving aural expression to what the stone-deaf Beethoven had heard only in his extraordinary imagination. With barely a minute’s pause between sonatas Leonskaja was like a climber intent on pursuing her summit – this was not a leisurely affair, nor was it absolutely immaculate. That mattered not a jot. Here was innate pianism, with musical sensibilities and a daring honed by a lifetime of experience. She was cheered to the rafters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/03/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Kyiv says the attempt to retake ground is already under way but Russia has dismissed its prospects of success. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, announced on Monday that an offensive in Kherson – the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began – had begun. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had begun attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. However two Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines in Kherson, who have oversight of events, described to Isobel Koshiw a situation that differed from the Ukrainian officials’ statements. According to them, fighting is taking place in Kherson region, but it is not the major counteroffensive being touted by Kyiv. Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success, Archie Bland explains. Kyiv also needs to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population ahead of a grim winter and at the same time maintaining the support of western leaders. UN team leads mission to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday amid calls from Zelenskiy and the international community to demilitarise and safeguard the site from potential radiation disaster. “We are going to a war zone,” IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said ahead of the visit he described as a “technical mission” to prevent a nuclear accident at Europe’s largest atomic plant, Isobel Koshiw reported from Kyiv. In the days leading up to the visit, Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors along the pre-agreed route to deny the IAEA inspectors safe passage to the plant. Just hours before the team was due to cross from Ukrainian into Russian-held territory, the nearby city of Enerhodar came under fire, Jon Henley reported. A defiant Grossi told reporters: “We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there.” The nuclear chief confirmed after returning to Ukrainian-held territory that a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he added. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Children return to Ukrainian school trashed by occupying Russian forces Children and teachers gathered on the grass outside School No 2 in Borodianka on Thursday morning for the first day of the academic year, Isobel Koshiw writes from the town once occupied by Russian forces just north of Kyiv. There were speeches and a recital of the Ukrainian national anthem, and as is traditional the girls wore white scrunchies in their hair, the boys white shirts. They brought flowers to give to their teachers. But there will be no lessons in the classrooms of School No 2 this year. The invading soldiers used the school as a base and then trashed it as they left. Where enough students opted for in-person teaching and the schools are fit for use, school administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. All children who attend in person are told to carry an emergency bag with a change of clothes, any medicine they may need, a note from their parents and, for the younger children, a favourite toy. Putin: trapped and desperate Russia’s president is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him, Simon Tisdall asks. Putin keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected and an endless military quagmire is not a scenario he can afford. Slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? As pressure on him grows to produce a breakthrough, Putin may well decide his best option is to raise the cost of the war to Ukraine’s backers in the context of rising anxiety over Europe’s energy and cost of living crises, largely caused by the invasion and Kremlin cuts to gas supplies. Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet leader who ended cold war, dies aged 91 Meanwhile in Russia, Andrew Roth and Luke Harding reported the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader whose reforms led to the unlooked for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, died in Moscow aged 91 after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. He will be associated with his attempts to modernise and to improve the Soviet Union, a process that he ultimately lost control of, leading to the country’s collapse. In his last years, Gorbachev was a paradoxical figure. Abroad, he was viewed as the hero of the cold war, whose actions – or lack of them – ushered in a freer world. In Russia he was largely reviled and unloved, an unperson at best, a traitor at worst, Pjotr Sauer explains. The Kremlin appeared unsure how to mark Gorbachev’s death this week, issuing a statement saying Putin would not attend the funeral or the public farewell ceremony, in what will be seen as an extraordinary snub by the Russian president. However Putin did visit the open coffin of the former Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers at the mourning hall of Moscow’s central clinical hospital.

Unveiling details of the proposed law, Shapps said ministers would consult during the progress of the bill on what minimum services levels would be required for fire, ambulance and transport services, including rail. The measures, which could lead to striking staff being sacked, will also affect health, education, border security and nuclear decommissioning. In these areas, Shapps said, the hope was to reach agreed minimum service levels “that mean that we don’t have to use that power in the bill”. Again, these were not set out. Explanatory notes for the bill, published after Shapps spoke, gave no details for what level of minimum services would be required. Under the law, the business secretary would be given the powers “to make regulations providing for levels of service where there are strikes in relevant services”. Employers must consult with unions on what this means in practice before a strike, the bill states. It also confirms that staff who breach minimum service levels will lose employment protections and could be sacked. Despite the government’s insistence that the planned law, which will apply to England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland, is not an attack on the right to strike, unions have labelled it as heavy-handed and likely to exacerbate industrial disputes rather than limit their impact. Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT rail union, called the bill “an attack on human rights and civil liberties which we will oppose in the courts, parliament and the workplace”. Sharon Graham, the leader of Unite, called it “another dangerous gimmick from a government that should be negotiating to resolve the current crisis they have caused”. Introducing the as yet unpublished bill in the Commons, Shapps singled out unions representing ambulance crews, who strike again on Wednesday, for not setting out national minimum service levels. “While we absolutely believe in the right to strike, we’re duty bound to protect the lives and the livelihoods of the British people,” Shapps said. The new ambulance strike “will result in patchy emergency care for the British people – and this cannot continue”, he said. Shapps added: “We do not want to use this legislation. But we must ensure the safety of the British public.” The Unison trade union has rejected Shapps’ characterisation of arrangements for the ambulance strike as meaning there would not be sufficient coverage as “a lie”. Ambulance staff will stagger their industrial action over the course of the day to cover gaps, with none walking out for more than 12 hours and many doing so for no more than six hours. Responding in the Commons for Labour, the party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, described the bill as a distraction from the wider problems of staff shortages and low pay that have prompted strikes in so many public areas. Rayner said that one of her constituents died recently while waiting for an ambulance: “That was not on a strike day. That is because of the disastrous chaos we have in the system under this Conservative government. His government offers no solution because they have caused the problem.” Shapps “knows the NHS cannot find the nurses that they need to work on the wards”, Rayner said. “He knows the trains don’t run even on non-strike days, such is the shortage of staff. So how can he seriously think that sacking thousands of key workers won’t just plunge our public services further into crisis?” The legislation showed, Rayner said, “a government that is out of ideas, out of time, and fast running out of sticking plasters; a government that is playing politics with nurses’ and teachers’ lives because they can’t stomach the cooperation and negotiation that’s needed. “We need negotiation, not legislation. So when is the minister going to do his job?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T10:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘When you hear the four-minute warning’ … Whatever happened to Britain’s nuclear bunkers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/24/when-you-hear-the-four-minute-warning-whatever-happened-to-britains-nuclear-bunkers","fields":{"bodyText":"Michael Parrish has a “wedding guest list” of people he will allow into his three-level, 125ft (38 metre)-deep concrete bunker in the event of a nuclear attack. Situated below an inconspicuous bungalow in Brentwood, Essex, the Kelvedon Hatch bunker was built on Parrish’s grandfather’s land in the 1950s and maintained as secret regional government headquarters throughout the cold war. After it was decommissioned in 1992, the Parrishes bought back the bunker – for more than 20 years, it has been a tourist attraction and a sleepover location for Boy Scouts. Today, it is also potentially a lifeline. “We have our own water, we have our own electricity, we have our own toilets, because one day I may need it,” says Parrish, 75, wearing a burgundy jumper with the words “secret nuclear bunker” embroidered in yellow on the left breast. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, 15 people have inquired about hiring a space in the bunker in the event of nuclear war, but Parrish wants to charge £500,000 a head (a bargain, he says, if you spend 10 to 20 years down there avoiding nuclear fallout). Who will he bring in for free? “What it amounts to is a wedding list: you have your family, you have your sister. Do you have your sister’s boyfriend? Probably. Do you have his parents? No,” Parrish says. He has light brown eyes, coiffed grey hair and a serious mouth that betrays no hint of a joke. The last 20 or so spaces in Parrish’s bunker, he says, will be reserved for “young, 25-year-olds – of either sex, before you think I’ve got this all wrong. Because you’ve got to think of the world.” Once upon a time, not all that long ago, operational nuclear bunkers were dotted up and down Britain, from sprawling complexes like Parrish’s to underground “monitoring posts”, which were less than five metres long and were used by the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) during the cold war. What has happened to all of these subterranean safe havens? In an age of renewed nuclear threat, what is the bunker status quo? How many have been maintained and how many have fallen into disrepair? More pressingly, what chance do you and I stand of getting in? With help-yourself audio guides and an honesty box ticketing system, it is easy to feel like the last woman alive in Parrish’s bunker. When I visit in early November, I initially don’t see another soul (unless you count the waxworks – a toothsome Maggie Thatcher sits behind real radio controls). It’s an eerie time capsule with a musty tang in the air. You might technically be able to survive for years down here, but would you want to? “My wife is quite adamant that she wouldn’t,” Parrish says. In Cheshire and in St Andrews, two other former secret nuclear bunkers have also become visitor attractions. In Wiltshire, billions of pounds of wine is stored by a private company in a former MoD bunker, while an old command centre in Essex has been converted into luxury flats. The Kingsway telephone exchange, a second world war air-raid shelter and cold war communications facility built under the tube in London, is still owned by BT, which tried to sell it in 2008. A spokesperson said the building is not operational and is not being used for anything, not even storage. More than 1,500 ROC monitoring posts were built across the country from the mid-1950s. Designed to house three people, these mini-shelters were places where volunteers could measure nuclear fallout and broadcast messages to the public after an attack. Many of these bunkers have fallen into disrepair, but some have been bought by members of the public – in March, a bunker on sale in Norfolk for £25,000 received 200 inquiries in three days. Russ McLean, owner of the listings website Unique Property Bulletin – which features numerous shelters for sale – says: “Sadly we have seen a significant uptick in the demand for nuclear bunkers,” since Russia invaded Ukraine. But Luke Bennett, associate professor of natural and built environments at Sheffield Hallam University, describes these bunkers as “tiny underground sheds” and says they are difficult to renovate into appealing spaces. “You wouldn’t really want to sleep in a cold, dank, windowless, underground shed.” He says these buildings are mostly bought by “bunker hunter” hobbyists (one in Perthshire was briefly converted into a holiday home, but guests had to do without electricity or running water). “There aren’t really any facilities in the UK that are ripe for reactivating,” says Bennett, whose former work as a lawyer saw him selling off old government bunkers. Beyond the ROC’s “underground sheds”, Bennett estimates that there were no more than 50 regional government bunkers in the UK. In 2021, he traced the afterlife of four that had been built in the late 80s and found that only one – in Ballymena in Northern Ireland – would be somewhat usable in event of a modern attack. “The nuclear bunkers constructed in the cold-war era have fallen pretty much into ruin,” he says. “Even the most recently built ones are pretty much beyond use now because they’ve had their life support equipment stripped out or they haven’t been maintained over the years.” Bennett believes most people would be surprised to learn how few shelters the government built during the cold war. While countries across the globe constructed shelters after the detonation of the first nuclear weapon in 1945, some invested in infrastructure more than others. A programme of “bunkerisation” in Albania between the 1960s and 80s led to the construction of more than 750,000 military bunkers. In 1976, Switzerland completed the largest civilian fallout shelter in the world, the Sonnenberg tunnel, which could house 20,000 people. Since 1963, Switzerland has been constitutionally obliged to provide shelter space for every citizen, meaning that, by law, apartment blocks must be fitted with shelters. Today, the country has more bunker spaces than it does residents: its population of 8.6 million can access 365,000 shelters that have room for nearly 9 million people. In the US, iconic black and yellow shelter signs sprung up around the country after the second world war, signposting where citizens could shelter during a nuclear attack. In 1955, the Federal Civil Defense Administration instructed people to construct fallout shelters in their own homes and gardens, and there were more than 200,000 private shelters in the country by 1965. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin allegedly has a hi-tech bunker in Siberia complete with an energy substation that could power a small city. It is rumoured that wealthy Russians are buying and building nuclear bunkers, while in October, what appeared to be a leaked document showed an order for a bomb shelter-turned-car park to be cleared out and brought up to scratch. The country purportedly has just under 17,000 bomb shelters. By contrast, “the UK never really had a big, sincere commitment to spending a lot of money on building voluminous underground facilities that large numbers of people could sit out a nuclear war in,” Bennett says. The ROC’s 1,500 shelters were built from 1956 onwards, but they were only designed to house Royal Observer Corps volunteers, not regular civilians. Although new shelters are undoubtedly being constructed, this is on a need-to-know basis, so it is difficult to gauge the extent of recent bunker building. Of course, the country’s VIPs would always have a place to stay. While it is unclear who exactly will go where to survive nuclear Armageddon, the civil defence historian Nathan Hazlehurst says: “Key members of central government, the military and royal family will have access to bunkers, along with those staff needed to run the country post-attack.” Hazlehurst, who works as an emergency preparedness manager in the NHS, says the MoD has maintained “a number” of bunkers across the country, although naturally information about them is top secret. Some snippets of information have leaked out. An underground bunker at RAF Boulmer, in Northumberland, was renovated in 2002. A journalist gained access to an RAF bunker in Buckinghamshire in 2015 and described it as “a functional and complex building”. The government’s permanent joint headquarters in Northwood, north-west London, has its own bunker that is permanently staffed by security. Below Whitehall is the £126.3m defence crisis management centre known as Pindar, which is believed to be connected to Downing Street via tunnels. David Moore is a London-based photographer who was permitted access to an underground government crisis command centre in the early 00s. Many have speculated that his resulting photograph collection, 2008’s The Last Things, depicts Pindar, though he is not at liberty to say. “It’s quite a surreal environment in some ways and ordinary in others,” Moore says. Among other things, his photographs depict a concrete entrance way with a small, green “To bomb shelter area” sign pointing down some stairs; an emergency briefing room that – bar a lectern – could be any other office; a document shredder; a green-screened broadcast studio; giant red metal doors; and some art and ornaments that were seemingly placed to make the whole thing feel more homely. “It’s a very functional space which is difficult to navigate and was at the time sparsely populated,” Moore says. He says “everything was sort of humming” on standby. At various points on his visit, Moore says, the air quality was “not so great” (incidentally, most of the complex had no smell, though some areas near generators smelled “industrial”). “The thing about the space is even when you’re in it, you don’t know specifically what it’s for,” Moore says. Others who have gained access to special and secret spaces are members of exploration society Subterranea Britannica. In the 1950s the government built an alternative seat of power in Corsham, Wiltshire, but the so-called Burlington bunker, or central government war headquarters, was decommissioned in 2004. In 2013, Martin Dixon, a 40-year member of Subterranea Britannica, was allowed to visit. (The MoD still manages much of the underground space, but for security and health and safety reasons, the public are no longer allowed access.) “It wasn’t in tremendous condition, it really wasn’t maintained,” says Dixon, 67, who has visited more than 1,000 human-made underground spaces. At Corsham, he was able to see ventilation systems, standby generators and a telephone exchange. “I think because the cold war never happened it isn’t as chilling as visiting sites that were active during the second world war,” Dixon says. “A parachute that hasn’t been used is a parachute, whereas one that saved someone’s life somehow acquires a greater poignancy.” It remains to be seen whether Corsham will earn that poignancy in the coming years. In March, a senior adviser to the Cabinet Office told the i newspaper that the UK is “totally unprepared” to advise the public about nuclear attacks; the government website currently says that a new “emergency alerts” system is expected to launch in autumn 2022. Hazlehurst says that if threats become more tangible, then there needs to be greater education of the public, although he does not believe the government should build any more bunkers. “Though having infrastructure is important, it should only form a small part of the whole. Having trained personnel and coherent, workable plans across the country is more important,” he says. He adds that the pandemic has prompted some form of preparation: local authorities took on roles – “such as food distribution, body storage, and liaison with health and uniformed services” – that would be similar in the event of nuclear war. “Covid and other incidents have shown the real value of letting local authorities coordinate the response locally with central assistance,” Hazlehurst says. Does that mean nuclear survival is yet another postcode lottery? Hazlehurst says some councils have teams of emergency planners while others leave emergency planning to staff with additional roles. If you don’t live near a former bunker – and don’t have £500,000 spare to bunk with Parrish – then your best bet after a nuclear explosion is to stay inside and if possible get down to a basement, he says. Perhaps – somewhat damningly – the smartest thing you can do to prepare for a nuclear war right now is make friends with someone like Parrish – good friends, that is, the kind he would invite to his wedding. Still, you might have time on your side. “One of the first school groups we had, 20-odd years ago, one of the little kids described it as an upside down Norman castle,” Parrish says of his Kelvedon Hatch bunker. “And I thought that was absolutely right: it’s not going to fall down. It’s 10ft-thick reinforced walls, there’s no rot. It’s going to be here in a thousand years’ time.” If Parrish does manage to survive a nuclear attack, he jokes – although, actually, it’s hard to tell if he is joking – he may emerge from his bunker as king of Essex."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/19/nsw-labor-promises-to-create-great-koala-national-park-if-it-wins-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-18T14:00:47Z","webTitle":"NSW Labor promises to create ‘great koala national park’ if it wins power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/nsw-labor-promises-to-create-great-koala-national-park-if-it-wins-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/19/nsw-labor-promises-to-create-great-koala-national-park-if-it-wins-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The New South Wales Labor party will establish a new national park stretching from Kempsey to Coffs Harbour in a bid to save the state’s endangered koala population. On Thursday the opposition leader, Chris Minns, will announce that the party will re-commit to establishing the “great koala national park” on the NSW north coast, which could see an area of about 300,000 hectares of key habitat for the native species protected from logging. The park, which Labor has promised in the past two state elections, is likely to anger the timber and logging industry, which has previously claimed it would cost the state thousands of jobs. Other estimates claim the park would add about $1bn to the state’s economy over 15 years. Labor has sought to head off criticism by promising an initial $80m to first carry out consultation and an independent economic assessment of the park’s “impact on local jobs and communities”. Environment groups have long called for the park, which would be created by linking about 140,000 hectares of existing national parks with about 170,000 hectares of state forest. The land is estimated to be home to about 20% of the state’s wild koala population. Labor said it won’t commit to the size of the park immediately – nor the potential cost of compensation for the logging industry as a result of the transfer of state forest land – but will use “expert scientific advice” to guide its establishment. In February last year Australia’s koala population was officially listed as endangered, a step environmental groups said came after a decade-long failure to address habitat destruction since the animal was first listed as threatened in 2012. In 2020, a NSW parliamentary inquiry found the species would be extinct in the state by 2050 unless governments took urgent action to protect its habitat. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Minns said he wanted to turn the animal’s “grim trajectory around”. “I don’t accept that one of our most loved and iconic native species could become extinct here in just 28 years’ time,” he said. “By protecting the places these koalas live, and by working closely with all stakeholders, we can ensure we bring these incredible creatures back from the brink.” Labor will hope the announcement also shifts attention to the government’s record on the animal. The Coalition faced an existential threat in 2020 when former deputy premier John Barilaro threatened to move the Nationals to the crossbench over a land clearing bill. That conflict threatened to rear itself again in November last year, when the Nationals proposed new legislation that would strip councils of their powers to regulate native forestry operations on private land. The bill was quickly dropped after a revolt from moderate Liberal party MPs. The animosity resulting from the battle over land clearing within the Coalition led former MP Catherine Cusack to publish text messages from former premier Gladys Berejiklian which she said showed a “deal” had been done with the Nationals to allow for weaker land clearing laws. “After 12 years, six environment ministers, the weakening of environmental protections and koala wars between the Liberals and Nationals, koalas are now listed as endangered,” Labor’s environment spokesperson Penny Sharpe said. On Thursday Labor will also announce that it will transfer ownership of a series of wildlife corridors in Woronora Heights in Sydney’s south from Sydney Water to the National Parks and Wildlife Services. The water authority caused local outrage in 2021 when it presented plans to subdivide the land for development despite evidence it contained koala habitat. Those plans were shelved late last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/22/tsunami-warning-after-70-magnitude-earthquake-near-solomon-islands","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-22T02:57:27Z","webTitle":"Buildings damaged and power lost after earthquakes hit Solomon Islands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/22/tsunami-warning-after-70-magnitude-earthquake-near-solomon-islands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/22/tsunami-warning-after-70-magnitude-earthquake-near-solomon-islands","fields":{"bodyText":"Buildings were left damaged and widespread power outages reported in the Solomons Island capital, Honiara, after two earthquakes struck just off the south-west coast on Tuesday. The first magnitude 7.0 earthquake briefly triggered a tsunami warning from the United States Geological Survey, but this warning was withdrawn soon after. A second quake, with a magnitude of 6.0, struck nearby 30 minutes later. Power was out in some areas of Honiara and Solomon Islands Broadcasting said in a statement that all radio services were off air. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the roof of the Australian high commission annexe in Honiara had collapsed, “which points to likely damage throughout the city”. “We have contacted prime minister Sogavare to once again indicate Australia stands ready to assist.” Albanese said all staff of the Australian high commission were safe, but confirming the safety of all Australians in Solomon Islands was difficult because telecommunications had been disrupted. The quake near Malango was shallow, with a depth of 10km, the USGS said. People reported violent shaking that threw televisions and other items to the ground. Freelance journalist Charley Piringi said he was standing outside a warehouse next to a primary and a secondary school on the outskirts of the capital, Honiara, when the quake struck, sending the children running. “The earthquake rocked the place,” he said. “It was a huge one. We were all shocked, and everyone is running everywhere.” The nation’s attorney general, John Muria, posted images on social media of office files spilled from large metal filing cabinets. “This was a big one,” Joy Nisha, a receptionist at the Heritage Park Hotel in Honiara, told the AFP news agency. “Some of the things in the hotel fell.

There’s a touch of British folk horror and an evident Lynchian influence on the unnerving, uncanny world that the man discovers. Inland creates atmosphere rather than providing answers – an atmosphere enfolded in mossy, ominous shades of damp green and grey.

As per the title, director Álvaro F Pulpeiro has a habit of looking frequently to the skies, casting them in an aghast, high-contrast yellow and indigo, as if the spillage of this petrostate’s woes has tainted something spiritual in the higher order of things. Interspersing it all with radio commentary discoursing on million per-cent inflation and the disputed 2018 election, and poetry extracts tolling the bell for the country itself, Pulpeiro roams Venezuela in search of telling vignettes: soldiers firing ordnance off navy vessels in the Caribbean, refugees joining the exodus into Brazil, a recurring ride-along with a man transporting a newborn child (a symbol of hope, or maybe hopelessness). Only once – as a mariachi group serenades a pair of giggling women in the back of a pickup truck – is there much optimism. Otherwise, the pervasive mood is a sense of betrayal by those in power. At one point, driving around as the baby wails in the backseat, the radio relays Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro denouncing Donald Trump, and Pulpeiro owns them both with another burst of verse: “I’m talking to you as a child from a homeland just like any other / A father like any other / Voracious Saturn.” That Venezuela is devouring its children hits home in the long final section, accompanying a group of almost Mad Max-like wastrels decanting gasoline in rough conditions at a makeshift depot in the Guajira desert just across the border in Colombia.

Toy sales slumped by more than £100m last year, according to figures released to coincide with this week’s British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA) fair in London, meaning the buyers there were desperate to identify the next big toy or trend for kids and, increasingly, the kidults who buy £1bn worth of toys for themselves. Melissa Symonds, an analyst at the market researcher NPD, says toy sales were hit by the cost of living crisis. Total sales fell back 3% to £3.6bn while the number of products sold dropped 6% as parents shunned cheaper impulse buys. There was also no escape from inflation, with the average selling price up 3% to £10.54. “We’re not expecting huge growth this year because the economy is still uncertain,” Symonds says. “People are still going to be price-conscious … but will still want to distract themselves or their kids. That is something toys has over other categories – there is always an element of joy.” Kidults rule In 2022 the sweet spot was the kidult (buyers aged 12 and over) market, which is still growing and now equates to almost 30% of UK toy sales. After rediscovering childhood passions during lockdown, adults are opting to spend on Lego and collectible toys rather than nights out. The maker of plastic bricks continues to target this group with new sets and themes such as the Botanical Collection, which, with sets such as a £45 dried flower centrepiece, analysts say is aimed at women. Playmobil is also tapping into nostalgia for childhood favourites, with sets devoted to Asterix and the 80s TV favourite Magnum, PI. The latter, due out in April, includes a Ferrari 308 GTS Quattrovalvole and a figure complete with Hawaiian shirt and Tom Selleck’s trademark moustache. Disney is 100 Despite the grim picture for toy town as a whole, in 2022 sales of licensed toys were actually up 5.5% thanks to spin-offs from classics such as Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. These kinds of toys make up almost a third of sales, and analysts are predicting another “good year” because of the welter of merchandise – from dolls, cuddly toys and Lego to even a Rubik’s Cube – celebrating characters and films from the Disney archive as it turns 100. This year’s Barbie film is also set to provide a shot in the arm for Mattel’s veteran doll brand, which is enjoying a renaissance. Old favourites return Sesame Street, Paddington Bear and Wallace and Gromit … there were lots of familiar names on the list of 25 “hero” toys of the year produced by the BTHA for the event. A £35 cuddly singing Elmo to help preschoolers crack potty training garnered a lot of attention, while for 80s kids the £20 Care Bear provides a blast from the past. Honey, I shrunk the toys The micro toy trend manages to sate collectors and small budgets at the same time. Analysts point to the Bitty Pop! toy range, which debuted at the London show. It offers tiny versions of the popular Funko Pop! figures, and the first wave features characters from Harry Potter and, of course, Disney. The Bitty Pop! figures will go sale in the summer in a four-pack costing £13. Plush (soft) toys are huge While other toys were left on the shelf in 2022, sales of plush toys jumped 29%. They are expected to be popular this year too because of Squishmallows, the cuddly toy brand that is huge on TikTok. Are you a ‘faithful’? Britons rediscovered board games during the coronavirus pandemic and have kept on playing, with murder mystery and escape room games growing in popularity. With millions hooked on the BBC’s recent hit show The Traitors, the board game is expected to be one of the biggest toys of the year, with predictions we will all be hosting Traitors nights come Christmas. The game, costing £30, is due out in the autumn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-18T04:30:42Z","webTitle":"What are European countries doing to cut power consumption?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/18/what-are-european-countries-doing-to-cut-power-consumption","fields":{"bodyText":"Paris is switching off the Eiffel Tower lights an hour early, Milan has turned off public fountains, and Hanover is offering gym users cold rather than hot showers in an effort to combat potential energy shortages this winter. At the same time, the public are being encouraged to do their bit by avoiding using household appliances between 4pm and 7pm, stock up on blankets and slow down their driving. One global retail chain is encouraging staff to change their behaviours: to use stairs instead of lifts, to use energy-saving apps at home, and unplug devices rather than leaving them on standby. The UK, by contrast, has blocked a £15m campaign encouraging the public to conserve energy, with the government arguing that the country is “not a nanny state”. But across Europe, governments and municipal authorities have responded to calls to reduce power consumption and reach an EU target of shaving 15% off energy consumption by next March. All member states are reducing heating in public buildings by one degree to 19C, but some have gone further. France The Eiffel Tower lights are being turned off more than an hour early, shaving 4% off energy costs as the city responds to the government call to reduce fuel usage. The government has also launched a major communication campaign, “Every gesture counts”, encouraging individuals and industry to do their bit. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which owns more than 500 stores including brands such as Christian Dior, Givenchy and Tiffany, and supermarket chains LeClerc and Carrefour are turning the lights off in their shops three hours early. Workers are also being encouraged into “new energy consumption behaviours” such as using stairs instead of lifts, not using printers, and unplugging computers and electric cars. At home, people are being asked to keep the heating at 19C or lower in living rooms and kitchens (17C in bedrooms), drop boiler temperatures to 55C, use energy-intensive appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines during off-peak hours, and turn standby mode on devices including TVs and wifi routers off when not being used. Households that do so will be rewarded with a “sobriety bonus” (details to be announced), as will commuters who join a car pool. Public building managers have been told to switch to LED bulbs, turn off hot water boilers unless they are essential, and not heat offices above 19C. Sports complexes must lower their heating by two degrees and public swimming pools their water temperature by one degree, while street lights and signage will be dialled down in intensity, switched on for shorter periods, and where possible switched off altogether between 1am and 6am. Companies and public sector employers have been instructed to organise home working so that their premises can be closed altogether for three or four days at a time, and people with cars provided by public sector employers must limit their speed. Owners of private buildings are encouraged to reduce thermostats to 19C while occupied and lower them further to 16C overnight and 8C if they are not occupied for more than two days, as on bank holiday weekends. Ukraine Ukraine is not just fighting a war against Russia, but an energy crisis in one of the coldest countries in Europe. While the EU drops its thermostats to 19C, Ukraine’s authorities are talking about reducing central heating in building to four degrees lower than normal, between 17C and 18C. People have been advised to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and below the -10C winter average. Spain Under a government decree, temperatures can be set no higher than 19C in public buildings. The new rules do not apply to households, but people are being encouraged to follow suit. Shops must also switch off window display lighting from 10pm and any air-conditioned or heated premises must have an automatic door-closing mechanism installed to avoid energy waste. Spain, which is not as dependent on Russian energy supplies as many other EU countries, has agreed to a 7%-8% reduction in gas use in solidarity with other EU countries. The measures will remain in place until November next year. Belgium Staff have been told not to grumble after the thermostat at the EU council of ministers HQ and Europa building, the site of EU summits, was reduced to 19C. “Compensating for the lower thermostat setting by bringing in individual electrical heaters is obviously out of the question,” says an internal memo that advises staff to “consider coming to work with an extra sweater” and not hesitate to wear it because “energy matters more than our traditional dress code”. The Europa lantern – the internal oval-shaped structure in the Council HQ known as the space egg – will be turned off, while the vast atrium will be switched to a chilly 14C. MEPs have also reopened their longstanding campaign against the European parliament’s monthly commute to Strasbourg. The German Christian Democrat MEP Peter Liese has called on parliamentary authorities to abandon the Strasbourg trip until April, because “if we ask everyone to save energy, it is not responsible to heat two buildings and make unnecessary trips”. Ireland A “reduce your use” government campaign is urging the public to use cookers, tumbledryers, washing machines and kettles efficiently and, where possible, outside peak hours of 4pm to 7pm. The government of the car-dependent country is also asking motorists to drive more slowly, maintain tyre pressure, and drive smoothly to conserve energy consumption. It is also encouraging them to switch one journey a week to walking, cycling or public transport. Ireland delayed switching on heating at the Dáil. In September several members of parliament complained about the cold, but the staff who run the complex said they wished to set an example. In an email, managers said the heating would not be turned on until 3 October at the earliest. After four days of setting an example, the heating was switched on. Germany Public monuments, including the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, public buildings and advertising billboards can only be illuminated between 4pm and 10 pm, except during cultural festivals. An annual light show festival in Berlin went ahead this week, but the organisers said they had managed to reduce the consumption of electricity by 75% compared with last year. Heating in corridors in public buildings will be switched off. The maximum temperature in public administration offices is 19C. There is no binding maximum temperature for homes, but privately owned swimming pools must no longer be heated with electricity or gas unless “urgently necessary for therapeutic use or to avoid damages to the pool technology”. Temperatures at public pools have also been lowered. Some municipalities have gone further and turned off instant hot water. Hanover said hot water would not be available for handwashing or showers in public buildings, swimming pool showers, sport halls and gyms. Italy Operation Thermostat this spring already led to a number of energy-saving measures, including the switching-off of public fountains. The Italian government is asking homeowners to turn central heating down by 1C and to turn it off for an extra hour every day. It is also encouraging people to take shorter showers, to use dishwashers and washing machines only when fully loaded, and not to leave home appliances on standby. Netherlands The Dutch government is advising households and business on measures to cut consumption, including turning down heating by 1C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T16:06:11Z","webTitle":"Britons save £3m by using power-hungry appliances at quieter times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","fields":{"bodyText":"Britons have saved almost £3m by using tumble dryers and other power-hungry devices at quieter times, under a scheme that aims to reduce the strain on electricity networks, National Grid has said. The electricity system operator (ESO) launched an initiative last month to incentivise consumers and businesses to reduce their energy use, by running appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers and tumble dryers before or after particular designated periods when demand was expected to be heavy. National Grid said on Wednesday the “demand flexibility service” had delivered more than 780 megawatt (MW) hours of demand reduction, and £2.8m in savings over five test periods since the scheme launched last month. More than 1m households and firms had signed up to participate, it said. Customers are normally given 24 hours notice to shift their power usage from a peak period – typically 4pm to 7pm. Savings are passed on via energy suppliers to customers who have signed up. Craig Dyke, the head of national control at the ESO, said: “Delivering the first of the demand flexibility service test events is a major milestone in the evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK. This service successfully proves that consumers up and down the country are standing by to get involved in flexibility solutions.” Separately, gas and power prices fell on Wednesday in signs that the strain on the UK and Europe’s energy supplies was easing despite the icy weather. A marked increase in nuclear output from power stations in France and hydroelectric power in southern Europe has lifted pressure on electricity supplies across northern Europe. The UK price for gas for delivery on Thursday fell 4% at 332p a therm, while month-ahead prices were down 5.6% at 322p a therm. The price of power, which reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange this week, fell to £353 in a volatile market. Power prices for delivery on Thursday fell nearly 7% in Germany and about 5% in France. Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills. The cold weather combined with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero. Emergency power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby on Monday but ultimately not used. Live data from ESOon Wednesday showed wind accounting for 27% of electricity generation, behind gas with 47% and ahead of nuclear at 13%. Separately, French nuclear output has ramped up in recent days and is expected to improve through the week as four more nuclear reactors, which were out of action for maintenance, are due to return. There have been concerns over power shortages this winter in the UK and Europe amid the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the improving weather and resilience of the system so far has brought some encouragement. Analysts at RBC investment bank said: “Despite this grim scenario for the week, we could see that the electricity system is coping relatively well with the situation, albeit power prices suffered a significant increase. “Despite the increase in gas demand on cold weather and low wind resource, we could see how gas storage levels are doing better even this week on any single day v the same day last year.” The rise in prices will have increased the cost of the government’s energy price guarantee scheme, which aims to cushion the blow of rising wholesale costs. The energy regulator is pushing for a cap on how much power stations can charge National Grid for backup electricity. Ofgem wants to tighten rules to prevent “excessive” profits and intends to publish proposals early next year, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Grid spent more than £27m paying power stations to crank up supplies at short notice on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T09:59:52Z","webTitle":"2,800 still without power in Shetland as cold blast bites UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/thousands-still-without-power-in-shetland-as-cold-blast-bites-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands have been without power in Shetland for a second night as Britain’s infrastructure continues to struggle with sub-zero temperatures. The Met Office has extended a yellow warning for snow and ice to Friday in northern Scotland and north-east England. The Scottish government declared a major incident on Tuesday after heavy snow left thousands of homes in Shetland without power on Monday evening. About 2,800 still have no electricity, and engineers described the “concentrated and explosive weather event” as the worst they had seen since Christmas 1995. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) was working to restore supply but it was not expected to be fully restored until the end of the week. More engineers were due to arrive in Shetland on the ferry from Aberdeen on Wednesday to help restore power. An SSEN spokesperson, Graeme Keddie, said: “Firstly, I’d like to apologise to those customers still without power and reassure them that we are making every effort to get to them.” He told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland that the company had reconnected 1,000 homes on Tuesday and continued to make progress. “We’ve got 15 additional line crews coming over on this morning’s freight ferry and more by helicopter, so that will make a real difference to restoration efforts,” he said. “This has been a very concentrated and explosive weather event on Shetland which was far more severe than forecast. The local teams have said this is the worst they’ve seen since 1995 over the Christmas period.” Snow and ice have been causing disruption on the roads since the start of the week. The RAC breakdown service recorded its busiest day on record on Monday, going to the assistance of about 12,000 drivers. Braemar in Aberdeenshire was the coldest place in the UK for the second night in a row on Tuesday, recording a temperature of -17.3C. The Met Office said on Twitter: “It will be another cold start this Wednesday morning with warnings for snow, ice and strong winds active across the UK.” The Met Office spokesperson Becky White said: “There will be a risk of ice across the country over the next few days, but particularly tonight.” Commenting on the latest yellow warning in northern Scotland and north-east England, White said some areas could see up to 10cm of fresh snow on higher ground, with 1-4cm at lower levels. In Sheffield, engineers reported that they still had just over 100 households left to reconnect to gas on Tuesday evening. Nearly 2,000 homes in the city lost supplies 11 days earlier when a burst water main filled the local gas network with more than a million litres of water. Snow and ice warnings were in place in the south-west of England until 10am on Wednesday. The region could see as much as 10cm of snow on higher ground such as Dartmoor and Exmoor. Ice warnings were also in place in for eastern England and northern parts of Northern Ireland, including Belfast, until midday on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/live/2023/jul/03/weather-excessive-heat-wave-temperature-warning-floods-follow-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-03T23:04:15Z","webTitle":"Millions swelter under extreme heat as climate crisis tightens grip on US – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/jul/03/weather-excessive-heat-wave-temperature-warning-floods-follow-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/live/2023/jul/03/weather-excessive-heat-wave-temperature-warning-floods-follow-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Here’s a recap of today’s developments: Millions across the US have been caught up in dangerous weather conditions over the weekend and are braced for further extreme conditions ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, as thunderstorms and intense heat continue to affect much of the country. As of Monday, 36 million people are under excessive heat warnings in the US, particularly in the south and western regions. Record high temperatures in some places will likely remain as many gear up to celebrate the Independence Day holiday on Tuesday. A large swath of the US, from northern California through Washington state, will bake under intense heat for multiple days this week. Many midwest cities are also dealing with the aftermath of severe rain and flooding. Weekend thunderstorms in Chicago flooded streets and highways, as nearly nine inches of rain fell in some areas of the city in just a few hours. Many in the midwest are still without power after the weekend storms. A 33-year-old woman died in her parked car in St Louis when a tree fell on the vehicle, and a five-year-old boy was killed in his bedroom when a tree fell on his house in Jennings, Missouri, in St Louis county. More wildfire smoke is expected to return to the northern states of the US, less than a week after smoke from Canadian wildfires resulted in hazy skies and dangerous air quality across the US midwest and north-east. A woman has died due to heat-related issues while on a hike at Grand Canyon national park, according to authorities. The hiker, identified as a 57-year-old woman, was attempting an eight-mile hike when she fell unconscious, a park release said. Park officials said the high temperature at Tuweep was well over 100F (37C) degrees on Sunday. The target of keeping long-term global warming within 1.5C (2.7F) is moving out of reach, climate experts have warned, with countries failing to set more ambitious goals despite months of record-breaking heat on land and sea. The target of keeping long-term global warming within 1.5C (2.7F) is moving out of reach, climate experts have warned, with countries failing to set more ambitious goals despite months of record-breaking heat on land and sea, Reuters reported. As climate envoys from the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters prepare to meet next month, the Chinese capital of Beijing saw record-breaking temperatures for the month, while parts of the US have been gripped by a prolonged heatwave for weeks. The World Meteorological Organization has predicted a 66% likelihood that global temperatures will breach 1.5C for at least one whole year between now and 2027. “Very unusual”, “worrying”, “terrifying” and “bonkers”: the reactions of veteran scientists to the sharp increase in north Atlantic surface temperatures over the past three months raise the question of whether the world’s climate has entered a more erratic and dangerous phase with the onset of an El Niño event on top of human-made global heating. Since April, the warming appears to have entered a new trajectory. Meanwhile, the area of global sea ice has dropped by more than 1m sq km (390,000 sq miles) below the previous low. “If a few decades ago, some people might have thought climate change was a relatively slow-moving phenomenon, we are now witnessing our climate changing at a terrifying rate,” said Prof Peter Stott, who leads the UK Met Office’s climate monitoring and attribution team. As the El Niño builds through the rest of this year, adding an extra oomph to the damaging effects of human-induced global heating, many millions of people across the planet and many diverse ecosystems are going to face extraordinary challenges and unfortunately suffer great damage. The El Niño climate pattern emerges when normal easterly winds weaken and warm water spreads across the whole Pacific. The immediate impact is on marine life which is unaccustomed to waters that have warmed by several degrees in some areas. More worrying still, the extra energy in the ocean, which is the world’s biggest heat absorber, may bring fiercer-than-usual storms, more destructive rain dumps and longer, hotter heatwaves. Read the full story here. High temperatures will soar to levels well above the historical average during the Fourth of July and beyond, forecasters say. Intense summer heat will increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, as people host outdoor parties, head out to cool off at the pool or lake, watch fireworks displays or even participate in holiday races. AccuWeather meteorologist Nicole LoBiondo said: The heat is due to a northward bulge of the jet stream that will allow a heat dome to develop over the northwestern US and western British Columbia, Canada. A large swath of the US, from Northern California through Washington state, will bake under intense heat for multiple days this week. LoBiondo continued: High temperatures through at least Wednesday are setting up to run 10–20 degrees Fahrenheit above the historical average for this time of year. Record high temperatures will be challenged from Medford, Oregon, to the southwestern Canadian coast. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect for portions of north-eastern Wyoming, south-eastern Montana, and western South Dakota, the National Weather Service said. A woman has died due to heat-related issues while on a hike at Grand Canyon national park, according to authorities. A park ranger was notified at about 6.30pm on Sunday that a hiker was in need of help in the remote Tuweep area of the park, park officials said. The hiker, identified as a 57-year-old woman, was attempting an 8-mile hike when she became unconscious, a park release said. A park ranger arrived at her location at about 1am on Monday and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Park officials said the high temperature at Tuweep was well over 100F (37C) degrees on Sunday. The National Park Service and the Mohave county medical examiner are investigating the incident. In Canada, crews are working to survey the damage after a tornado touched down north of Calgary on Saturday, destroying a number of homes and damaging others. A handful of homes were completely flattened by the twister that tore a path of destruction between the towns of Carstairs and Didsbury, CBC reported. No one was seriously injured by the storm, but a woman was found trapped in her basement after the tornado destroyed her house. Farm buildings and power infrastructure were also damaged or destroyed. Elisa Humphreys got in her car with her dog and cat and fled moments before the tornado destroyed her home on Saturday afternoon. When she returned, there was nothing but debris left. Humphreys told CBC News: There’s nothing here, there’s nothing here, it’s all gone. It almost looks like airplanes crashed here, but what it is, is the total destruction of two homes that have just been shredded and spread everywhere. Less than a week after smoke from Canadian wildfires resulted in hazy skies and dangerous air quality across the US midwest and north-east, more wildfire smoke is expected to return to cover a broader scope across the northern states. As of Monday, more than 500 active fires were burning across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). Of the fires active on Monday, at least 284 were considered to be “out of control”. By Monday morning, the total acreage burned this year was over 20.7m. Smoke is forecast to shift out of the Canadian Rockies and prairies into the neighboring northern plains and north-west US, leading to poor air quality and low visibility, AccuWeather reported. The smoke is forecast to reach cities like Seattle; Helena, Montana; and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Later in the week, there is some smoke risk and the potential for poor air quality to return as a surface high slides into the upper midwest, bringing a northern wind into the region and in the north-east, according to the AccuWeather meteorologist Joseph Bauer. He said: The general pattern through at least the middle portion of the month is supportive of having more episodes of smoke enter the Midwest and Northeast from Canada. As a result, more occurrences of poor air quality and hazy skies can occur in these areas more frequently. A weekend wildfire in southwestern Washington has grown to 533 acres and destroyed an undetermined number of structures, according to officials. Skamania county firefighters responded to reports of the wildfire on Sunday at about 11am, AP reports. Hot, windy conditions caused the fire to spread rapidly through the afternoon, prompting authorities to order residents in the area to evacuate. As of Monday morning, a total of 166 fire personnel were engaged with the fire, which is 0% contained. The fire threatens hundreds of residences, a fish hatchery and vineyards, the Seattle Times reported. The fire’s cause is under investigation. Intense storm conditions this weekend caused flooding in the Chicago area, shutting down interstates and trapping drivers attempting to navigate flooded areas. Here is more on how a heat dome hovering over parts of the south are increasing temperatures in New Orleans, from Sarah Sneath for the Guardian: After service ended at the New Philippians Missionary Baptist church in the lower ninth ward of New Orleans on Sunday, the church kept its doors open for people from the neighborhood who needed a break from the heat. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. On Sunday, heat index values threatened to hit 110F in New Orleans, according to the National Weather Service. The sermon in church that morning was about letting go. “Psalm 37 starts out with ‘Fret not thyself because of evildoers,’” said Pastor Anthony Jeanmarie III. “It’s just encouraging us as believers that things in life happen to us sometimes that are of ill intent, but our job is not to focus on the person or the problem.” But Mother Nature herself did not want to let go or let up, with a heat advisory expected to last through Tuesday. Heat index readings reached as high as 120F last week and evening temperatures in the 80s offered little reprieve. “This heat is disrespectful,” said church secretary Thelma Curtis. The city of New Orleans announced that cooling centers, including the New Philippians Missionary Baptist church, will be open for residents to escape the heat throughout the weekend. Louisiana’s high humidity makes it even harder for the body to cool down during high temperatures, said Alicia Van Doren, who helped write a recent report for the Louisiana department of health about heat-related illnesses in the state.

A 33-year-old woman died in her parked car in St Louis when a tree fell on the vehicle, AP News reported. A five-year-old boy was killed in his bedroom when a tree fell on his house in Jennings, Missouri, in St Louis County. The heating of the earth’s atmosphere and oceans by the burning of fossil fuels made the current extreme heatwave across the us at least five times more likely, according to a recent analysis by Climate Central, a climate science non-profit. The rolling heatwave marks the latest in a series of recent extreme “heat dome” events that have scorched various parts of the world. This heat dome was formed by a high-pressure atmospheric system that created a sinking column of warming air that trapped latent heat already absorbed by the landscape, like a sort of lid. Such events typically occur without rain and are cloudless, allowing the sun to bake the surface unhindered, causing temperatures to spike. “The heat evaporates water and then just heats up the land,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. If you have this sort of high-pressure system sitting stationary over a region, you can have these really impressive heatwaves. Heat domes have long existed in Texas, and elsewhere, and there is some conjecture among scientists as to whether or not the climate crisis is causing more “blocking events” where patches of high pressure are held in place by alterations to a jet stream that normally pushes weather systems from west to east. “But when these heat domes do happen, they are getting worse, that’s for certain,” said Michael Wehner, a climate and extreme weather expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who estimated that the Texas heatwave was made around 2.7C (5F) hotter by human-caused global heating. A swath of severe wind gusts and isolated very large hail are probable across a portion of northeast Wyoming into western South Dakota, according to the National Storm Prediction Center. Scattered damaging winds from strong to isolated severe gusts are likely across parts of the lower mid-Atlantic states through early evening, it says. As of Monday afternoon, nearly 200,000 homes and businesses are without power, including nearly 50,000 in Missouri, according to Poweroutage.us. More than 30 cows were killed on Saturday in a northern Alabama town when lightning struck the tree they were hiding under, according to officials. WVTM reported that the beef cattle were sheltering from a severe storm on Daymin Gardner’s farm in Berlin, when lightning struck the tree. The father’s brother told WVTM that the meat on the cows was not salvageable and they would be given a proper burial. Saturday’s storms brought torrential rain, hail and lightning to central Alabama. The National Weather Service (NWS) said seeking shelter under a tree is one of the leading causes of lightning-related fatalities. More than 80m people are under severe storm threat ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, CNN reported. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected through much of the eastern US, with chances of flash flooding in some areas from the lower Great Lakes to southern New England, the National Weather Service said in an update Monday. A slight risk for severe storms, level two of five, stretches from northern South Carolina to southern New Jersey, including Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charlotte, Washington DC and Virginia Beach. Cities including Jackson, Birmingham, Atlanta, Charleston, Roanoke, Newark and New York are all under a marginal risk for severe storms. A separate storm system is bringing another slight risk of severe weather across parts of the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana and Minnesota. NBC news cited the National Weather Service as saying: The chance of showers and thunderstorms will generally decrease through the eastern US on Independence Day as the low pressure system is forecast to weaken further. Weekend thunderstorms in Chicago flooded streets and highways on Sunday, forcing Nascar officials to call off the remainder of the Xfinity Series race in the city’s downtown area. The National Weather Service recorded 3.35in of rain on Sunday, shattering the city’s previous record for that day of 2.06in set in 1982. Some parts of the Chicago area received up to 9in during the storm on Sunday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. To put it into perspective, the average amount of rain in July for the city is 3.7in, the paper said. The Nascar Cup Series main event began late in the day on Sunday due to local flash flood warnings, and after the National Weather Service sent another emergency alert regarding the “life-threatening” flash flood warning. As of Monday, 36m people are under excessive heat warnings in the US, particularly in the south and western areas, ABC News reported. Phoenix, Arizona’s capital city, is expected to hit a high temperature of 116F on Monday, the Associated Press reported, as temperatures remained above 100F throughout the weekend and, dangerously, are not coming down much at night, giving little relief and straining power systems as residents try to stay cool. America’s fifth largest city, with 1.6 million people, is accustomed to a hot desert climate, but temperatures are rising due to global heating and urban development which has created a sprawling asphalt and concrete heat island that traps heat especially at night. Read the Guardian’s report on how Phoenix residents suffered intolerable night-time temperatures during its first extreme heatwave of the season in June 2022. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. A heat advisory is expected to last through Tuesday, with heat index readings reaching as high as 120F last week and evening temperatures in the 80s offering little reprieve. The city of New Orleans announced that cooling centers will be open for residents to escape the heat throughout the weekend. Louisiana’s high humidity makes it even harder for the body to cool down during high temperatures, said Alicia Van Doren, who helped write a recent report for the Louisiana department of health about heat-related illnesses in the state. High humidity levels in the air prevent sweat from evaporating, impeding the body’s mechanism to stay cool. Van Doren said: So when that internal heat production exceeds the heat loss, the body reaches a point that it can no longer sustain its natural thermal regulation. That’s when core temps start to rise and heat stroke occurs. Since 1 April, more than 1,200 people have gone to emergency departments in the state for heat-related illnesses, according to Louisiana department of health, or LDH, data. A report published by the LDH last month found that workers – especially those in agriculture, construction, landscaping, transportation and utilities – are among the most at-risk populations for heat-related illnesses because they have less control over the amount of time they spend under the sun. About 320 workers are taken to the hospital for heat-related illnesses in the state every year, according to the report. Black workers were hospitalized for heat-related illness at double the rate of white workers. Good morning. Welcome back to our coverage of the extreme weather impacting tens of millions across the US. Excessive heat warnings remain in place in many areas across the country and are expected to last through the week. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. On Sunday, heat index values threatened to hit 110F in New Orleans, according to the National Weather Service. In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures are expected to rise above 110F all week, after reaching 115F on Sunday – eight degrees above normal for this time of the year and approaching the record of 118F set in 2011. The onset of night will offer little relief from the sweltering heat, with night-time temperatures not expected to fall below the 80F necessary for the body to recover from the cumulative impact of heat. The current heatwave was made five times more likely by climate change, according to an analysis by Climate Central. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of residents in central Illinois remain without power after severe storms knocked down trees and power lines across the region. Heavy rains flooded Chicago on Sunday, trapping cars and flooding basements across the city. The National Weather Service warned the flooding could be “life-threatening”. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates from across the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T15:37:43Z","webTitle":"Sunak’s failing windfall tax enabling oil giants to avoid paying billions, say Labour and Lib Dems – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: A taskforce has been launched to ensure the UK has the right skills in the nuclear industry as part of government plans to drastically scale up nuclear capacity. The panel will work to ensure roles are filled in the rapidly expanding defence and civil nuclear sectors, the Ministry of Defence said. The government’s plan to triple Britain’s nuclear power generation capacity by 2050 badly lacks the strategy to actually achieve it, according to a report published on Monday. In the report, the science, innovation and technology committee backed the decision to look to nuclear power as a way to meet the UK’s electricity needs amid the race to net zero but ministers need to be clear on how they propose to get there in order to encourage investment, the committee said. Rishi Sunak has pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves as he revealed a new round of intensive North Sea drilling, which experts said could be catastrophic for the climate. Unveiling a plan to authorise more than 100 new North Sea licences on a visit to north-east Scotland, the prime minister also indicated he would approve drilling at the UK’s largest untapped reserves in the Rosebank field, which hold 500m barrels of oil. Opposition parties say the government is failing to act as oil companies continue to rake in massive profits, despite oil and gas prices coming down from last year’s highs. The Liberal Democrats are calling for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Climate activists have sprayed part of the Scottish parliament building red in a protest against the prime minister announcing plans for 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Protesters from the This Is Rigged pressure group sprayed the entrance red. A billionaire global investor has led international condemnation of the UK’s new oil rush, saying he would pull his major investment from the country if the prime minister pursued “clickbait” fossil fuel policies. A UK government minister has said he “cannot put a timeframe” on when the Home Office will open a controversial giant barge meant to house asylum seekers, which has been further delayed for checks. The initial plan had been to move people on to the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, from this week, with numbers due to rise over the coming months until the vessel held about 500 men. Jeremy Hunt oversaw the signing of a low-tax treaty with San Marino championed by a leading Tory donor, who with his companies has given more than £700,000 to the party and £30,000 to the chancellor. Maurizio Bragagni, a prominent businessman and diplomat for San Marino, was present in No 11 when a “double taxation” treaty between the UK and San Marino was signed in May. We’re closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us and for all the comments and emails. You can follow our liveblog on the Ukraine-Russia war here: A billionaire global investor has led international condemnation of the UK’s new oil rush, saying he would pull his major investment from the country if the prime minister pursued “clickbait” fossil fuel policies. The Australian mining entrepreneur Andrew Forrest, who also runs the Minderoo Foundation philanthropic organisation, threatened to move his investments out of the UK over Rishi Sunak’s swivel towards new oil and gas drilling. Forrest told Bloomberg News: I am a major investor here. If I see this country steering itself over a cliff backing fossil fuel, I am going to start pulling out. I will push my investments over to North America … I must invest where I know I have proper leadership, not leadership which is on a clickbait cycle. The prime minister’s announcement that more than 100 new oil and gas drilling licences would be granted for the North Sea in the autumn has sparked condemnation from climate scientists, energy experts and some within his own party. The push for oil and gas is in direct conflict with international experts including those at the International Energy Agency and the International Institute for Sustainable Development who say oil and gas exploration must stop if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The return to fossil fuel drilling puts the UK at odds with a string of European countries including Ireland, Denmark and Spain, who have already announced bans on new oil and gas exploration in order to tackle climate breakdown. Michael Bloss, a Green MEP from Germany, said the UK had lost all credibility: The UK has lost its leadership on this issue. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there must not be new fossil fuel exploration in order to try and keep [the goal of limiting heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels] alive. Read more from my colleagues Sandra Laville, Oliver Milman, Nina Lakhani and Ajit Niranjan here: Rishi Sunak suggested focus should be on the “values that are at stake” in the de-banking row rather than on individuals. The prime minister said his “primary concern” was the wider impact of the issue and how it affects other people when asked about the fallout following Nigel Farage’s claim that his Coutts account was unfairly shut down, PA news reports. He refused to be drawn when asked whether current NatWest chair, Sir Howard Davies, should consider his position, telling GB News: I think it’s good that Nigel Farage and Coutts are in dialogue resolving the issue there, but Nigel Farage also spoke about the broader issue of this impacting other people, and that’s my primary concern, because ultimately this isn’t about any one individual, this is about values. Values that are important to me and important to our country... Rather than the individuals, to focus on the values that are at stake. Values of freedom of expression and privacy. I believe in those values very strongly. People need to be able to have lawfully held views that we might not agree with, but they shouldn’t be denied financial services because of them. And they’re entitled for their financial affairs to be kept private. A publican who heckled Rishi Sunak criticised the prime minister’s “audacity” for visiting a London beer festival on the day of an alcohol duty increase. Rudi Keyser, who runs a pub in Wimbledon, told the PA news agency: The amount of breweries that have shut down in the last year has been phenomenal. Plus on August 1 today they are raising alcohol duty across the board significantly. And I run a pub as part of a big national chain and we’ve been bulk buying in the last two weeks to avoid the alcohol duty increase. And he has the audacity to come and pull a pint for PR. Keyser said the “draught relief” announced by the prime minister was “smoke and mirrors” and consumers would be hit with a rise in prices. He said: It’s robbing Peter to pay Paul. So across the board, it’s all going up. I can tell you from my side now in the trade, the consumer is going to see an increase. Chris Skidmore wrote a report “praising the government for its leadership on climate change”, the prime minister has said. Rishi Sunak’s comments came after the Tory former energy minister and chair of the UK’s net-zero review condemned his decision to give the green light to more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, accusing him of being on the “wrong side of history”. Asked about Skidmore’s comments at the Great British beer festival in west London’s Olympia exhibition centre, Sunak told broadcasters: He also wrote a report praising the government for its leadership on climate change. Yesterday was about strengthening our energy security, the independent assessment says that even when you meet net zero in 2050, around a quarter of our energy needs will still come from oil and gas. Rishi Sunak said Bibby Stockholm, the barge for asylum seekers, was going through a series of checks before it can house people following a delay. The Guardian reported on Monday that the first people in Portland, Dorset, were due to be moved onboard the vessel on Wednesday but that seems to have been delayed further with the minister now unwilling to put a timeframe on the move. Speaking to broadcasters at the Great British beer festival in west London’s Olympia exhibition centre, the prime minister said: All migrant accommodation has to go through a series of checks and inspections to make sure it complies with regulation, that’s what’s happening in this case. But let’s take a step back, this is ultimately about fairness. I don’t think it’s fair that British taxpayers are forking out six million quid a day to house illegal migrants in hotels – I want to put an end to that. Climate activists have sprayed part of the Scottish parliament building red in a protest against the prime minister announcing plans for 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Protesters from the This Is Rigged pressure group sprayed the entrance red. The group said on Twitter: “(The Scottish Government’s) silence on new oil and gas is deafening. They must vocally oppose all new oil and gas, or they are complicit.” This Is Rigged said four of their activists were involved. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We were made aware of protesters at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh shortly after 1.40pm on Tuesday August 1. Officers are in attendance.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he understood people would be “frustrated” by hearing about the level of profits for energy companies, but recalled the introduction of a windfall tax on energy firms during his time as chancellor. He said: “We’re using that money to help pay for people’s energy bills.” As we reported earlier, opposition parties have said that the government was failing to act as oil companies continue to rake in massive profits even though oil and gas prices have come down from last year’s highs. BP on Tuesday reported it had made around $2.59bn (£2bn) in underlying replacement cost profit over the three months to the end of June. Sunak was speaking at the Great British beer festival at Olympia in London to highlight a shake-up of alcohol duty. He said the centrepiece of the alcohol duty reforms is “backing British pubs”. He said: Now that we’ve left the EU, we can ensure that the tax we pay for beer on draft in pubs is lower, less than the tax we pay for beer in the supermarket. But we’re also planning to simplify the system so that the lower the alcohol in the drink, the less tax you pay. He added “most people would agree with that as a common sense principle” and “there is something for everyone” in the overhaul. “We’re also growing the economy by cutting taxes for small producers so they can expand and employ more people.” Sunak was heckled as he toured the festival. He was pouring a pint of Black Dub stout at the stall of the Wensleydale brewery, which operates from his constituency, when an onlooker called out: “Prime Minister, oh the irony that you’re raising alcohol duty on the day that you’re pulling a pint,” PA reports. Another man shouted at the teetotal Tory leader, who is famously a fan of carbonated soft drinks: “Prime Minister, it’s not Coca Cola.” A new system taxing all alcohol based on its strength has seen taxes rise for some types of drink. An organisation representing British Muslims has called for a review into banking practices over concerns about the “arbitrary closure” of accounts. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has written to the prime minister, chancellor and others urging the protection of universal banking rights, irrespective of someone’s religious or cultural background or political views. PA reports that the group said “many law-abiding Muslim individuals and Muslim-led organisations” have been “gravely impacted by the arbitrary withdrawal of banking services” and argued that it had “become par for the course over the past decade” with no action taken to address it. Banks are facing the prospect of widespread reforms to account closures after the Nigel Farage de-banking row that last week led to the resignation of the NatWest chief executive, Dame Alison Rose. The MCB said British Muslims had been disproportionately affected by the issue of bank accounts being closed down for many years. The organisation also sent its letter to leaders of opposition parties as well as the permanent secretary to the Treasury. It stated: Your decisive intervention calling for change at the NatWest group, following the recent denial of banking services to Nigel Farage, is of note. For British Muslims and Muslim-led organisations however, the arbitrary withdrawal of banking services by different UK banks has become par for the course over the past decade. The practice has continued unhindered, with limited transparency into the relevant banking systems and decision-making processes, little to no recourse for those impacted and no action taken by successive governments to address any of the aforementioned. It added that “significant cause for concern” remains “that many British Muslims and Muslim-led organisations have somehow been determined to be a potential risk” despite a lack of “validated evidence of any criminal activity”. Zara Mohammed, the MCB secretary general, said: We urge for an impartial review that not only addresses the mechanisms behind bank account closures but also examines why British Muslims are disproportionately affected by this issue. Our affiliates are ready to share their experiences and recommendations to ensure fair treatment for all. We call for the protection of universal banking rights, irrespective of religious or cultural backgrounds and political views, ensuring equitable access to financial services for all. Boris Johnson may finally be out of political hot water, but plans to erect an outdoor swimming pool at his Oxfordshire home have been disrupted by a population of great crested newts. Since leaving frontline politics, the former prime minister has been keen to press ahead with improvements to the home he purchased in May and has been living in with his wife, Carrie, and their three children. However, it seems that the great crested newt, against which Johnson railed when he was in No 10 and accused of being “a massive drag on the prosperity of this country”, has had its revenge. The UK’s largest newt, which takes its name from the striking jagged crest that males display in the spring breeding season, is a protected species under British law. As such, an unlimited fine and up to six months in prison could await anyone found guilty of disturbing the newt’s resting places and breeding sites, or taking their eggs. Johnson launched an application with South Oxfordshire district council in June for the construction of an outdoor pool, measuring 11 metres by 4 metres (36ft x 13ft). But Edward Church, a local government ecologist who reviewed the application, did not recommend granting permission for the pool to be built because there are great crested newts living in the grounds. Read more here: Opposition parties say the government is failing to act as oil companies continue to rake in massive profits, despite oil and gas prices coming down from last year’s highs. BP on Tuesday reported net profits of $2.6bn (£2bn) for the three months to the end of June. Despite it being more than two-thirds lower than last year’s results, it sparked further criticism of how the government has handled an industry which has benefited significantly from Vladimir Putin’s full-scale war on Ukraine and the spike in world energy prices that followed, PA Media reports. Ed Miliband said: These figures demonstrate the continuing scandal of the Tory failure to act on the windfalls of war being pocketed by the oil and gas producers. The shadow climate and net zero secretary added that Rishi Sunak “should start by fixing the gaping loopholes in the windfall tax on oil and gas profits, not handing them out billions of taxpayer subsidy. Labour would bring in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants to help tackle the cost-of-living crisis, alongside our plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower so we can lower bills for families and businesses. The government has put a windfall tax on the profits that oil and gas companies make from the North Sea. However, it has included the ability to reduce the tax if the companies invest, something the opposition has called a “loophole”. The Lib Dems earlier called for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies despite the recent fall in energy prices. In a statement, Sarah Olney, the party’s Treasury spokesperson, said: The government shouldn’t be hoodwinked to remove the windfall tax by this profit drop. Let’s be frank, these are still huge. No family should go cold next winter because the government backed down on taxing the likes of BP. It is time to put the needs of struggling families and pensioners over the wallets of global oil firms. A year ago BP made $8.5bn in profits, when it was boosted by a surge in oil and gas prices. BP blamed the decline in profits on planned maintenance work and lower margins in its refining business. The industry has also faced a gradual reduction in the price of fossil fuels, especially natural gas. Yet it still revealed plans to hand more cash to investors through higher dividends and a further share buyback. It comes a week after rival oil major Shell also delivered weaker-than-expected profits for its latest quarter. Jeremy Hunt oversaw the signing of a low-tax treaty with San Marino championed by a leading Tory donor, who with his companies has given more than £700,000 to the party and £30,000 to the chancellor. Maurizio Bragagni, a prominent businessman and diplomat for San Marino, was present in No 11 when a “double taxation” treaty between the UK and San Marino was signed in May. After the event, Hunt took time out to pose for photographs outside No 11 Downing Street with Bragagni and San Marino’s foreign secretary. Whitehall sources said San Marino had for at least two years been lobbying the government through the Foreign Office to negotiate and sign such a treaty but that the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs make the decision on which countries to prioritise. A Treasury spokesperson said Hunt had no involvement in the negotiation of the treaty, which was done by HMRC officials, and that the original request for a deal was made by the Foreign Office in 2022 – six months before he became chancellor. They said the process in the Treasury was led by Victoria Atkins, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who signed the document with Bragagni inside No 11. When the tax treaty was signed, the consulate praised the work of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on San Marino, comprising MPs and peers, for its “continuous lobbying support” in relation to the UK government on the issue. Hunt is a former member of the APPG on San Marino and visited the small landlocked state surrounded by Italy in 2021, declaring hospitality from San Marino for four members of his family and himself, flights, accommodation and food with a total value of £7,869 over three days. Bragagni was present on the 2021 visit, during which Hunt was awarded an honour by San Marino known as the order of the Knights of St Agatha. At the time, San Marino said it had recognised “Grand Officer” Jeremy Hunt for his “merits in promoting San Marino’s best interests in the UK, for his valuable support during the emergency situation created in the Republic during the pandemic”. Here’s more from my colleagues Rowena Mason and Henry Dyer here: The average number of migrants crossing the Channel per boat last month was the highest on record, figures show. About 3,299 people made the journey in July in 63 boats – an average of about 52 per vessel. This is the highest average since records began in 2018, according to PA news agency analysis of government data. The third highest average – 47 – was reached in October last year when 147 boats carried 6,900 people in a month. Provisional Home Office figures show 14,732 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year. But no arrivals have been recorded in nearly a week amid poor weather conditions at sea. The 2023 total to date is 10% lower than the 16,434 recorded from January to July last year. The figures come as plans to move asylum seekers on to a giant barge on the Dorset coast have been beset by delays. Facing questions on Sky News, transport minister Richard Holden said he “can’t put a timeframe” on when migrants will board the Bibby Stockholm in Portland. The Home Office was reportedly due to send the first group of people to the accommodation on Tuesday, but the date was pushed back to Wednesday to give more time for final inspections amid concerns about fire safety. Downing Street said final preparations were under way this week. Meanwhile, media reports cited sources warning Border Force is braced for a surge in Channel crossings in August amid fears that beach patrols could be scaled back while French police officers take time off work. But the French government has assured the Home Office that patrols funded by the UK government under a multimillion-pound deal earlier this year will not be affected, the Times reports. Keir Starmer should hold his nerve on the Lords reform or we’ll never see the back of Boris Johnson’s cronies, writes Frances Ryan in this opinion piece. Bad news for fans of unelected legislatures: Labour is considering abolishing hereditary peers. According to the Sunday Times, Keir Starmer is drawing up plans that could see the immediate removal of hereditary peers if the party is elected, as part of a package of “interim” reforms to modernise and reduce the size of the House of Lords. Other moves being explored include introducing a mandatory retirement age or stopping hereditary peer byelections (so the current peers can’t be replaced after they leave). For the section of the British press who feel terror at the prospect of a Labour government, discussions of Lords “reform” is essentially one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Rather than fire and brimstone, the warning signs are questioning hereditary peers, ending private school tax breaks, decent public services and tackling child poverty (well, maybe not that last one quite yet). Despite decades of debate, the Labour party’s previous attempts to quash the Lords have never been fully successful. In 1999, Tony Blair’s government managed to end the 700-year-old right for all peers to sit and vote. This got the number of hereditary peers down from 750 but political pressure meant 92 remained, like a particularly stubborn mildew. And yet it feels like the tide may be turning. Last week, Boris Johnson’s former aides, Charlotte Owen and Ross Kempsell, were sworn in as life peers to widespread criticism, even among their own party. Few moments highlight the need for Lords reform better than the sight of people with barely a decade of work experience making laws for the next 60 years, and for no other reason than it was the whim of a man who nicknamed himself “Big Dog”. Read the full piece here: The Liberal Democrats are calling for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies despite the recent fall in energy prices after BP reported £2bn in net profit for the second quarter of the year. BP has reported net profits of $2.6bn (£2bn) for the three months to the end of June as the climate crisis triggers extreme heatwaves, angering climate campaigners. The company blamed falling oil and gas markets for the drop in profits from $8.5bn in the same period last year when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ignited a rise in global energy markets. BP will increase its shareholder dividends by 10% to $2.3bn, despite the fall in profits. It will also return a further $1.5bn to investors through a share buyback over the next three months. The Lib Dems say the “monster profits” will be a “nasty shock to families who couldn’t afford to heat their homes this year”. In a statement, Sarah Olney, the party’s Treasury spokesperson, said: The government shouldn’t be hoodwinked to remove the windfall tax by this profit drop. Let’s be frank, these are still huge. No family should go cold next winter because the government backed down on taxing the likes of BP. It is time to put the needs of struggling families and pensioners over the wallets of global oil firms. The prime minister’s press secretary was asked if there would be a review of the windfall tax yesterday but she wouldn’t comment “specifically on tax, particularly ahead of a fiscal event”. More broadly, she told reporters: What the windfall tax has done has raised over £6bn since it was introduced, which has helped to fund consumer help with their energy bills of on average about £3,300 per household. That remains the policy and I don’t have anything more to add on the future of that. Global oil and gas market prices have tumbled since reaching a peak last year. The global oil price averaged $76.60 a barrel in the last quarter, down sharply from an average of about $112 a barrel in the second quarter of last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Nigel Farage has said that the newly installed boss of Coutts has offered to keep his accounts there open, reversing a decision that triggered a scandal and the resignation of the private bank’s previous chief executive. The former Ukip leader said he welcomed the offer but was still taking legal action against NatWest, which owns Coutts, demanding compensation, a full apology and a face-to-face meeting with the banking group’s bosses. Peter Flavel resigned as Coutts chief executive last Thursday, less than two days after the NatWest boss, Alison Rose, also stepped down over her role in the row. Flavel has been replaced by Mohammed Syed. “The new CEO of Coutts … has written to me to say I can keep both my personal and my business accounts, and that’s good, and I thank him for it,” Farage said on GB News on Monday night. But enormous harm has been done to me over the course of the last few months … It has taken up a huge amount of my time and it has cost me, so far, quite a lot of money in legal fees. So I have today sent a legal litigation letter to Coutts, where I want some full apologies, I want some compensation for my cost. “But more important than all of that, I want a face-to-face meeting with the bank’s bosses. I want to find out how many other people in Coutts or NatWest have had accounts closed because of their political opinions. And I want to make sure this never happens to anybody else ever again. Farage obtained documents from Coutts showing that while he had been below the bank’s “commercial criteria” for some time – referring to its requirement to hold £1m in investments or loans, or £3m in savings – the decision to shut his accounts was also based on concerns that his “xenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views” posed a risk to its reputation. Banks are not allowed to shut accounts or deny services because of customers’ political views or beliefs. Farage did not clarify whether he had accepted Coutts’s offer to keep his account open. NatWest Group said it could not comment on individual customers. A UK government minister has said he “cannot put a timeframe” on when the Home Office will open a controversial giant barge meant to house asylum seekers, which has been further delayed for checks. The initial plan had been to move people on to the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, from this week, with numbers due to rise over the coming months until the vessel held about 500 men. Asked on Sky News when the barge would be available, the transport minister Richard Holden said: It’s going through its final checks at the moment. It’s right that … whatever accommodation we provide is safe and secure as well. I can’t put a timeframe on it. Asked if safety concerns were delaying the opening, he said: It’s going through final checks at the moment. With anything you would want them to be properly checked out. The Guardian reported on Monday that the first asylum seekers were due to be moved onboard the vessel on Wednesday but that seems to have been delayed further with the minister now unwilling to put a timeframe on the move. Asked if it would be delayed as long as the Rwanda policy had taken to implement, Holden added: I can’t comment on the ongoing process of checks and things that have to take place but it is my understanding (it is) in its final checks. Fears had been expressed that the barge could become a “floating Grenfell” and endanger the lives of vulnerable people who have fled hardship and war as it has not received the relevant safety signoff. About 40 claimants staying in other Home Office accommodation had received transfer letters saying they would be moved to the 222-cabin vessel in Dorset, Whitehall sources said. More than 50 national organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Asylum Matters and Refugee Action, have called the government’s plan “cruel and inhumane”. They said the vessel was “entirely inappropriate” and would house traumatised migrants in “detention-like conditions”. Read more here: Rishi Sunak has pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves as he revealed a new round of intensive North Sea drilling, which experts said could be catastrophic for the climate. Unveiling a plan to authorise more than 100 new North Sea licences on a visit to north-east Scotland, the prime minister also indicated he would approve drilling at the UK’s largest untapped reserves in the Rosebank field, which hold 500m barrels of oil. Speaking to reporters on a visit to a Shell gas terminal north of Aberdeen, Sunak insisted the plan was compatible with net zero commitments given the anticipated part-reliance on fossil fuels for years to come, saying it was more carbon-intensive to ship oil and gas from other countries. But experts said this ignored the fact that much of the UK’s imported gas comes by pipeline and tends to be produced more cleanly than its British equivalent. Environmental groups said Sunak’s plan would “send a wrecking ball” through climate commitments. Tory and Labour MPs said Sunak’s “economically illiterate” announcement was “driving a coach and horses” through previous promises, and warned the prime minister he was “on the wrong side of history” and that modern voters wanted leaders who “protect, and not threaten, our environment”. While the new round of licences has been in progress for many weeks, Sunak’s visit highlights the shift towards greater scepticism over green policies since the Conservatives narrowly won the Uxbridge byelection, thanks in part to concern about London’s soon-to-be-expanded ultra-low emission zone. The new round of licences will permit drilling closer to existing projects than previously allowed, something Sunak’s press secretary said was intended to maximise the amount that could be extracted. While Sunak has insisted he remains committed to the UK’s target to reach net zero by 2050 and other green targets, his new approach has prompted concern among some Tory MPs, who worry the party could suffer among young voters and those tempted by the Liberal Democrats. Read the full story from my colleagues Severin Carrell, Peter Walker and Helena Horton here: The government’s plan to triple Britain’s nuclear power generation capacity by 2050 badly lacks the strategy to actually achieve it, according to a report published on Monday. In the report, the science, innovation and technology committee backed the decision to look to nuclear power as a way to meet the UK’s electricity needs amid the race to net zero but ministers need to be clear on how they propose to get there in order to encourage investment, the committee said. It warned that the government’s own most recent energy security plan, published in March, offers little clue about how measures will be implemented. The committee chair, Greg Clark, noted that the “stretching” ambitions to achieve 24GW of nuclear power by 2050 would be almost double the highest level of nuclear generation the UK has ever attained. He said: The only way to achieve this is to translate these very high-level aspirations into a comprehensive, concrete and detailed nuclear strategic plan which is developed jointly with the nuclear industry, which enjoys long-term cross-party political commitment and which therefore offers dependability for private and public investment decisions. A taskforce has been launched to ensure the UK has the right skills in the nuclear industry as part of government plans to drastically scale up nuclear capacity. The panel will work to ensure roles are filled in the rapidly expanding defence and civil nuclear sectors, the Ministry of Defence said. It will develop a national skills strategy for jobs across the industry, from technical scientific and engineering roles to logistics, project management, commercial and finance, PA Media reports. The taskforce will be chaired by Sir Simon Bollom, the former chief executive of Defence Equipment and Support, and include government officials, academics and industry partners. The defence procurement minister, James Cartlidge, said: By developing nuclear skills, we are not just investing in the UK economy but our national security. The creation of this new taskforce will challenge the whole of the UK’s nuclear sector to be ambitious in addressing the nuclear skills gap, and we are delighted to appoint Sir Simon Bollom to drive this work forward. Bollom said: The nuclear sector is vital to our nation, and I am proud to have been given the opportunity to lead such an important taskforce to ensure that we have the people and skills we need to deliver our programmes. The nuclear minister, Andrew Bowie, hailed a nuclear “revival” with the launch of Great British Nuclear, an arm’s-length body involved in the government-backed competition to develop smaller-scale nuclear technology projects.

The power networks owner said last month that Britain should be able to meet its energy needs this winter but could experience rolling power cuts in a worst-case scenario if Russia cut off gas supplies into Europe. Its chief executive, John Pettigrew, said on Thursday that the outlook had not changed, and the mild weather so far this winter was a positive for the energy picture. “What we have seen is pretty mild weather, which has led the Europeans to probably put more gas into storage than they originally anticipated. My understanding is the storage in Europe now is pretty much full,” he said. Last year the Sellindge converter station in Kent was forced to shut down a high-voltage cable that brings electricity from France after a huge fire. Half of its 2,000 gigawatt (GW) capacity was knocked out by the fire. Pettigrew said 500 megawatts would be restored this month and the remaining 500MW in December. “So by the time we get to the peak of the winter, the full 2GW will be available from the French interconnector, which I’m delighted about,” he said. National Grid reported a 50% rise in operating profits to £2.24bn in the six months to 30 September, buoyed up by extra revenues from its acquisition of the network operator Western Power Distribution. Its earnings were also boosted by a “strong performance” in its New York and New England business, plus the insurance proceeds from the Sellindge fire. Pettigrew stressed that the company did not produce or sell energy and was not recording the windfall profits of some oil and gas producers. Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, are reportedly considering extending the windfall tax on those firms and curbing the revenues of electricity generators. Pettigrew said he understood Sunak and Hunt’s focus on tax and spending “to balance the UK plc books” but said: “What we need is a stable policy regime, a stable regulatory regime and a stable financial regime.” National Grid increased its investment target to £40bn by 2026, up from a previous goal of £30bn to £35bn. The firm said £29bn of this would be in “the decarbonisation of energy networks”. “Connecting renewables and decarbonisation is an absolute focus. That’s a huge investment programme, £1m an hour, every single hour of every single day, 365 days a year,” he said. “Connecting clean energy at scale and pace will bring down energy bills for customers and increase energy security.” Pettigrew said the “vast majority” of suppliers in the UK had now signed up to a scheme launched last week to incentivise households to shift their power usage outside peak times this winter. The Guardian reported last week that E.ON, EDF and the British Gas owner, Centrica, had said they planned to participate in the scheme, which was first piloted by Octopus Energy. “We’re really pleased with the take-up. It will continue to grow as we move through the winter,” Pettigrew said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T16:41:16Z","webTitle":"Biden to scrap Trump missile project but critics attack US ‘nuclear overkill’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/27/biden-trump-missile-nuclear-posture-review","fields":{"bodyText":"The Biden administration has confirmed it will cancel a submarine-launched nuclear cruise missile programme begun by Donald Trump, as part of its review of nuclear policy. The administration will also retire a gravity bomb, the B83-1, from its arsenal as part of its Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), but arms control advocates argued the changes from the Trump era did not go far enough. The administration is retaining another weapon variant introduced by Trump, a low-yield warhead called the W76-2, intended to deter an adversary like Russia using a low-yield weapon. The Democratic party manifesto in 2020 had called the W76-2 “unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible”. The Biden NPR said that the “fundamental role of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners”. That declaratory policy stops sort of saying deterring nuclear attack is the sole purpose of the arsenal, which is what Biden promised in his election campaign. Instead, the NPR says that the US could strike back against “a narrow range of other high consequence, strategic-level attacks”. Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and nonproliferation issues, expressed disappointment in the Biden NPR. “The world is a dangerous place and our allies and we still rely on nuclear deterrence but this document ignores the role the US can play to make nukes less usable, less likely,” Wolfsthal said on Twitter. The policy document points to arms control agreements as offering “the most effective, durable and responsible path to achieving a key goal: reducing the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy.” It undertakes to uphold the last remaining arms control agreement with Russia, the New Start treaty, and negotiate a successor agreement when it expires in 2026, but it adds: “negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith”. The NPR points out that as well as strategic weapons subject to the limits of New Start, Russia has an active stockpile of up to 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, warheads, of the sort Vladimir Putin and his officials have hinted could be used against Ukraine. The US only has a few hundred tactical weapons. “Similarly, Russia is pursuing several novel nuclear-capable systems designed to hold the US homeland or allies and partners at risk, some of which are also not accountable under New Start,” the NPR said. The document repeats an earlier US estimate that China will have 1,000 deliverable warheads by the end of the decade, so that by the 2030s the US “will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries.” Introducing the National Defence Strategy, in which the NPR is a part, the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, described China as America’s “pacing challenge” while Russia was an “immediate and sharp threat” which “could not systemically challenge the US over the long term”. The NPR leaves open the possibility that the US might have to increase its arsenal as a result of the dual threat from China and Russia, saying that “as the security environment evolves, it may be necessary to consider nuclear strategy and force adjustments to assure our ability to achieve deterrence.” In response to the NPR, Jessica Sleight, partner for policy at Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group, said: “Contrary to President Biden’s stated intentions to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, this Nuclear Posture Review continues decades of nuclear overkill, doubles down on needless weapons programs, and fails to advance overdue reforms to policy and posture that would make the United States, its allies, and the world safer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"World Bank announces additional $4.5bn in Ukraine aid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: The United States will provide an additional $4.5 billion (£3.7 bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5 billion (£7 bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3 billion (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for following along. The Pentagon has unveiled the latest billion dollar slice of US military aid to Ukraine. The main items are more ammunition for the 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) the US has sent, as well as new missiles for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), a thousand Javelin anti-tank missiles, and hundreds of Swedish made AT4 shoulder launched anti-tank systems. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, noted it was the 18th drawdown on US military stocks sent to Ukraine, making a total of $9.8bn in security assistance so far under the Biden administration. “This is the largest single drawdown of US arms and equipment utilizing this authority to date,” Kahl said. “The package provides a significant amount of additional ammunition, weapons and equipment, the types of which the Ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country.” Kahl said the rockets (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS) the US has been sending to Ukraine to fire from the Himars mobile launch vehicles, are “having a very profound effect”. “This is a 200 pound warhead. It’s kind of the equivalent of an airstrike, frankly, a precision guided airstrike,” he said. “These are GPS-guided munitions. They’ve been very effective in hitting things that previously the Ukrainians had difficulty hitting reliably - so command-and-control nodes, sustainment and logistics hubs, key radar systems and other things. And what it’s done is it’s made it more difficult for the Russians to move forces around the battlefield. “They’ve had to move certain assets back away from the Himars. It slowed them down. It’s made it harder for them to resupply other forces. So I think it’s having real operational effects.” He estimated Russian casualties as 70,000 to 80,000 dead and wounded. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Reuters reported: It follows previous transfers of $1.7bn in July and $1.3bn in June, USAid said. Washington has also provided billions of dollars in military support, and plans a new $1bn weapons package shortly. The U.S. funds are to help the Ukrainian government maintain essential functions, including social and financial assistance for the growing poor population, children with disabilities, and millions of internally displaced persons, as the war drags on. Ukrainian officials estimate the country faces a $5bn-a-month fiscal shortfall - or 2.5% of pre-war gross domestic product - due to the cost of the war and declining tax revenues. Economists say that will swell Ukraine’s annual deficit to 25% of GDP, compared with 3.5% before the conflict. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war and the large numbers of displaced persons, compared with 2.5% before the start of the war. Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The assertions could not be independently verified by Reuters and there was no immediate reaction to the Ukraine statement from Moscow or Russian state-run media. The suspects, one a resident of the eastern Luhansk region held by Russia-backed separatists and the other a resident of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, were promised up to $150,000 (£124,000) by Russian handlers for the murder of each of their targets, the SBU said. The man from Luhansk region entered Ukraine from Belarus and was detained in the city of Kovel in north-west Ukraine along with the Kyiv resident, the statement said. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitskyi, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” he said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Workers at the nuclear complex are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia complex, adding that damage to the facility from Russian attacks means any radiation could not be detected. Tsymbaliuk spoke in Vienna as international alarm over artillery attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant grew, with Kyiv warning of the risk of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe and appealing for the area to be made a demilitarised zone, Reuters reported. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Reuters reported that she went on to say: “They are taking the whole of Europe hostage and are not against setting fire to it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” Ukraine’s atomic energy agency Energoatom is quoting Dmytro Lubinets, the country’s human rights ombudsman, on its official Telegram channel. It says: The Russian Federation continues acts of nuclear terrorism in relation to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) facilities and its personnel. According to the information of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is currently mined, and individual employees of the station are subject to torture and enforced disappearance, and they receive threats. This poses a threat to the lives of employees and prevents the normal operation of the facility. As the commissioner for human rights of the parliament of Ukraine, I first of all declare the flagrant threat posed by the presence of the Russian military in Zaporizhzhia NPP not only for tens of millions of Ukrainians, but also for the whole world. The destructive consequences of nuclear terrorism and the spread of radioactivity do not ‘respect’ state borders, and radioactive emissions spread uncontrollably, the consequences of radioactive pollution remain for decades. Once again, I call on the secretary general of the UN, the IAEA and the entire world community to take all possible measures to send a security mission to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, to completely demilitarise the territory of the NPP, and to provide security guarantees to the employees of the nuclear plant and residents of the city. Reuters is carrying an opposing line from the Russian side. It quotes Russia’s foreign ministry as saying western nations are unwilling to point the finger of blame for the alleged shelling of the plant at Ukrainian forces, and that while Russia sees the IAEA’s request to inspect Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv has an interest in not allowing the inspection to take place. Ukraine has previously objected to the idea that the IAEA would visit Zaporizhzhia, as they fear it would lend legitimacy and normalise Russia’s occupation of the facility and the territory that surrounds it. For their part, if Ukraine’s claims that staff are being mistreated there are true, then Russia also has a vested interest in avoiding an inspection that might reveal this. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, as part of a visit that will also take him to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. “If we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world,” Blinken said. Reuters reported that Blinken said the US felt it was important to stand up to Russia because its aggression against Ukraine threatened the foundational principles of the international system. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. South Africa abstained from a United Nations vote denouncing the invasion of Ukraine, and like other African countries has resisted calls to condemn Russia. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has had harsh words on Telegram this afternoon following news that pro-Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia are moving towards holding a referendum to join the Russian Federation. Fedorov, who was forced into exile early in the war, writes: The collaborators decided to make another propaganda picture for the Russian mass media. They brought a crowd from other temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region to Melitopol – 700 people, because even that many cannot be recruited among the local population – and held a ‘forum’ in the city’s palace of culture. Yevhen Balytskyi, the Gauleiter of the Zaporizhzhia region, who at one time failed miserably in the local elections, gaining less than 10%, conducted the coven. It is difficult to guess what plans will appear in the head of this mentally ill local tsar and Kremlin henchman of tomorrow. In any case, his ‘orders’ have no legal significance. The RIA Novosti news agency reported earlier that Balytskyi signed the order for a referendum at a forum entitled “We are together with Russia”. It quotes Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the regional administration imposed by pro-Russian secessionists saying on the radio: We are preparing 100 percent. Everything is working out. We will have a voting format that is quite understandable to people. We will not conduct any experiments. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail on Monday after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multistorey apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Reuters reports the court in Chernihiv, north-east Ukraine, found Mikhail Kulikov, guilty of hitting the residential building on 26 February, two days after Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine began. Kulikov, who was capture while fighting, pleaded guilty and sought a more lenient punishment because he said he had been following orders, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. The residential block was not a military target or being used for military purposes, it said. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces deliberately target civilians. This is Martin Belam picking up the live blog again for an hour. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia is ready to facilitate a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Moscow’s permanent representative to the nuclear watchdog as saying on Monday. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in recent days, Reuters reported. Natalia Kompaniets spends her days running over a dilemma with her daughter as they sit in their temporary new home, a simply furnished room on the first floor of an unmarked building, in a nondescript suburb of Budapest. “Every day we think, should we go back or not? There’s a battle in our souls,” said Kompaniets, a 51-year-old who left the town of Obukhiv outside Kyiv in early March along with her daughter and young granddaughter. Here, as well as elsewhere in Hungary, Poland and other countries neighbouring Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees – mostly women, children and elderly people – are weighing up similar questions. If they are from a relatively safe part of Ukraine, is it time to return? Should they wait for the war to end? And how long would that mean waiting? Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling its Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, the Ukrainian ambassador to the global nuclear watchdog has said, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. “We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,” Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, the ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna. “We really need it urgently, as soon as possible, I would say not later than the end of this month,” he added. Ukraine has received its first three German Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The air defence systems, which are operated by three-person crews and can hit targets at up to two and half miles, are one of various pieces of western military kit being supplied to Ukraine to help it fend off the Russian invasion, Reuters reported. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia, the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Monday. It comes as Russia’s defence ministry said that Ukraine had shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe, on 7 August, damaging high-voltage power lines and forcing the plant to reduce its output. In its daily military briefing, the defence ministry said Ukraine had shelled the power station at around 12.40pm (9.40am GMT) from positions near the town of Marhanets, Reuters reported. The shelling damaged a high-voltage power line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions – parts of which are under Russian control – in southern Ukraine, the ministry said. A power surge also occurred as a result of the shelling, Moscow said, triggering a safety system that cut off the power supply, it added. German chancellor Olaf Scholz does not consider support for Russia sanctions to be waning even with energy bills expected to surge further, a government spokesperson said on Monday. “We face difficult months ahead,” the spokesperson said, adding: “But it is clear that we stand firmly on the side of Ukraine and we stand behind the sanctions that we agreed together with the European Union and the international community”. Speaking at a regular news conference in Berlin, the spokesperson also ruled out approval for the shelved Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces shot down 19 US-made Himars missiles across eastern and southern Ukraine, and destroyed Himars vehicles near the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk. Reuters was unable to verify the reports. More on this claim as it comes. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. In response to a question about Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan’s offers to broker peace talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy could meet only after negotiators from both sides had “done their homework”. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reported. “The Ukrainian delegation has gone off the radar, there is no negotiation process now,” Peskov said on Monday. “As for a meeting between presidents Putin and Zelenskiy, it is possible only after all the homework has been done by the delegations. This is missing, so there are no necessary prerequisites for the meeting,” he added. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax: “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called this morning for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Reuters reports he made the comments on television after Ukraine and Russia accused each of shelling the nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – which lies in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. At the same time, Energoatom has posted on its official Telegram channel accusing Russia of mining the plant. It claims to be quoting “the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence forces of the Russian Federation, major general Valeriy Vasyliev”, accusing him of saying: “We have planted mines in all the important facilities of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the plant will be either Russian – or no one’s.” AFP reports Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. “By 4 August, those fleeing Ukraine due to the Russian military attack had submitted 35,074 applications for temporary protection,” the Finnish immigration service said in a statement. More than 37,000 people are currently registered in the reception system, “which is more than ever before”. “One third of those fleeing Ukraine are children,” the immigration service said. The latest figures from UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. Reuters reports he told Interfax: “We have information from the military and representatives of Russia’s Rosatom, who are here, just watching the situation. We have information from them that everything is operating in normal mode.” Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight, Ukrainian officials have said. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” Reuters reports she said on television. The claims have not been independently verified, but earlier Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency that the Antonivskyi bridge had been struck again. Here is a selection of images that have been sent to us today over the newswires from Sloviansk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, appears to have confirmed on Telegram that at least one person has been killed in a strike this morning, posting “Unfortunately, as a result of the morning shelling, one person died, another one was injured. Information is being updated. Emergency medical personnel are on site.” In the last few minutes the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov has posted to Telegram to say: Now Pavlovo Pole is being shelled already in the morning … minutes ago there was an explosion. There is definitely no military infrastructure in this peaceful and densely populated area. I ask everyone to be in shelters – the shelling can be repeated. Here is an image that has been sent to us from Turkey of the ship Polarnet arriving at Derince port. It is carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that two people were killed in shelling on the region in the last 24 hours. He claimed that overnight the roof of the administrative building in Kharkiv’s Kyiv district had caught fire due to the shelling. His message ended: As you can see, the Russians, because of their lack of success at the front, are striking peaceful towns and villages in the region. But we are stronger than their pathetic attempts to intimidate us. Victory is ours! In the last few minutes he has issued a broad warning to citizens in Kharkiv, posting to Telegram to say: “Residents of Kharkiv and the region, stay in shelters as much as possible. The Russian occupiers strike Kharkiv. Do not leave safe places.” In his daily status update, Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has cautioned residents about the information sources they use, saying overnight rumours had been spread about a failure of the air alert system. He wrote on Telegram: On 8 August, at 2.57am, one of the Telegram channels spread information that there was an air alert in Lviv, but due to technical reasons, the city and phone applications did not turn on the notification. This information is not true! There was no threat. Follow and trust only official sources of information. The claim has not been independently verified. Elsewhere in his daily update, Kozytskyi said there had been one genuine air alert overnight, but that “the danger did not materialise”, and that 270 people arrived in his region on two evacuation trains from the east of the country. Seven hundred and 68 people departed from the Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on four trains. My colleague Shaun Walker recently wrote a lengthy profile of Dmitry Medvedev on the former Russian leader’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk. Medvedev has given an interview to Tass, which it has published this morning, which contains plenty of Medvedev’s anti-western rhetoric. The interview is timed to coincide with the anniversary of Russia’s assault on Georgia in 2008. which took place when he was in power. In today’s interview, Medvedev says: The criminal policy of the United States is being aggressively pursued in Ukraine. True, with much more active support from the European Union, which has finally lost its independence. The goal is the same – to destroy Russia. This is the root cause of the extremely aggressive, Russophobic geopolitical process initiated by the west. Our answer is tough, but carefully thought out. If there is an opportunity to resolve the problem peacefully, at the negotiating table, this should be done. But when there is no way out, you have to react by force. Unfortunately, both in Georgia and Ukraine, the authorities of these countries left Russia no choice, disrupting the processes of political settlement of these conflicts. And we deliberately went for military intervention. As far as Nato is concerned, its relentless desire to expand along Russia’s borders, like a cancerous tumour, has become a global problem. It makes all reasonable people sick. You can read the full Medvedev interview with Tass here. Read Shaun Walker’s profile of Medvedev here: ‘I hate them’: Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, an entity recognised as legitimate and official by only three UN member states, has issued a briefing for the day in which they say in the last 24 hours they have killed “up to 53 personnel” from Ukrainian forces, and destroyed four armoured personnel carriers and “seven units of special vehicles”. The announcement on Telegram also claims that as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces on the city of Alchevsk in occupied Luhansk, one civilian was killed and 19 people were injured, including five children. They claim that 13 apartment buildings, four kindergartens and a school were damaged. They claim that “peaceful life is being restored in the territories of the Luhansk People’s Republic liberated from Ukrainian nationalists” and cite more than five hectares being cleared of explosive devices. They also claim to be delivering humanitarian aid. None of the claims have been independently verified. A key Russian-held bridge into the occupied southern city of Kherson has been hit again overnight by Ukrainian forces, according to reports from the Russian-imposed administration there. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency: The blow was struck on the Antonivskiy bridge. The equipment of the builders who are repairing the bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted the bridge with high-precision weapons as it is one of only two permanent re-supply routes over the Dnieper River, linking the occupied city with the rest of Kherson region and down to annexed Crimea in the south. The claims have not been independently verified. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has posted to Telegram overnight about the situation in the occupied city, which he is in exile from. He told his supporters on Telegram: Today, high-precision Himars missiles fired at the points of temporary deployment of the occupying forces at industrial sites in various districts of the city of Melitopol. Last week, the occupiers redeployed a significant part of air defence from Melitopol to Kherson. Tonight is the most effective and shows that the existing enemy air defence units are no longer able to resist Himars. The weakening of the air defence system creates the necessary prerequisites for a successful counteroffensive in the direction of Melitopol. The claims have not been independently verified.

The Sacura, which departed from Yuzni, is carrying 11,000 tonnes of soybeans to Italy, while the Arizona, which left Chernomorsk, is carrying 48,458 tonnes of corn to Iskenderun in southern Turkey. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines, also known as “butterfly mines”, have the potential to inflict widespread casualties amongst both the military and the local civilian population. The ministry calls the PFM-1 mines “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons”, pointing to the devastating impact the mines had in the Soviet-Afghan war where they allegedly maimed a number of children who mistook them for toys. Battle for Donbas Russian forces are trying to gain full control of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region as it stepped up attacks north and north-west of Donetsk city on Sunday, Reuters reports The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, according to Ukraine’s military. In addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson. Hello, it’s Jordyn Beazley back with you on the Guardian’s live blog as we cover all the latest developments from Ukraine. UN secretary general António Guterres has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Here’s a summary of the main points you might have missed: Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T12:44:34Z","webTitle":"How dangerous is the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN has called for international inspectors to be given access to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, after it was shelled at the weekend. But how dangerous is the situation and what is likely to happen next? Why is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant important? The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes. Situated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, south-west of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war. The presence of the water-cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called “sheltered” artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield” saying: “Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.” That has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks. Why is there renewed concern? There are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict. A second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility. According to Energoatom – the Ukrainian nuclear authority – the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site. However, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia – so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend’s incident was in and of itself. While Ukraine’s objective – to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area – is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity. A final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence – reported in Ukrainian media outlets – that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: “There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.” However, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between “nuclear blackmail” and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself. So how dangerous is shelling around the plant? The reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact – think of a civilian airliner crashing into them – protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic. The buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited. The reality is that the situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-02T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Blazin’ Squad look back: ‘We needed chaperones – it wasn’t great for our credibility’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","fields":{"bodyText":"The 10 original members of Blazin’ Squad met at school in Chingford, north-east London. Known for their fusion of pop, R&amp;B and rap, they had their first hit in 2002 with a cover of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony’s Crossroads. A further six Top 10 singles followed, as well as two gold records and a sold-out arena tour. The crew’s current lineup is Spike E (Sam Foulkes), Rocky B (Marcel Somerville), Freek (Ollie Georgiou) and Melo D (Chris McKeckney). They play Reminisce festival on 9 September. Sam (new image, sitting) The boys used to take the mick back then, as I had a baby face. Looking at this image from Smash Hits, they were right: my face is so swollen, it’s like I’ve been stung by a bee. I couldn’t grow facial hair until I was 19. Thankfully, my head has slimmed down by 300%. My hairline’s gone back a fair bit, too. None of us were proactively trying to get famous. Everything just aligned: when we were 15, a guy at school was doing work experience at a studio. He knew we’d done garage and MC’d at parties, so he said we could record a demo for £200. After that, he asked us to come back again, but this time we could do it for free. A few weeks later, he called to say some A&amp;Rs from East West Records wanted to meet us. When we got there they said: “Can you MC in front of us, right now?” It was terrifying! A week later, we were in Kensington with lawyers, having dinner and signing contracts. Two weeks later we were performing in South Africa, and a week after that we had our first No 1. But one minute we were selling out Wembley, the next our phones stopped ringing and we had to find new ways to make money. We could have let the end of the group eat us up, but we didn’t. We cracked on, and I’m always in the mindset that if Blazin’ Squad stopped tomorrow, I’d be gutted but OK. Marcel (on left) Me and Melo were always at the back of photos as everyone else was shorter than us. That’s why I’m crouching in such a random pose; it’s what I had to do to get into the shot. We were promoting our second album at the time. The entire Blazin’ Squad experience was epic, but we were making our best music at this point: Flip Reverse, Here 4 One, We Just Be Dreamin’ – it was good times. Crossroads going to No 1 was crazy, but the music on that first album wasn’t necessarily us and there was a lot of input from the label. On the second record, we got a bit more control. We were living that pop star lifestyle, too – out in the West End, VIP treatment. Not something we ever imagined as a bunch of teenagers from Chingford. We carried on making a third album even though we didn’t have a deal, but when we played it to our managers they didn’t see our vision – they had ideas about how we could be more mainstream. We were ready to embrace the digital age and self-release but they were more hesitant. In the end, the group naturally faded out – people got jobs and moved on. In 2009, the four of us started to do some small gigs, then in 2017, after I got made redundant from my job, I decided to sign up for Love Island. After going on the show, Blazin’ Squad blew up again: we got booked for all the festivals. Our Spotify streams increased by 3,000%. The 10 of us have remained friends now for 20 years, but while it would be incredible to get the original lineup on stage, I don’t think it’s going to happen. Everyone’s off doing their own thing: Kenzie is a superstar DJ, MoJam [Mustafa Omer and James Murray] have written loads of successful songs. I might be the most famous member now, though, which is great, because I used to be in the background. The world turns, things change, and these days there’s room for everyone at the front. Ollie (on right) I’ve no memory of this shoot, but I’m grateful I didn’t get ripped off as bad as Sam did with those bootcut jeans. Even if he got to keep the Timberlands. Things moved fast for Blazin’ Squad. In our first year, we went 323 days without a day off. The 4am call times for early morning TV shows were a bit hard to manage as we had to be bubbly, but apart from that it was amazing. One of my highlights was getting asked by Kool and the Gang to cover their song Joanna. We got to meet them, too, but my hair was atrocious that day. I have incredibly curly hair and all I ever wanted was for it to be straight, so I got it done and I ended up looking like I had a lion’s mane. As we were so young at the start, we needed chaperones until we were 16, which was not great for credibility, especially if we were meeting new people: “Hi, yeah, nice to meet you. Here’s my dad. He has to come with me everywhere I go.” We couldn’t get up to all the things teenagers get up to without getting into a lot of shit. But by album No 2 we could, and we did. Groups like So Solid Crew, Busted, Sugababes and Girls Aloud really put their arms around us. We were like their little brothers. We had beef with David Sneddon for a bit – for some reason the acts from Fame Academy were not our greatest fans. But as there were so many of us in the group it was hard to branch out and make new friends. It was probably quite intimidating for people to come over to talk to us. We weren’t rude, we just kept to ourselves. It was a bit daunting when the group ended. I was a bit embarrassed, thinking: “Oh God, what will people think of me? Am I just a failed pop star?” To a degree, that was accurate, but realistically the fame was never going to last for ever. The best thing is that we are still all good mates, and all of these experiences make our bond pretty strong. Chris (in phone box) That’s me behind two band members in the phone box. Me and Marcel got pushed to the back because we were the tallest. That’s the reason I was told, anyway. My favourite memories are of the first day of tour: we’d wait outside a Chingford pub with our parents and the bus would arrive. We were energetic teenage boys and we’d pile in and drive off, waving to our parents from the windows. That’s when the fun would really start. There was always a lot of joking around, so we never got time to be nervous. We’d just done our GCSEs and nobody had cared about us at school. Suddenly we were on stage with thousands of fans screaming our names. There was no chance anyone would get too big for their boots, though: you’d immediately get slapped back down by the rest of the group. We’ve all got our jobs and families now, so when we do shows we appreciate it more because it’s an escape from normality. My baby son came to see his first Blazin’ Squad show on Father’s Day. When we did Crossroads, each of us brought our kids on stage. That was a nice moment. The Blazin’ Squad junior crew! Maybe they’ll take over: they’ve already outnumbered us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T14:11:39Z","webTitle":"Chinese congress expected to cement power of Xi Jinping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","fields":{"bodyText":"The highest level meeting of China’s ruling Communist party this week is likely to include constitutional changes to further cement the power of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, party officials have confirmed. Xi is expected to regain his position as leader of the CCP and its military commission at the week-long conference, setting the stage for retaining the presidency next year, after abolishing term limits in 2018. The 20th party congress will begin on Sunday morning with a major speech by Xi, espousing the party’s achievements over the past five-year term, and outlining its plans for the next. Days of closed-door meetings and the formalisation of official reshuffles will follow, before the members of the all-powerful politburo standing committee are revealed next weekend. At a press conference in Beijing, the party spokesperson Sun Yeli told reporters revisions of the party’s governing constitution were on the agenda. Sun did not provide specifics but said amendments were necessary to enshrine new “major theoretical views and major strategic ideas” introduced during the congress. Amendments are widely expected to enshrine the “two establishes”, a party political term for new doctrines cementing Xi as the “core” of the CCP and his ideas as the party’s underpinning ideology. Sun said it had been common practice for the party to make amendments to its constitution to “recognise innovations in theory and revolutions in practice”. During a pre-vetted Q&amp;A session, Sun also indicated China’s increasingly contentious Covid policy of “dynamic zero” was to remain for now. He said as much as the world yearned for the pandemic to end, the reality was the virus still existed, and China’s government would continue to “put people and people’s lives front and centre” in its response. The dynamic zero covid policy – which has resulted in sudden lockdowns and movement restrictions being imposed on buildings, neighbourhoods, or entire cities – was “a science-based approach … with minimum costs for the society and in the shortest possible time”. He said this policy had “worked the best for our country”. In the press conference, one of the few public events of the congress, Sun sidestepped questions about China’s economic troubles and whether the era of “high-speed growth” had come to an end. He said it was “an important yardstick but not the only one”; China had entered a new era, away from high-speed growth and towards high-quality development. On US relations, Sun appeared to take a somewhat conciliatory tone. The two countries’ relationship has plummeted in recent years, with trade wars, diplomatic spats and the imposition of sanctions, as well as hostilities over China’s human rights abuses and crackdowns on Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and its growing aggression in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Sun said: “We take the view that China and the US have more common interests than differences. We don’t provoke, nor do we flinch from facing up to trouble.” However, he said “no one can hold back the historic force of China’s national rejuvenation”, a reference to Xi’s commitment to annexing Taiwan – a democracy which the CCP claims is a Chinese province and has sworn to “unify”. The CCP has repeatedly said it will use force to take Taiwan if necessary, most recently in a white paper released last month. Sun said force was a last resort to be taken “under compelling circumstances” and that peaceful unification was the CCP’s “first choice”. “We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and effort, and create vast space for peaceful reunification,” he said. “We don’t renounce the use of force … This is to guard against external interference and a small handful of Taiwan independence elements and their separatist moves. By no means does this target our fellow Chinese in Taiwan.” Senior Chinese officials have recently increased their rhetoric over Taiwan, warning of “re-education” of citizens post-invasion, and punishment for independence advocates. Consistent opinion polling in Taiwan shows a growing majority reject the prospect of Chinese rule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","fields":{"bodyText":"The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T00:10:44Z","webTitle":"Russia suspends US inspections of its nuclear weapons arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a new blow to arms control.

It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. “There are no similar obstacles to the arrival of American inspectors in Russia,” the statement said. “The Russian foreign ministry raised this issue with the relevant countries, but did not receive an answer.” The US state department did not immediately respond to the claim that the sanctions created an imbalance when it came to nuclear weapons inspections. A spokesperson said: “The United States is committed to implementation of the New Start Treaty, but we keep discussions between the parties concerning treaty implementation confidential.” The treaty, which limits each country’s deployed strategic warheads to 1,550, and imposes limits on delivery systems, was extended for five years in February 2021. It is the last remaining arms control treaty in effect between the US and Russia, and its inspection and verification clauses are widely seen as vital in building mutual confidence and preventing nuclear miscalculation. “At a time when US and Russian relations are tense, anything that undermines stability and nuclear predictability is a concern,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was senior director for arms control and nonproliferation in the Obama administration’s national security council. “However, we continue to exchange large volumes of information with Russia about their nuclear weapons. The hope is that this is just a political road bump and not a major new obstacle to stability.” While inspections have stalled, Russian nuclear forces have maintained another key part of the New Start agreement, notifications to the US on any movements or changes in status of its nuclear arsenal. “They’ve been stepping up notifications. It’s remarkable,” Rose Gottemoeller, former Nato deputy secretary general and under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said. “Notifications come in to something called the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Centre, which is a centre headquartered in the department of state. They told me one day in May they got 18 notifications. They’ve never seen that number of notifications before,” Gottemoeller, now a lecturer at Stanford University, added. “So it seems like the Russians, at least the Russian nuclear forces, have been intent on trying to continue implementation for mutual predictability and confidence.” Inspections are important way of checking whether a country’s notifications on its nuclear weapons are accurate, but Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based independent analyst on Russian nuclear forces, said they are not the only one. “First, the volume of notifications is sufficiently large so you should be able to detect serious discrepancies,” Podvig, who is also a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said. “Then, there are always national technical means – they cannot see everything, of course, but serious discrepancies will be detected … So, I wouldn’t say that all is lost for arms control, even though, of course, it’s a rather unfortunate decision on Russia’s part.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T14:16:29Z","webTitle":"Conservatives will not devolve more powers to Scotland, Rishi Sunak says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. “Scotland already is the most powerful devolved assembly anywhere in the world,” he said during a question-and-answer session chaired by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. “The SNP and the Scottish government doesn’t even use the powers they already have, so we shouldn’t start talking about any more. What we need to do is hold them to account.” His remarks suggest there will be an intense contest between Labour and the Conservatives over Scotland’s powers at the next general election, which could further divide the anti-independence vote in Scotland. Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, has committed his party to sweeping changes in Britain’s political structures, including abolishing the House of Lords, and as-yet-unspecified new powers for Holyrood. He also supports Holyrood’s higher taxes for higher earners – a policy the Tories oppose. As well as reform-minded unionists, Labour hopes to attract pro-independence voters who may see enhanced devolution as a compromise solution now that the prospects of a second independence referendum have greatly subsided after Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation, the SNP’s ill-tempered succession battle and the crisis with the police investigation into SNP finances. In his conference speech later on Friday, Ross abandoned a previous proposal that Tory voters in SNP-Labour and SNP-Liberal Democrat marginals should consider voting tactically by backing the best-placed unionist party instead of automatically voting Tory. That proposal, which Ross made in an interview with the Daily Telegraph this month, was quickly shot down by No 10. Sunak’s remarks and his short speech earlier to delegates were overshadowed by a heated row involving No 10 officials and Scottish political journalists after Downing Street tried to restrict access to a briefing with Sunak to six handpicked newspapers. A large group of reporters, who were accredited to cover the conference and were also members of the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists’ Association, sidestepped party officials and entered the briefing room, followed by television crews. The dispute follows a previous clash between Westminster lobby correspondents and No 10 officials who tried to restrict access to briefings with Boris Johnson to handpicked media outlets. After a protracted and at times fractious standoff in Glasgow, during which No 10 insisted that reporters and TV crews who had not been invited had to leave, and then threatened to cancel the briefing, it took place an hour late with every newspaper reporter present. In his conference-floor appearance, Sunak also said the UK government had the right to sidestep the Scottish parliament by directly funding initiatives at local level in policy areas devolved to Holyrood, as part of its levelling up agenda. The Tories argue that Scotland has two governments – at Holyrood and at Westminster – and that was “really healthy”, Sunak said, adding that it was well-received by Scottish councils and local communities. “We know that in the same way that Westminster doesn’t always know best, it’s not the case that in Scotland the SNP and the Holyrood government always know best,” he said. “We don’t have to just hand everything over to the Scottish government. I think that’s real devolution, or devolution in action at a very local level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"Power Failure by William D Cohan review – pulling the plug","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","fields":{"bodyText":"The executive suite of General Electric’s Connecticut headquarters was known as “carpet land”. Persian rugs and dense wool carpet covered every floor, creating an atmosphere of hushed probity. For almost a century, GE had stamped its curling blue logo on just about everything, from wind turbines to submarine detectors, fridges, televisions, toasters and lightbulbs. The office was a monument to the baronial power of its CEO. Jeff Immelt, the final chief to occupy this floor, enjoyed the use of a shoeshine station, a pantry and dining room. His two assistants also had their own private bathroom. When Immelt travelled by private jet, as he often did, a second, empty jet would often trail behind him in case of mechanical failures on the first plane. At its peak, GE was an industrial empire worth almost $600bn. When Immelt became CEO in 2001, he inherited one of the most valuable companies in the world. It was so trustworthy that it had a triple-A credit score, the same rating given to government debt. Fast forward two decades and that huge company is about to disappear. In November 2021, General Electric announced it would be broken up into smaller fragments. Over the previous few years its number of employees had fallen by more than half. The founder of GE, Thomas Edison, was credited with inventing the lightbulb. By the 2000s, the company had started sourcing its lightbulbs from Chinese contractors and branding them as GE products. In 2020, GE sold off its lighting business for good. William D Cohan’s new book, Power Failure, is a digressive history of what went wrong behind closed doors. Cohan, a business writer and former investment banker, covers almost a century of imperial expansion and errors of judgment. He focuses on the insular politics of the boardroom and the machinations of its executives, rarely pausing to consider the transformation that GE’s products or corporate culture wreaked on the wider world. Instead, Power Failure hinges on two antagonists: the late Jack Welch, the heedless, tyrannical chief executive who was said to advocate firing 10% of his workforce every year, and his successor Immelt, an obstinate sales manager who, as one of Cohan’s sources puts it, was merely “masquerading as a CEO”. Welch, the restless only son of working-class Irish-American parents, became CEO of GE a few months after Ronald Reagan became president. He was a qualified chemist, but his fortunes rose when he learned the art of financial engineering. Welch transformed GE Credit, a programme launched at the height of the Great Depression that allowed customers to buy appliances and pay for them later, into a financial powerhouse. Under his leadership, the company used its stellar credit rating to borrow cheaply in unsecured markets and lend this money to borrowers at higher interest rates, pocketing the difference. Welch often remarked how effortless it was: “I thought it was easier than bending metal,” he told Cohan, who worked for GE’s financial arm for two years when he was still in his 20s. “It was a home run.” He turned GE into a company that made money from money. Welch displayed a zealous concern for earnings targets (the Financial Times once called him the “number whisperer”). Often, he would reduce overheads by simply firing people (he fired more than 100,000 staff in his first few years as CEO), or by outsourcing GE’s work to other companies in countries with lower labour costs. But there was another, more contentious source of his uncanny ability to produce ever-increasing growth. The Wall Street Journal accused GE of engaging in “earnings management”, the practice of smoothing out gains and losses in order to produce the illusion of steadily rising profits on a balance sheet (accusations that Welch vehemently denied). In any case, he had created a company whose value was like a skyscraper built on sand, prone to crumbing as soon as the landscape beneath it shifted. Soon, the profits from GE Capital far outstripped those made from inventing things, or producing X-ray machines and jet propulsion engines. Immelt tried to stem the company’s reliance on financial speculation, but he ended up by inviting the enemy in. In 2015, Trian Partners, an asset management firm known for shaking up underperforming companies, became a top investor. Billionaire co-founder Nelson Peltz, who voted for Trump in 2016, was relentless in his pursuit of shareholder value, so it was perhaps inevitable that the firm would demand changes – including Immelt’s head. GE now has a new CEO, Larry Culp, who works closely with Peltz (neither spoke with Cohan for the book). Last year, Culp finally “pulled the plug on the company”. At more than 700 pages, Power Failure asks a lot of its reader. Halfway through, a blurry feeling settled over me as the narrative thread was unwound by detours about where particular executives went to university or whom they married. Cohan quotes at length from interviews with Welch, whose anecdotes feel a little too neat, as if you’re listening to a faded power broker recount their best stories across a bar. The rise and fall of GE is explained as the product of individual men and their mercurial decisions, yet its fate has a wider significance. It ought to be a warning: cost-cutting, outsourcing and financial speculation produce a warped model of value that is liable to collapse. • Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon by William D Cohan is published by Penguin (£35).

The joint view comes as EU foreign affairs ministers slapped human rights sanctions on the Iranian morality police over their handling of street protests and treatment of women. The drone strikes continued in Ukraine on Monday, killing three more people, according to the mayor of Kyiv. Despite the French-British belief that Iran is breaching the UN security council resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal by supplying the drones, there is no immediate plan to refer the issue to the UN, but diplomatic sources said the issue was live. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Iran’s supply of drones to Russia constituted a breach of UN security council resolution 2231, which was unanimously adopted six days after the nuclear deal was signed in Vienna, and called on UN member states to refrain “from actions that undermine implementation of commitments”. “The UK has condemned Iran’s decision to supply drones and training to Russia. Iran supplying drones is inconsistent with UN security council resolution 2231 and is further evidence of the role Iran plays in undermining global security,” the spokesperson said. “The UK will continue to work with our partners to hold Iran to account for its destabilising behaviour around the world.” The French foreign ministry spokesperson last week revealed Paris had noted “a great deal of information that reports the use of Iranian drones by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, in bombardments that were aimed at civilian targets”. Although a ban on Iranian arms exports expired in 2020, the nuclear deal signed in 2015, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), retains a ban on any activity related to ballistic missiles until 2023. France and the UK say Iran, in supplying drones, is in breach of obligations under parts of the JCPoA and the missile technology control regime that limits the proliferation of missiles. The west has the ability to “snapback” on some sanctions if it asserts Iran is breaching the JCPoA. More practically it is inconceivable that the west will resume negotiations about renewing the nuclear deal so long as there is clear evidence that Iran is supplying arms to help Russia defeat Ukraine. The talks are effectively on hold until after the US midterm elections, even though Iran is continuing to expand its use of more sophisticated centrifuges. The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Naser Kanani, in his weekly press conference again denied Iran was supplying drones to Russia, challenging claims by the US, Ukraine and many arms specialists that Iranian-manufactured Shahed-136 drones were in clear use. He said: “Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Iran has not exported any weapons to any of the warring parties. As we have said many times, Iran’s foreign policy is based on opposing war, and regarding the war in Ukraine, we are also against war, and we are trying to end the military approach in this field.” The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has in the recent past spoken of a new military pact with Russia, but not referred to a specific deal on drone exports. Iranian journalists have repeatedly challenged the foreign ministry about its denials. The US warned on Monday that it would take action against companies and nations working with Iran’s drone program, describing the deepening alliance between Moscow and Tehran as “a profound threat”. “Anyone doing business with Iran that could have any link to UAVs or ballistic missile developments or the flow of arms from Iran to Russia should be very careful and do their due diligence – the US will not hesitate to use sanctions or take actions against perpetrators,” said a State Department spokesperson. Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv military administration, said last week that explosions at a military base 75km south of the city, wounding one, had been carried out by these drones. The highly effective “kamikaze” drones have been used with great effect, and are seen as a cheap alternative to missiles. EU foreign ministers imposed sanctions on 11 Iranian security officers and four entities including the morality police on Monday in response to the crackdown on protests triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurd. The EU list goes further than the recently announced British and US sanctions, but still stops short of the systematic attack on Iranian regime supporters and family members in Europe that is being sought by some Iranians. In common with Washington, the EU sanctioned Iran’s morality police and two of its key figures, Mohammad Rostami and Haj Ahmad Mirzaei. In addition, the EU designates the Iranian Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), as well as a number of its local chiefs, for their role in the repression of the protests. The EU also listed Issa Zarepour, the Iranian minister of information and communications technology, for his responsibility over the internet shutdown. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps cyber-defence command was also the subject of sanctions. Anoosheh Ashoori, one of the former British-Iranian dual nationals released from Evin prison after nearly five years in detention, said the west needed to go much further in enforcing sanctions. “There is no point imposing sanctions only on the morality police that are not going to come to Europe. But there are a large number of children and relatives of the regime that, like the Russian oligarchs, like living the high life here and have assets here. “Britain cannot have dealings with a regime that kills children and detains people for the amount of hair they show. This regime is brutal and has no red lines. Britain will be asked when this regime falls whether it was on the right side of history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T16:55:46Z","webTitle":"Net zero strategy shows UK will miss 2030 emissions cuts target ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government has said it is still on track to meet its international climate commitments under the Paris agreement, as analysis of its energy plans suggested more drastic policies would be needed to make the required carbon cuts. Ministers announced the UK’s revamped net zero strategy on Thursday, with a raft of documents exceeding 1,000 pages, setting out policies on sectors from biomass to solar power, and from electric vehicles to nuclear reactors. It came as Rishi Sunak headed to Oxfordshire to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, accompanied by Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary. The prime minister said: “People should be really proud of the UK’s track record on all of this. If you look at it, we’ve decarbonised faster than any other major economy. Our carbon emissions have been reduced by over 40%, much more than all the other countries that we compete with.” Shapps later told Sky News: “We all know that electricity can be a big way to decarbonise, but we also know these are big changes. So this is not a sort of rip-out-your-boiler moment. This is a transition over a period of time to get to homes which are heated in a different way and also insulated much better.” The government’s analysis, however, shows that its new policies will meet only 92% of the emissions cuts required and, without further changes, the target will be missed. At the heart of its strategy is the UK’s legally binding requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and its commitment under the Paris agreement to a plan – called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – to cut emissions by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The 2030 pledge, boasted of as “world-leading” in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, is vital to get the UK on track to meet the long-term goal, and will be closely scrutinised by other governments. Within the dense pages of analysis and recommendations, the official assessment of the NDC stood out: “We have quantified emissions savings to deliver 88 megatonnes or 92% of the NDC. We are confident that the delivery of emissions savings by unquantified policies detailed in this package will largely close this gap and the government will bring forward further measures to ensure [it] will meet its international commitments if required.” However, Chris Venables, the head of politics at Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Our analysis shows that even that 92% is a very generous reading. It is hard to celebrate an announcement that says itself it’s not enough. The bottom line is that this plan doesn’t plot a route to net zero. There are only so many times we can claim climate leadership while falling short of our own targets.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told MPs: “A target for less than seven years’ time, and they [the government] are miles off … all of the policies, all of the hot air, don’t meet the target they promised on the world stage.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the Guardian: “We remain committed to delivering our international commitments, including the 2030 NDC under the Paris agreement which we fully expect to meet. We are on track to deliver our carbon budgets, creating jobs and investment across the UK while reducing emissions. Our carbon budget delivery plan is a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 15 years, setting us on course to reach net zero by 2050.” A few of the winners … Electric vehicles Car manufacturers must ensure a proportion of their sales are of electric vehicles – 22% of cars and 10% of vans by 2024 – under a zero emissions vehicle mandate, though campaigners said the proportion had been set too low. About £800m in capital funding is being made available for electric vehicles, and there will be a boost to EV charging infrastructure. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Much of the government’s strategy for continuing with fossil fuel development – with decisions on potential new oil and gas fields imminent – rests on the deployment of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological formations under the North Sea. The government shortlisted eight projects to move ahead in its funding scheme, including one backed by oil giant BP, and expects to make £20bn of investment available over 20 years in CCS. Hydrogen and nuclear The government named 20 new hydrogen projects that are on track to receive a share of £240m, to help the development of a fuel the government sees as central to the UK’s low-carbon future. It comes despite doubts among experts over some of its applications – particularly in home heating – and some of its sources, as fossil fuel companies are looking to hydrogen to allow them to continue drilling. Great British Nuclear will be a new organisation intended to come forward with small nuclear projects that the government believes will be key to its aim of generating a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear by 2050. And some of the gaps and the losers … Onshore wind The government dashed hopes that its new strategy might lift the ban on onshore windfarms in England. The lack of action has frustrated leading academics and green groups because onshore windfarms could begin powering the grid far sooner than nuclear reactors, and would help to reduce energy bills. Dr Daniel Quiggin, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said onshore wind could bring greater real emissions reductions than removing emissions from the air via carbon capture technology. Grid connections While the government hopes to boost renewable power generation, and nuclear energy, there was little detail on how to solve one of the most pressing problems for the UK’s ageing electricity network. New windfarms and other sources of power, and the battery storage facilities needed to smooth out the intermittency of renewable power, can wait years for the grid connections they need, partly owing to the difficulty of getting planning permission and partly to a lack of grid capacity. Andy Willis, the founder of Kona Energy, said: “Without significant grid connection reform, the vast potential of clean energy development will linger, trapped behind red tape and bureaucratic delays.” Farming There was little reference to agriculture, even though farming and food prices are highly sensitive to energy costs and agriculture is one of the biggest single sources of UK emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was involved in the Whitehall discussions around Thursday’s announcements, but a key land use strategy is not due until the end of June. Then, both the future of farming emissions and the potential for growing trees and restoring landscapes to store carbon – and offset the UK’s remaining emissions by 2050 – will be addressed. Biomass There was drama on the stock market on Thursday as shares in Drax, which operates the UK’s biggest power station burning biomass, fell early on after the government appeared to reject its plea for increased subsidies for a project to capture and store the carbon dioxide from its wood burning. But Drax quickly pointed out that the main decisions on subsidies will follow later, by the end of June, when a biomass strategy is promised. The market confusion arose, the company claimed, because the government had separated its process for supporting hydrogen, gas and CCS projects from its consideration of biomass subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-31T17:49:58Z","webTitle":"Electricity firms face penalties for ‘manipulating’ grid in Ofgem crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"Electricity companies will no longer be able to deploy a controversial tactic that forces up bills at the expense of consumers, the energy watchdog has said as it unveiled rules designed to curb firms making “excessive” profits in the winter. Ofgem said electricity generators could face “stiff penalties” of up to 10% of their revenue for breaching the new regulations, which aim to prevent manipulation of the complex system that keeps Britain’s electricity grid stable. The “balancing mechanism” is the main tool used by the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO) to plug gaps between supply and demand on the network. It allows the ESO to do deals with generators at short notice to ensure the right amount of electricity supply to maintain relative equilibrium on the grid, preventing imbalances that can cause problems such as power outages. Under the balancing mechanism electricity generators get paid varying rates for turning their output up or down, on a minute-by-minute basis. The cost of this system is ultimately borne by bill payers via “network costs” included on bills. Ofgem said it had acted on concerns that some generators were “taking advantage” of the balancing mechanism, at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds to households already struggling with sky-high energy costs. The watchdog said that in previous winters some electricity generators had deliberately stopped generating power early in the afternoon, meaning plants were switched off during the crucial evening spike in demand. They would then offer to resume generating power later in the day, cashing in on the greatly increased prices on offer via the balancing mechanism. Annual balancing costs tripled in the winter of 2021-22, as power prices surged to record highs, rising to £1.5bn compared with an average of £500m in the previous three years, Ofgem said. Daily balancing costs hit a record of £60m on a single Wednesday, 24 November 2021, while the total annual balancing cost paid for by consumers reached £3.1bn during that financial year. Ofgem’s measures affect the companies that generate electricity at power plants, rather than the suppliers that charge households directly. However, the costs of the balancing mechanism are ultimately passed on to consumers through their bills. According to an investigation by Bloomberg this year, the companies that benefited from inflated electricity prices include SSE, the German state-owned power firm Uniper, and VPI, which is owned by the commodities trading firm Vitol. Ofgem said the new Inflexible Offers Licence Condition (IOLC), which comes into effect on 26 October, would ban this practice and would apply to any generators that switched off their plant for more than an hour. Firms can be fined up to 10% of their revenues and forced to make redress to consumers under Ofgem’s existing licence conditions. Eleanor Warburton, the regulator’s acting director for energy systems management and security, said: “These new licence conditions show Ofgem will not tolerate electricity generators attempting to take advantage of the balancing mechanism system to make excessive profits through inflexible generation. “We believe the new licence condition strikes the right balance between protecting consumers and ensuring they pay a fair price for their energy while also enabling a competitive electricity market that provides fair returns for generators. We’ll be monitoring the effectiveness of it to ensure it’s doing what it was designed to do.” The actions Ofgem’s new rules are designed to prevent were not in breach of electricity generators’ licence conditions at the time they took place. The trade body Energy UK, which represents energy firms including electricity generators, said: “Balancing costs are ultimately paid by customers so it’s right that Ofgem looks at ways to reduce these costs through this measure and other changes to the balancing mechanism. “The best way to reduce balancing costs over the long term will be through enabling a more competitive and transparent market and an approach to balancing that capitalises on the increasing amounts of low-carbon flexible assets across the UK, from energy storage to demand-side response.” A spokesperson for the power company VPI said it was a “responsible participant” in the UK power market and would continue to abide by all relevant regulations. VPI was investing £500m to increase power generation capacity, it said. A spokesperson for SSE said: “As a responsible operator SSE fully complies with all relevant rules and regulations.” The Guardian has approached Uniper for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T18:11:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are, broadly speaking, ready.

The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Reports were emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T17:27:07Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on China and Ukraine: beware great expectations | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","fields":{"bodyText":"Straddles are, by their nature, uncomfortable positions to maintain. So it isn’t surprising that China’s attempt to hold together conflicting interests on the war in Ukraine – maintaining its “no limits” partnership with Russia, without damaging its relationship with western nations and its tarnished global brand too greatly – has proved awkward. Attention increased when its special envoy for Eurasian affairs, Li Hui, joined talks in Jeddah last weekend, having avoided similar talks in Copenhagen earlier this summer. European officials described China’s involvement as “active” and said that it “appeared constructive”. The verb may be as important as the adjective: China is manoeuvring around the conflict, not fundamentally repositioning itself. Xi Jinping finally held a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in April – but only after a senior diplomat caused outrage by questioning the sovereignty of former Soviet republics. The Jeddah talks were immediately followed by reassurance to Moscow that nothing had changed. Many in China view the invasion not in moral terms, but more cynically, especially given their suspicion of the US and, by extension, Nato. But the conflict has usefully diverted US energy from tackling the tense bilateral relationship. It has made Moscow more reliant on Beijing – and more clearly subordinate. China also perceives that Russia is not looking for a swift exit, but bedding itself in for a long war, not least because a second term for Donald Trump would dramatically improve its position, and Ukraine’s counteroffensive is not making the headway that many hoped for. That allows Beijing to monitor both a modern war and western responses to it – information that would be helpful were it to move against Taiwan. The head of MI6, Richard Moore, said last month that Beijing was “absolutely complicit” on Ukraine, supporting Moscow diplomatically and pushing Russian talking points. China has not criticised the invasion – or even acknowledged it as such – but attacks “unilateral sanctions”. It has thrown Russia an economic lifeline. Chinese firms are providing equipment that is useful to the military as well as civilians, such as body armour and drones. But China has not supplied arms and does not want the conflict to escalate, or to spill over into the broader region. Nor does it want to see further consolidation of the west, for both security and economic reasons. It knows that its partnership with Russia has hardened European attitudes towards it. The Wagner mutiny will also have given it pause for thought. And it wants to be regarded, especially by representatives of the global south such as those present in Jeddah, as a peacemaker standing above the fray. Its expressions of concern about the use of nuclear weapons look like hints to the west as well as warnings to Moscow: don’t push Vladimir Putin too far. Nonetheless, if they have any effect in restraining Russia, that can only be welcome. China, the biggest importer of Ukrainian grain, also has entirely pragmatic reasons for encouraging Russia to return to the Black Sea grain deal. It has highlighted the need to address the safety of nuclear power plants. And some hope it could play a useful, if marginal, role in negotiations eventually. The most important question, however, may still be what it does not do: whether it holds back from increasing support for Russia. That is why Kyiv is stepping carefully itself, as it seeks to avoid antagonising Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"‘Bristol is ready to give us power’: Greens hopeful of win in pivotal byelection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","fields":{"bodyText":"The issues that have been raised on the doorstep during the campaign have tended to be local ones – from concerns over new housing developments to the state of the pavements and plans to increase fees paid by people who live on boats in the harbour. But a council byelection taking place at Bristol city council on Thursday may have national implications should the Green party manage to pinch the ward from the Lib Dems. If the Greens do win – and they lost last time to the Lib Dems by only 26 votes – they would become the biggest party on Bristol city council, which they say would be a significant shift and one they believe would put them in pole position to eventually win power at city hall and a parliamentary seat at the next general election. “It does feel like an important moment,” said Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the Green party in England and Wales and herself a Bristol city councillor, speaking while out on the campaign trail in the ward, Hotwells and Harbourside. “For a start, it would be part of the trend of the Greens making gains here. The Greens are already the joint biggest group on Bristol city council with 24 councillors, the same as Labour. We know there’s a massive appetite for Green politics in Bristol.” Bristol is traditionally thought of as a Labour city but the Greens drew level, at least as far as the number of councillors was concerned, in May 2021. It means they already have more councillors in Bristol than in any other local authority. However, it did not lead to access to the levers of power as Bristol has a Labour directly elected mayor, Marvin Rees, and he resisted calls for Greens to be given cabinet posts. “He could have chosen to have a cross-party cabinet – he opted to have a 100% Labour cabinet,” said Denyer. She does not expect much to change immediately if the Greens win on Thursday. “I’m not holding my breath that he will hand over the keys of the city.” But major changes are afoot with the city voting last year to scrap the mayoral role, returning to a committee system from 2024. How this will work is being hammered out but a win at this byelection, followed by strong showings at the next council elections in May 2024, will help the Green cause. “I do think the direction of travel demonstrated by Green results in the last few elections shows Bristol is ready to give Greens power,” said Denyer. “There’s a change of the guard in the air.” Denyer is also the Green’s MP candidate for Bristol West. In the 2019 general election she came second, nearly doubling the Greens’ previous vote share. Of the 20 councillors in Bristol West, 16 are Greens and winning in Hotwells and Harbourside would make it 17. “It would a boost to our chances of winning the Bristol West seat,” said Denyer. She was out with the candidate for Hotwells and Harbourside, Patrick McAllister, who works locally in legal services, trying to persuade a few last “undecideds” that Green was the way to go. McAllister said he was determined to secure a fairer, greener future for his ward and the city. “People talk about those local issues – the housing developments, the boat charges and so on, but also about things like council tax going up and how they afford it at a time of a cost of living crisis.” The campaign has not been without controversies. The scandal of flammable cladding affects many residents in the ward, including the Labour candidate, Eileen Means, who has said resolving the issue will be her top priority. The Lib Dem’s Hotwells candidate, Stephen Williams, a former UK government junior minister in the Cameron-Clegg coalition, has accused the Greens of trying to “smear” him during the campaign by suggesting he could have done more to address fire safety issues when he was in power. “It shows how desperate they are.” Williams, who was Bristol West MP from 2005 to 2015 and has previously served as a city councillor, claimed the Greens had not really focused on important local issues during the campaign, such as plans to build hundreds of new harbourside homes and a controversial road scheme. “Almost the entire focus of their campaign has been: ‘Give us another councillor, then we’ll be really big’ and they’ve hardly been talking about local issues. There are 50 things they could have campaigned on. I’m puzzled. Ironically, they’ve been producing an avalanche of leaflets, a forest of them.” Thecandidates for the byelection are: Stephen Williams (Lib Dem), Patrick McAllister (Green), Eileen Means (Labour), Eliana Barbosa (Conservative), Martin Booth (Independent)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Power tools are scary so it’s handheld pruners for my hedges | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","fields":{"bodyText":"I am drowning in prunings, tripping over the stuff every time I try to hang out the washing, and still I have yet to make even a dent in the hedge. If I were a different person I would either get someone else to do it, or at least buy myself the mother of all hedge trimmers and make light work of it all. But I am not that person. I am one who has a deep, and perhaps deeply un-lesbian, distrust of power tools. I just don’t like how fast they go. Thus, my only option is to spend the winter going at it bit by bit, by hand, until one day we can all see the light through the tangle of branches. I already own a Wolf-Garten multi-change tool with a telescopic handle that can reach up to three metres. I’ve got two heads for it: the adjustable anvil tree lopper that cuts through branches up to 40mm in diameter as if they are made of butter; and the professional pruning saw, which rips through anything big with such ease it is slightly terrifying. I can’t recommend these tools highly enough if you’ve got tall things to prune and no space or budget for a serious tripod ladder. You can also, if you have massive hands, take the pruning saw off and use it as a hand saw. If you don’t, I recommend the Silky Natanoko pruning saw from Japan, partly because its handle is smaller and made of rubber. This is a fixed-blade saw with coarse teeth, perfect for fresh wood. Like all Japanese saws, it cuts on the pull, which means it’s less effort, but you must make sure it doesn’t bend as you cut, otherwise it is liable to snap. If this does happen, at least you can replace the blades and, more importantly, you can sharpen them too. It’s an investment, at more than £60, but should last a lifetime if looked after well. If that’s too much, a Z pruning saw with coarse serrations is a very reasonable second choice, costing just over £20. On top of that you’ll need some loppers. I’ve tried many in my time and think most telescopic sorts are just not tough enough. Bypass loppers are great for smaller stuff (under 300mm diameter), but for bigger branches you need to buy the sturdiest anvil loppers you can find, such as a pair of Bulldog compound anvil lopping shears. Then put on a good podcast and get chopping. And all those prunings? Make a deadhedge (a hedge-like collection of pruned branches) or just an artful pile with the bigger stuff, and let it slowly rot back. Dead wood is hugely important to beetles and other insects. The small stuff will rot quickly enough in the compost if it is added fresh."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T23:16:57Z","webTitle":"UK coal-burning power facility to stay open two years longer than planned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/11/uk-coal-burning-power-plant-to-stay-open-two-years-longer-than-planned","fields":{"bodyText":"Part of a Nottinghamshire coal-burning power plant will stay open for two years beyond its planned closure date after a call from ministers prompted by the UK’s energy crisis. Ratcliffe-on-Soar had initially been pencilled in to shut in 2022, but last year said it would have an initial extension until 31 March 2023. The planned closure forms part of the government’s attempt to remove coal from Britain’s energy generation to cut carbon emissions. One of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was due to shut in September 2022, but it will now close in line with three other units at the station in September 2024. Coal-fired plants provided more than 40% of Britain’s electricity a decade ago, but that figure had fallen to 1.5% by last year. Ministers have set a goal for Britain to stop using coal altogether. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to countries boycotting Russian gas. Emergency contracts were drawn up between energy suppliers and National Grid to keep stations open as back-up options. So far none of the coal-fire powered stations asked to stay online this winter as a precaution have been asked to supply power, the Daily Telegraph reports. The power station and its distinctive eight concrete cooling towers can be seen next to the Midland mainline railway line between London and Leeds. The news comes as Britain generated a record amount of electricity from wind turbines on Tuesday. National Grid data showed that 21.6GW of electricity was supplied by wind early in the evening, about 50% of the power needed across Britain at 6pm and 6.30pm. This is a time of day where demand is traditionally high, as people return from work or start to prepare evening meals. It is the second time in two weeks that the wind record has been broken in Britain, after a previous best was set on 30 December. The German energy giant Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire plant, said: “As requested by the government, Uniper is now looking at whether we can make the unit available to run under standard market arrangements until the September 2024 coal phase-out date. “We have prequalified the unit to take part in the capacity market T-1 auction for 2023/24 [an auction for back-up power]. This means further investment to extend the life of the unit. The power station is set to close at the end of September 2024.” A government spokesman said: “The UK has a secure and diverse energy system, and we remain confident in our security of supply. “Working closely with Ofgem, National Grid Gas and other key industry organisations, we continuously monitor our energy supply and ensure we are ready for a range of scenarios. “In line with our net zero target, the government is planning to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation by the end of 2024.” • This article was amended on 12 January and 13 January 2023 to clarify in the text and headline that three of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar were already due to remain open until 2024."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T08:30:12Z","webTitle":"‘No chance’ of global heating below 1.5C but nuclear tech ‘promising’ in climate crisis, Bill Gates says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The world will be lucky to avoid 2.5C of heating, but emerging technology may help avert even worse, Bill Gates has told a Sydney audience. The US billionaire and philanthropist told the Lowy Institute on Monday that while malaria still killed more children – 400,000 a year – the climate crisis was “worth investing in massively because it will get worse and worse over time”. There was “no chance” of limiting warming to the Paris climate goal of 1.5C compared with pre-industrial levels, and it was “very unlikely” it could be kept to 2C, Gates said. “The key is to minimise the warming as much as possible,” he said. “At this point, to stay below 2.5C would be pretty fantastic. I do think that’s possible.” Gates remains among the world’s richest people, despite having donated $US35bn ($50bn) to mid-2022, with his former wife, Melinda Gates, and pledging another $US20bn. Asked about the policies of the government led by Anthony Albanese, whom Gates met over the weekend, the Microsoft founder said it was “great to have Australia on board on climate” after the country had been an “outlier until quite recently”. The country was “very blessed” with renewable energy resources and the minerals needed for a transition away from carbon. “Australia is rare in that the opportunities exceed what you have to give up,” he said. Gates said his investment in the Perth-based firm Rumin8, announced on Monday, was his 103rd foray into climate start-ups, from energy and aircraft to steel. Rumin8 aims to reduce methane emissions from cattle. Nuclear fission and fusion were both “very, very promising” energy sources not dependent on the weather for generation, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Still, he said the government’s approach to wait 15 years for proof that the technology of small modular reactors was safe and cheap and the waste can be handled “was a very good attitude”. “I don’t know whether it will succeed,” he said. “I’ve put billions of dollars into [nuclear technology], so I must think there’s some chance.” “Even if nuclear succeeds, we’re still going to need 60-70% renewables,” Gates said. “I think the world is underinvested in those [nuclear] innovations because they could make a huge difference.” On other issues, Gates said there were still “huge factors pushing for global trade”, even with a “fear of dependency on China”. These include the cross-border need for copper, lithium and cobalt “as part of the green energy revolution”. “It is sad that we’re evolving into a world where [there’s] the willingness, certainly of the US, to be independent of things from China,” he said. “It will create significant inefficiencies if globalisation goes into reverse.” Still, Gates said he was hopeful that major advances were still possible to tackle many health and other issues. “We will cure obesity, we will cure cancer, we will eradicate polio,” he said. “I’m still very optimistic that it will be much better to be born 20, 40, 60 years from now than [at] any time in the past.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T14:00:19Z","webTitle":"Actors are still being put under pressure to perform intimate scenes – I see it happen | Adelaide Waldrop ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","fields":{"bodyText":"Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting’s lawsuit against Paramount for child abuse in Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet highlights the myriad complexities involved in filming intimate scenes. Thanks to modern legislation on child sexual abuse, 55 years on some of the issues raised in this case are no longer risks; but many dangers remain in the television and film sector today. I have worked in the industry for almost as long as an intimacy coordinator can have, given that the role officially originated in 2017. In that time, I’ve choreographed a wide range of intimate scenes – from sci-fi orgies to medieval childbirth. I’ve worked with child actors (who are defined in the UK as those under school leaving age) in scenes where consent and boundaries are needed, for example where children are cuddled or kissed by adult actors playing their parents. Ensuring informed consent when working with an underaged actor is morally ambiguous at best, but there are some hard lines. Child actors cannot legally consent for themselves, nor can they legally perform nude on camera, especially not in a sexual context. Hussey and Whiting were 15 and 16, respectively, when they were filmed naked in Zeffirelli’s classic, ages that would exclude them from the same situation today. A child actor may be made aware of the full context of a scene or they may not be – depending on their age, parent/guardian’s guidance, and the recommendations of a child psychologist. Consent of a parent/guardian is always required, but depending on the age and maturity of a young actor, they may have a limited ability to understand what they are being asked to do, or the potential consequences of their performance living on in perpetuity. Even for adult actors who consent to onscreen nudity or simulated sex, there are complications. How can we be fully confident any actor won’t feel differently about their performance a day, a week or even 50 years down the line? The short answer: there are no guarantees. Part of the intimacy coordinator’s role is to help mitigate this risk as much as possible – not only to protect the actor, but to protect the production’s liability as well. Establishing clear, transparent communication around intimate content early in production is paramount. Ideally, an intimacy coordinator is brought on prior to the casting process, helping ensure that any actor accepting a role with scripted intimacy is doing so from a place of informed consent from the very start. However, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been hired to aid in a casting process this way. In the case of Hussey and Whiting, it appears that in early conversations they were assured that they would not have to perform nude. Later in the shoot, Zeffirelli reportedly changed his mind. Here is where fraught dynamics embedded in the industry continue to permeate and create risk. Often, a director or producer will emphasise that they’ve spoken with an actor who is “fine” or “totally chill” about intimate content, but when the actor has the opportunity to speak with me, they may express significantly different comfort levels. Even with the best of intentions or the most trusting working relationship, the implicit power held by someone well-connected with reverential status who is perceived as a gatekeeper to a notoriously impenetrable industry – and who may have hiring and firing power over an actor who has probably jumped through countless hoops just to get in the room – is undeniable.The most frequent mishandlings of intimacy by productions seem to arise when time pressures and last-minute changes come into play. The job of a producer is to make a project achievable, however they can. The entire production team is composed of creative problem solvers, masters of the quick pivot. However, when these last-minute changes affect the timing or content of an intimate scene, this time pressure is suddenly transferred to an actor and their boundaries. Often it is presented as though there is no other option, no possible solution besides a change to the intimate scene. Productions can make this feel like a monolithic pressure for an actor – or even an intimacy coordinator – to push back on. Despite huge strides made in our understanding of consent, trauma and power since the Weinstein scandal and rise of #MeToo, the TV and film industry remains reluctant to change in some key ways. Many professionals still fail to see why the risks of psychological injury on set deserve the same attention as the risks of physical injury. For actors, who rely on their emotional capacity to do their jobs, a psychological trauma on set can be career-ending (see Last Tango in Paris for a harrowing example). We are going to have to learn to not only change the way we think and talk about consent, but consider what compromises we are willing to make to ensure it is maintained. In the US, Screen Actors Guild contracts are governed by a 48-hour rule: any changes to the content or scope of an intimate scene need to be submitted to an actor’s agent at least 48 hours in advance of filming. This is not yet a legal requirement in the UK, though it is generally considered best practice. I look forward to best practice becoming typical practice. Even with improved legislation, Hollywood has a power problem, and cases like Hussey and Whiting’s remind us that this is nothing new. Unfortunately, it is not, yet, entirely old either. The solution is not only for productions to hire specialists like intimacy coordinators (and access coordinators, and wellbeing coordinators), but to listen and consistently implement their expertise, instead of enlisting them solely as a tick-box exercise. As an industry we need to demonstrate our true willingness to upend some of the longstanding traditions of unhealthy working environments once affectionately written off as “showbiz, baby!”.

Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its forces struck the railway station, prompting condemnation from the US and the EU. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the attack “fits a pattern of atrocities” while the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said those responsible would be held to account. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early on Thursday morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said “several” explosions were heard at about 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, was set to speak to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-24T01:16:10Z","webTitle":"BuzzFeed cooks up new AI-powered recipe generator, Botatouille","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","fields":{"bodyText":"As media companies sort through the ways artificial intelligence will impact their operations, BuzzFeed on Tuesday launched Botatouille, a personalized recipe generator powered by generative AI. In addition to Botatouille, which BuzzFeed describes as, “the first AI-powered culinary companion” that suggests recipes based on factors like what you already have in your refrigerator, there’s also a chatbot feature that allows people to ask culinary questions while they cook, according to a press release from the company. Botatouille, which doesn’t appear to be inspired by the Disney movie about the cartoon rat-chef, is part of a slew of AI-generated content like games and quizzes that BuzzFeed hopes will drive users back to their platform as the brand shut down its award-winning news division earlier this month. BuzzFeed, chief executive Jonah Peretti told investors on 11 May, will “focus on making the internet more fun”. “Readers are sick of all the negative news in their social media feeds,” Peretti told investors. “They will increasingly want social media platforms to provide an escape where they can find entertainment, joy and fun.” BuzzFeed had already told employees in January it had used AI to ‘enhance’ its content and quizzes. Peretti announced the end of BuzzFeed News last month, a move that came after several rounds of deep cuts. The division had won a Pulitzer prize in 2021 for an investigation into China’s mass detention of Muslims. Peretti cited a range of challenges, including the pandemic, declining stock market, a slowdown in digital advertising and changing audience habits. The move was met with deep disappointment from the company’s staff, sharp criticisms of Peretti’s leadership with managing the company and arguments that the layoffs were another example of corporate leadership’s devaluation of workers and eagerness to embrace AI as a replacement for humans. Other news sites that boomed during the 2010s, including Vice and Insider have also struggled as audiences and advertisers moved away from social media and towards video services such as YouTube and TikTok. Insider – formerly known as Business Insider – also announced it was making substantial job cuts the same week that Peretti announced the layoffs at BuzzFeed. After a wave of layoffs and cancelation of its flagship news program, on 15 May Vice filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T01:28:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear plant came close to ‘radiation disaster’, says Zelenskiy, amid calls for urgent UN visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling. The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. “If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said Thursday’s incident represented the plant’s first complete disconnection in its nearly 40 years of operation. Electricity is used for cooling and safety systems. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after Joe Biden spoke to Zelenskiy on Thursday. The US state department also cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site. “The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,” spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. “No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. “We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Writing on Telegram, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, said satellite photos showed the local forest in flames. He said towns in the area lost power for several hours on Thursday. “This was caused by the disconnection of power lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station as a result of provocations by Zelenskiy’s fighters,” Rogov claimed. “The disconnection itself was triggered by a fire and short circuit on the power lines.” Nuclear experts have warned of the risk of damage to the plant’s spent nuclear fuel pools or its reactors. Cuts in the power needed to cool the pools could cause a disastrous meltdown. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The complex supplied more than 20% of Ukraine’s electricity needs and its loss would pile new strain on the government. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive.

The Generation Plan proposed a mix of renewable energy, gas-peaking plants and battery storage, some of which would be on or near Liddell’s site in the New South Wales Hunter Valley. Its sister coal-fired power station, Bayswater, would also get an upgrade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup AGL’s then chief executive, Andy Vesey, estimated the capital investment would total almost $1.4bn, with the new assets operating for as long as 30 years. By contrast, extending Liddell’s life beyond its planned 2022 closure would cost $920m and only add five years to a plant then almost 50 years old. As events transpired, the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Vesey both got rolled on the same day, 24 August 2018. “They lost their PM over energy and we lost a CEO,” one AGL insider says. With Liddell finally shutting on 28 April, business leaders and local officials are hopeful alternative generation projects and manufacturing will eventually fill the site even if few of AGL’s proposed ventures have progressed. “There was initially a level of ‘this is going to be a bit of a shock to the system’,” says Danny Eather, president of Business Singleton, which represents about 180 local businesses. “Liddell is really beyond its lifespan as a facility, and I think there’s a general acceptance within the community that this is what had to happen.” Mike Kelly, president of the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, further up the Hunter Valley, says it’s still unclear what will replace Liddell. “Despite the early notice [of Liddell’s demise], driven by government policy, there is still a lot of uncertainty and cynicism,” Kelly says. “You wouldn’t turn off the town water supply to your house if you were planning to put in big tanks next year,” he says. “And you wouldn’t turn off the grid main supply if you’re planning to put solar panels and wind turbines on your property in the next year or two or five.” Authorities, though, are confident Liddell’s shutdown won’t disrupt the power grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts the state “will maintain a reliable power supply”, says Penny Sharpe, the state’s new energy minister. “Liddell is now more than 50 years old. It’s been unreliable for many years, and not operating at its rated capacity,” Sharpe says. “In 2022, Liddell made around 1,260 megawatts available, a fraction of its 2,000MW rated capacity, and generated only around 7,000 gigawatt-hours across the year.” Vesey’s successor at AGL, Brett Redman, became much more cautious about the rush to invest in new renewables. Plans for a gas-peaker plant near Goulburn and one in the lower Hunter were scrapped altogether, while investments in new batteries and pumped hydro plants at Liddell or nearby have taken longer than expected, insiders say. Management wanted “no additional risk” for coal generation, one of them says. “What was happening in the background was that the business was haemorrhaging cash.” Also disrupting AGL’s intentions were interventions in the market by the Turnbull and then Morrison governments, not least Snowy Hydro’s giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and then its Kurri Kurri gas plant in NSW. These threw the whole Generation Plan “out of the window”, they say. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, is keen to see people move on from that earlier plan. “Forget about this, it is history,” he said during a recent visit to Liddell. Brokhof is proud Bayswater has been able to absorb 100 of Liddell’s 140 staff, meaning AGL kept its promise there would be no forced redundancies. The rest will retire or leave the industry. Bayswater’s crew of 460 will swell to 560, with contractors and sub-contractors being cut to make way for the newcomers. AGL aims to make a final investment decision on a 500MW battery for Liddell “probably in the second half of this year”, Brokhof says. A second battery of the same size may be a future option for a site near the Tomago aluminium smelter, AGL’s biggest customer, also in the Hunter region. A 250MW pumped hydro project about 11km from Liddell that would use a deep coalmine void created by Japan’s Idemitsu Corporation remains at the feasibility study stage. “We are exploring double that [size],” Brokhof says. Hydrogen production is another option for a post-Liddell future. AGL last year expanded a feasibility study involving Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries and other partners to explore development of a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility. Luring other manufacturers to a site well-served with high voltage transmission, roads and railway is another aim of AGL’s. Agriculture may even feature, Brokhof says. A mining engineer by training, Brokhof hails from Dusseldorf, part of the Ruhr region of Germany that has been navigating a transition off mining and heavy industry for decades. “There are thousands of templates” about how to help communities adjust, he said, while walking near Lake Liddell. “Australia is not an island. It’s a bit annoying.” Another insider says locals should expect news of a “big deal” later this year about other companies willing to bring investments. AGL’s Liddell-Bayswater site, bought from the state government for $1.5bn in 2014, covers 10,000 hectares and also about 40% of the high-security water rights in the Hunter. The water licences, linked to the power stations, are among the largest in Australia and roughly equal the total water available to farms and mines in the valley. However, the area’s transition away from fossil fuels may need to speed up, particularly if Bayswater’s closure is brought forward and the mines start to shut. “The latest is 2033,” Brokhof says, referring to the shutdown timing of the 2,640MW plant. The end of a relatively low-cost coal contract in 2028, however, could challenge Bayswater’s economics before then. A reduced operation, such as retaining just one or more of the four units, may be the result, people familiar with the plant say. Steve Reynolds, mayor of Muswellbrook, worries the community won’t be ready for what is coming. “We’re in for a turbulent time, there’s no doubt, with the transformation that is going to happen across this region,” Reynolds says. “We really need that person from the state government, specifically, that’s going to assist us because there’s so many different departments that are siloed under environmental minister, the mining regulator [and so on],” he says. “If we miss this boat, it will be the generations to come that will pay for their failures.” Michele O’Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, says a national energy transition authority is required to improve coordination. “This is something we should have done at least a decade ago and we’ve left many communities without the support needed,” she says. Such a body could help diversify the economy “and create good secure long-term jobs well before closures happen”, O’Neil says. “It can’t just be left up to the market”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T07:00:19Z","webTitle":" Nationwide’s rules left me unable to use my power of attorney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","fields":{"bodyText":"My mother has dementia and now lives in a care home, so I have a power of attorney (POA) to manage her finances.

I have raised a formal complaint but can you help? JT, Cockermouth You found yourself in a catch-22 situation because you could not register your POA with Nationwide as your mother’s only account with it had been closed. The matter was complicated by the building society’s use of your mother’s old address and the mysterious disappearance of the cheque in the post. Nationwide says: “Unfortunately, the power of attorney and address changes weren’t actioned alongside the Isa maturity instructions. This meant that when the cheque didn’t arrive, our member’s daughter was unable to speak to us to resolve the matter. We have now cancelled the original cheque and sent the funds directly to the daughter’s account. We have also contacted her to apologise that her experience fell below our usual high standards and have offered her £200 compensation, which she has accepted.” You are relieved that this problem is resolved but point out that your mother is one of many whose affairs are being managed by a relative and complain that Nationwide failed to engage with you.

Twelve years on Qatar 2022 has now concluded with the same phrase hanging in the air. Project Hard Football Power is complete. And it really could not have gone any better, a micromanaged power play, from the pharaonic-scale nation-building project, to the painted backdrop sets, to the regional visibility that helped see Qatar through the blockade years, to the chance at the death to parade Lionel Messi around the winners’ enclosure like a beaming Guy Fawkes dummy. The winner is ... Qatar! There were layers to that moment of ignition back in December 2010. Blatter’s strange tone spoke to the fact that he also knew he was reading out his own redundancy note, that Qatar’s victory indicated he, Blatter, had lost control of the show. Standing there stiff as a board, Blatter nudged Jérôme Valcke, who looked as if he was about to cry, and ordered him to smile. On the back of that moment the house of Blatter would fall, the regime of the more opaque and unknowable Gianni Infantino would rise. And that stage of the cycle is now done. The most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport is a wrap. But what does it mean? And what next? Qatar 2022 also signalled the end of a few other things. For starters, the end of the pretence, and it was always a pretence, that there is any kind of innocence about Fifa’s World Cup; that this is anything other than a marauding city state, out there circling the globe looking for the next compliant and complicit host to share in its gluttony. Qatar has transformed football: you also hear this a lot. In reality Qatar has simply supercharged what was already there, presented us with football’s standard corruption and hypocrisy stripped of artifice and gleamingly unapologetic. Qatar didn’t invent this world, didn’t invent migrant labour, didn’t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form, like the Beatles taking rock and roll to America. On a more micro level the end of this World Cup is also the end of a generation of great players, perhaps even an end to the age of the modern-day individualist, a lineage that runs though Ronaldinho to Messi. Football is more compressed, more systems-led, more controlled than ever. It seems possible the highest stage may never again see a baggy, strolling 35-year-old conjurer of patterns. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski, goodnight ladies, sweet ladies, good night. And for now, as the comedown starts to bite, there are probably three things worth saying about Qatar 2022. First, the football was excellent. The action on the pitch was luminous, packed with drama and topped with the greatest World Cup final ever staged. There is no meaning to this, no moral to be drawn. The World Cup was good because football is good. This is why Qatar paid $220bn to borrow its light. It is why Fifa will rake in $7bn revenue from the show. This thing is supernaturally resilient, no matter how hard we may try to bend it out of shape. There has been a lot of talk about the breadth and reach of this World Cup, the idea of new powers, a new world order. It is a good propaganda line for the organisers and host broadcasters. In reality eight of the last 16, five of the last eight, two of the final four were European nations. We did get Morocco and the thrill of a first African semi-finalist but even this is more complex. This was also a diaspora triumph, a triumph of expert management and fine domestic facilities, combined with multiculturalism. Seven starting players were products of European club academies and European childhoods, gelled into place with a Moroccan sense of togetherness that seemed to offer a model of how to live these many identities. This story is more nuanced, more interesting than simple parping regionalism. Otherwise the entertainment was derived from dramatic finishes and in-game tension as much as high quality. Take away Messi and there were no really exceptional teams outside France and Argentina. England, Croatia and Morocco were the second rank here. This is some pretty functional football. But they produced great games, plenty of goals, good refereeing and a welcome absence of red cards. Fernando Santos single-handedly saved football by dropping Ronaldo and playing a 21-year-old who scored a hat-trick, one of the great managerial flexes of all time. Croatia were a captivating bunch of super-smart dinosaurs. Brazil did Brazil. And it was all a good job too because a bad World Cup on the pitch might just have fatally wounded the whole idea of international football given the backdrop to this thing. Otherwise Messi wrote the story of Qatar 2022 and did so while manifesting the key paradox of Big Football. Here is a player whose talent expresses freedom, beauty, love, imagination, uplifting human qualities. Messi is basically a sporting unicorn – and a highly unusual unicorn, the kind of unicorn even other unicorns look at and say: ‘That unicorn, he’s a bit special.’ Often the word “player” can feel like a ludicrous anachronism. Play is fun, joy, gratuitous things. Modern football, meanwhile, is a suffocating matrix, all constriction and physicality. Somehow Messi, the greatest footballer of the age, is also a player. At the same time his professional existence is still lived out as a tool of despotic regimes, pegged out around the commoditised global game. Messi is the face of Qatar’s propaganda World Cup. Messi is Saudi Arabia’s tourism ambassador. It is almost an act of unintended rebellion to be all these things and to perform the way he does, the rebel heart to Argentinian football expressed not through any conscious act of will, not through guns and cops and drugs, but through a way of playing, the whisper of a free spirit. Aside from all this, we still have the death. Not to mention suffering, corruption and grotesque monarchical vanity. So many things at this World Cup have seemed to be screaming in horror, from the open mouths of the gleaming stadium roofs, to the frightening cartoon avatars of the Bein Sports graphics, to the mind-numbing universal public address system. The stage was haunted by ghosts. The People’s World Cup was also the dead people’s World Cup. We can argue over the final tally, which is also part of the horror, the lack of care, death as part of life, in the words of the dear old Supreme Delivery Committee. But this has been football as an accessory of the overclass world, football as VVIP product. There are other costs. An otherworldly chill settled over Lusail Iconic Stadium an hour before kick-off in the World Cup final. Rain? Guilt? No, this was the giant-scale air-conditioning, brainchild of Qatar’s famous “Dr Cool”, whose indirect carbon footprint must be one of the most terrifyingly vast on earth. Hopefully Dr Cool also recycles and rides a bike. But we all pay for this in the end. Otherwise this was also a World Cup of illusion and fakery, football in the age of populism and post-truth. Concerns about a lack of care by the hosts have been routinely dismissed with useful, dead-end moral relativism; even described, absurdly, as racism (reality: few things are as racist as a structurally racist state carelessly harming migrant workers). Fifa introduced the idea of “unnatural lost time” at this World Cup and Qatar 2022 has often felt like this, from the artful fakery of Stadium 974, which pretended to be an ecological triumph, to the strange dance of the conscience-laundering armbands, presumably long since burnt on the Al-Wakrah docks like the 1970 squad’s van full of corned beef; to the malleable quality of Infantino who believes in revisiting European oppression from 3,000 years ago, but maintains he can’t be held responsible for what happened at Fifa five years before he became president. Feeling dizzy yet? And this is the final thing worth saying about Qatar 2022, which in the end is simply a mirror to the world. Qatar is not an aberration. Qatar is the way the world works, presented to you with brutal, unapologetic clarity. Other nations may have checks and balances, trades unions, democracy, free speech, ways of mitigating the brutality of rule by an overclass. Doha may also have wilfully neglected its duty of care to migrant workers, explicitly targeting nations suffering most from climate change to build its World Cup, because desperate people are cheap people. This does not have to happen. But in the end the real question about migrant workers is why are migrant workers so poor they are willing to do this, and who benefits from that world? Qatar 2022 may be a bloodstained thing but it is also a light and a lens, a crib-sheet on how the world works. Not to mention its superheated carbon centre. Qatar is the power source. Qatar is the winner: this was not an aberration, but a prophecy. A final note on what might happen next, beyond the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026 and our newly opened book on the morality of World Cup hosts. It was interesting that Michel Platini declined Emmanuel Macron’s invitation to attend the World Cup final. Platini is said to be unwilling to meet Infantino and his circle, whom he sees as malevolent architects of his own downfall. There is genuine enmity here. Platini is also free now of criminal charges. Infantino, newly re-elected, cosying up to world leaders, looks bulletproof. But if anyone knows anything about the things no one knows about, it is perhaps Platini, who doesn’t seem to be done just yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"Piano forte: Cate Blanchett’s Tár costumes set power chic crescendo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s the zeitgeist film that has split opinion. Critically adored, awards contender and praised by Martin Scorsese. On the other hand, slated by the prominent conductor Marin Alsop for being “anti-women” and scoffed at as patronising by younger audiences for belittling cancel culture. But there’s one area in which everybody agrees that Tár, Todd Field’s epic about the reputational downfall of a fictional maestro, excels: the clothes. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) embodies the power-lesbian ideal. Crisp, pale blue button-downs. A cashmere sweater slung over her shoulders when curled up in her gigantic, book-lined brutalist apartment. She marches down the streets of Charlottenburg in a luxe, virgin wool coat with padded shoulders, a silk shirt underneath. Clean lines and sharp silhouettes dominate. It’s the kind of aspirational wardrobe that has made people of all genders swoon – and generated fashion world approval. It was not a reaction that costumer designer, Bina Daigeler – who has worked with Blanchett before on the TV series Mrs America – expected. Usually, her aim is that “nobody should notice the clothes, although they are part of the language of the film … it was a big surprise to me”. But Daigeler knew from her first read of Field’s script that Tár’s sartorial choices were – as with all of us, but perhaps especially in Tár’s case with her self-mythologising – key to her character. Daigeler approached the task with the same level of research as she would a period film. The main theme was clear: power dressing. “I think we all do this – when we need to project strength, we dress in a certain way. [Lydia] Tár is a lot about power and strength.” In response to Alsop’s criticism, Blanchett has said Tár was “not a film about gender but about power”; but her silhouette is often a masculine one. Tár is a wealthy woman. Daigeler mentions Margaret Howell, Max Mara and Dries van Noten, among other high-end labels featured. Studio Nicholson and Lemaire supplied many of the staple pieces. The film’s budget was just $35m, which sometimes proved challenging, with Blanchett at one point joking that they had spent most of it on the Diana coat from The Row (which retails at around £3,000). Tár carries the iconic Hermes Birkin (from £7,000), and, for a woman who talks of controlling time, wears a Rolex (approximately £4,000) with the face turned inwards. Daigeler created an entire wardrobe for Tár, as though she were a real person. Some things were specified by Field in the script – Tár’s baseball cap when travelling incognito. Others were Blanchett’s ideas during fittings: the shirts worn over turtlenecks, for instance, a styling trick seen also at the recent Brioni presentation, one of the most luxe brands in the world. As well as haute designers, Daigeler brought in vintage blouses from stores in Berlin and New York, and a lot of custom pieces: “It was a complete mixture”. Tones were mostly muted to reflect Tár’s severe nature and to “match the grey Berlin skies”. It is also about lifestyle – there is little chance for Tár’s beige and pastel Oxford shirts and knitwear to pick up dirt when doing the school run in her electric Porsche and flying first class. Most important to perfect was Tár’s high-collared penguin tuxedo when conducting. They looked to the Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan, and mostly other past male conductors, for inspiration. “I realised also when I watched Cate in rehearsal [conducting], that it was very important for her to be able to move. But also to have strength in the core. So I made these high-waisted pants to support her,” says Daigeler. There is an extended scene in which Tár visits the tailors and is measured up. As Tár’s world unravels, her put-together look becomes somewhat less put together. Tár is never going to wear jogging bottoms, Daigeler points out, but the outfits become looser, the collars less pressed. The sweaters hang untucked (all in the film are Margaret Howell, which cost about £300). Even trainers and a leather jacket make an appearance. It is about as shabby as the assiduous Tár allows. Given how nice the clothes are, I ask Daigeler if she took any pieces home. She didn’t. For her, “once a job is done it’s done” – but Blanchett did. “There was a very nice Dries van Noten suit which I have seen her in a few times since.” Is there anything accessible for Tár fans who might not have quite the income of a globally famous cultural icon? Try the New York Rangers baseball cap. Yours for £16.50. • This article was amended on 23 January 2023.

The 27 member states burned 17% less fossil fuel to make electricity between January and June 2023 than over the same period the year before, a study from the clean energy thinktank Ember found. The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 – the first year for which they have monthly data – and “very likely” since 2000. The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found. “We’re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,” said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. “We have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.” To try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels. The report found that fossil generation in the first half of 2023 fell more than 20% in 11 EU countries and more than 30% in five of them. Fourteen countries saw their lowest total fossil generation on record for the period. In seven countries – Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Poland and Slovenia – fossil fuel burning hit its lowest levels this century. The findings back up analysis in June from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a nonprofit research organisation, which showed “a clear shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation in the EU”. But even as high energy prices have brought down demand, “the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels persists”, said Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at CREA and co-author of the report. He said: “This dependence extends to external sources as well. Given that a significant portion of the EU’s fossil fuel needs are met through imports from third countries, a vulnerability exists. Even a minor disruption in the supply chain could lead to price hikes and potential energy shortages.” The Ember report found growth in solar power continued in the first half of the year, making 13% more electricity than it did in the same period in 2022. Wind generation rose by 5%, while hydropower grew 11% after a shortfall from widespread drought last year. Nuclear generation fell 4%, but is set to climb during the year. Several countries broke records for the share of their power that came from renewable sources of energy, the report found. Greece and Romania passed 50% for the first time and Denmark and Portugal broke 75%. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, gas prices shot up and the EU introduced emergency measures to cut demand. With winter also unexpectedly mild, demand for electricity fell 5% in the first half of 2023 compared with 2022. The Ember report found some of the drop in demand was down to changes such as using energy more efficiently, but much of the shift was “not sustainable or desirable”. The report called on governments to build wind turbines and solar panels faster. It also said they should “urgently” expand the electricity grid, build more batteries to store electricity and streamline the process to get permits for clean energy infrastructure. “We shouldn’t be complacent about the winter ahead,” said Ewen. “You need to keep pushing.” This article was updated on 30 August 2023 to correct the EU’s emissions targets; they are a cut of 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050, not 65% by 2030 and net zero by 2045."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T19:59:12Z","webTitle":"South Africa’s power game condemns England and Jones to another defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/nov/26/england-south-africa-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"No great escape this time, just cold hard reality. England have no divine right to beat the world champions every time they face them in London but as this contest drifted to its inevitable conclusion there were distinct echoes of the 2019 Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. England were not good enough then and they were similarly outplayed here. South Africa, at the end of a tough old year, fully deserved their first victory over England on this ground since 2014. Their forwards were as flinty as ever but their game-splitting try was a beauty, starting life in the visitors’ own 22 and ending with wing Kurt-Lee Arendse diving into the right corner some 80 metres away. The Springboks have been looking to expand their horizons slightly and here was further proof they have the players to do so. But whither England? Their autumn has been a curious mix of elation and exasperation but it has concluded with boos from the stands and many of the same old questions unanswered. Their calendar year return for 2022 also now makes for pretty uncomfortable reading. P12 W5 D1 L6 is statistically their worst return since 2008. The theory is that England should be judged purely on the World Cup and everything else is mere froth on the pricy Twickenham cappuccino. Which is fine if they go on and lift the Webb Ellis Cup next year. But, for whatever reason, this is a team that only seems to start playing when it has absolutely nothing to lose. Without the 60th-minute red card shown to South Africa’s Thomas du Toit, the final scoreline might have been even more lop-sided. Considering South Africa have also been beaten by both Ireland and France in recent weeks, it leaves Eddie Jones with much to ponder. If the idea is to blast past South Africa’s ‘Bomb Squad’ in the second half, the starters need to give them some kind of platform. A penny, too, for the thoughts of Rassie Erasmus, banned from matchday duties for his social media posts about referees. How he would have loved to have been on the field at the end, lapping up a result that will sooth a lot of green and gold angst. In terms of power and dynamism England’s pack finished a distant second even after Du Toit’s departure and, as a direct result, there was little cohesion behind the scrum either. From the moment Freddie Steward dropped a routine early high ball and his captain Owen Farrell tugged two of his first three penalties wide it felt like a hard day’s night from a home perspective. The Springboks were significantly more alert from early on. A smart variation to the front of the lineout almost yielded a try for Siya Kolisi only for the visiting skipper to be held up over the line, and England were soon spending an ominous amount of time in their own half. Manu Tuilagi, on his 50th England appearance, had a couple of early rumbles but was otherwise mostly a spectator. Tactically the Boks were also spot on. Midfield space was so scarce initially that it made complete sense for the quietly impressive Damian Willemse to slip back into the pocket and drop a goal to make it 6-3. England, by contrast, stuck to a playbook that was bearing little fruit. Marcus Smith kept launching predictable high balls and, with just over half an hour gone, the Springboks burst into counterattacking life. Willemse nipped away from Steward, linked nicely with Faf de Klerk and Willie le Roux and the nippy Arendse scooted away for his seventh try in as many Tests. Twickenham, the only disco in the world where drum and bass interchanges with Jerusalem, fell quiet. When De Klerk chipped over another penalty to make it 14-3 just before the interval it also left England with another second half mountain to climb. To be well behind at half-time to strong southern hemisphere opposition is unfortunate. To do so twice in eight days, as Oscar Wilde might have concluded, felt like carelessness. Inside two minutes of the restart England’s task became even harder courtesy of Willemse’s second drop goal, this time from 40 metres. It revived memories of Jannie de Beer’s fusillade of drop goals in the quarter-finals of the 1999 World Cup and prompted a midfield dust up between the increasingly upbeat South African forwards and their frustrated opposite numbers. By now things were threatening to unravel completely for the reshuffled hosts. With Tom Curry in the sin bin, the giant Eben Etzebeth crashed over for his side’s second try and De Klerk’s conversion and subsequent penalty made it 27-6. Despite Henry Slade’s 72nd minute consolation score there was to be no All Black-style resurrection. So add up England’s November efforts and what do you have? The angst against Argentina, the jaunt against Japan, the near miss against New Zealand and now this blitz to the Boks. Nine months remain until next year’s World Cup but the English public are not currently expecting much. Jones has rotated his starting XV to little obvious effect and other nations have England’s number. For a team with lofty ambitions in 2023, a solitary win over a below-par Japan from four autumn Tests is simply not good enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T00:53:21Z","webTitle":"Nuclear attack in Ukraine should spark ‘devastating’ Nato response, says Poland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","fields":{"bodyText":"Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said Nato’s response to any use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine should be non-nuclear but “devastating”. Speaking on a visit to Washington, Rau said the alliance was in the process of delivering that message to Moscow. The Russian military debacle in Ukraine, where its forces are being pushed back in the east of the country, has increased concerns that a desperate Vladimir Putin could resort to using a nuclear weapon, possibly a lower-yield tactical warhead, in a bid to shock Ukraine into halting its resistance to his invasion. “To the best of our knowledge, Putin is threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, not to attack Nato, which means that Nato should respond in a conventional way,” Rau told the NBC News program Meet the Press NOW. “But the response should be devastating. And I suppose this is the clear message that the Nato alliance is sending to Russia right now.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned on Sunday that any nuclear use by the Kremlin would have “catastrophic consequences for Russia”, which had been “spelled out” in private conversations with Russian officials. The Russian military has expanded conscription with the official aim of sending 300,000 more soldiers into Ukraine, though there are reports the real goal is considerably more. The mobilisation has triggered unrest and an exodus across Russia’s borders, particularly of draft-age men. “Obviously, President Putin is losing the war in Ukraine,” Rau said. “So his reaction to it is to launch mobilisation. But the mobilisation doesn’t seem to help him win the war.” The Polish foreign minister said Ukraine’s armed forces had already defeated Russia’s professional soldiers, so the new conscripts who were “poorly trained and poorly equipped” were unlikely to change the course of the war. Rau said that if the mobilisation did lead to a breakthrough, it would be in Russian public opinion. “So far, the war was popular, at least for the majority of the Russian population, up to 80%,” he said. “And now, every Russian family will have to take their own position towards the war, knowing that their loved ones can be sent there and they can be killed there.” During his trip to Washington, Rau is not meeting any members of the Biden administration, but will see congressional leaders, Sullivan’s predecessor as national security adviser, John Bolton, and will visit a new museum in the US capital dedicated to the victims of communism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T18:16:40Z","webTitle":"Ukraine plans power cuts after Russian strikes on plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has introduced an emergency schedule of power cuts to help stabilise the country’s energy supply, which has been badly damaged by more than 300 Russian drone and missile attacks over the past 10 days as the weather turns cooler. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said people needed to be “especially conscious of electricity consumption” from 7am and avoid using unnecessary appliances as he warned of local “stabilisation blackouts”. Three energy facilities were destroyed by Russia on Wednesday, the president said, with a further strike reported in the region of the southern city of Kryvyi Rih overnight amid growing official alarm over the impact of the Russian campaign. In video remarks to an EU summit on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia hoped to provoke a new wave of migration to European countries. “Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems with electricity and heat as possible for Ukraine this autumn and winter, so that more Ukrainians go to European countries,” he said. In response, he said, allied nations should provide more anti-aircraft systems and impose additional sanctions on Iran, which produces some of the drones Moscow is using. Kyiv and other parts of the country had enjoyed an unseasonably warm spell in mid-October, but on Thursday the weather was markedly cooler. The capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced the start of the “heating season”, where municipal boilers are turned on to heat apartment blocks. Earlier this week the president said 30% of Ukraine’s power plants had been destroyed in eight days, prompting pleas from the country for air defence systems from the west, which appeared to have been caught by surprise. There have been more than 300 strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities since 10 October, when the Russian campaign started, said Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister. To help cope, the government was seeking a 20% reduction in energy use. Some strikes have caused relatively minor damage, which engineers have been able to repair, but government insiders have acknowledged the destruction of some facilities is significant and could take more than a year to repair. A Russian airstrike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn, in western Ukraine, on Wednesday. It caused “quite serious” damage, the governor of the Ivano-Frankivsk region, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said on Ukrainian television. Ukraine’s electricity transmission company, Ukrenergo, warned local blackouts of up to four hours may take place around the country at times between 7am and 10pm, because the energy system had suffered an “attack of the enemy greater than in eight months of war”. The public were told to charge phones and other batteries overnight, while street lighting would be limited in cities. All regions of the country would be affected, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office. The whole north-east region of Sumy, which borders Russia, said it would go the entire day without electric transport, street lighting and water, from 7am to 11pm. A wave of drone strikes hit Kyiv on Monday morning in the district around the airport, killing five when a residential building was hit, but on Wednesday further attacks aimed at the capital were successfully intercepted. The president said 10 Iranian-made drones were destroyed in the Kyiv area that day – and a total of 233 had been shot down during all of October, although the figures cannot be independently verified. The relatively cheap drones are frequently inaccurate, causing civilian casualties, as they explode near power plants around the country. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while Moscow has claimed the Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2, are made locally. But experts say there is little doubt about the origin of the drones, which have a distinctive delta wing shape – and that position was boosted by a slip on Russian television. Ruslan Pukhov, from the Moscow-based thinktank Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, asked journalists before a television interview not to question him on the origin of the drones, unaware that he was live on air. “We all know that they are Iranian-made, but authorities haven’t acknowledged that,” he said. The German chancellor said Russia was using energy and hunger as weapons. “Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,” Olaf Scholz told the German parliament. But the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said Scholz had forgotten the lessons of history, referring to the second world war: “The German chancellor has clearly forgotten the Nazi past of his country and the 30 million Soviet people who were killed or died of hunger and cold during the war.” British intelligence said comments made by Russia’s principal commander, Gen Sergei Surovikin, on Tuesday that “a difficult situation has emerged” in the Kherson area meant it was likely the Kremlin was “seriously considering a major withdrawal of their forces” from west of the Dnieper River. Their position “looks shaky”, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, later told MPs. Ukrainian troops are trying to advance on the city and are believed to be making progress, although their efforts are shrouded in operational secrecy. Oleksiy Hromov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff, said Russia may leave only newly conscripted troops west of the river as it tries to evacuate up to 20,000 more-experienced soldiers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Putin has gone mad from power’: Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight and a half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha. It may take regime change before Yashin, 39, tastes freedom again. Some Russians have taken to coining the jail terms handed down to activists and dissidents as PPZh, an acronym for “while Putin is alive”. In Yashin’s case, he admits that his release date is “difficult to predict”. “Obviously, I will have a chance to get out of prison if the government changes in Russia,” he said. But this is “not a question of today or tomorrow. It is clear that Putin’s goodwill cannot be counted on. He hates people who have publicly opposed military aggression in Ukraine and considers them enemies.” Long before Yashin’s arrest last summer, he knew he was in danger. Police had told a girlfriend he was a “step away from prison”, while a lawyer had told him bluntly that “if I did not leave Russia in the coming days, I would end up behind bars”, he said. Friends and family spoke to him about emigrating. “But none of my family manipulated me with a feeling of guilt and urged me to run away,” he said. “And I am very grateful for that.” Yashin appears at peace with his decision to follow the arduous path of a modern Russian dissident. A veteran of the protest scene that turned out on Bolotnaya Square alongside Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov in 2011, he has evolved from a whiz-kid of the Russian opposition to something like its grizzled wartime conscience. And he seems hellbent – through his own example now – to prove there is a solid bedrock of Russians who oppose the war against Ukraine. “Why did I refuse to emigrate?” he wrote. “Because from the first day of the fighting, I understood that an anti-war voice should be speaking in Russia. It should speak as loudly as possible under the circumstances. Putin has done everything to silence the opponents of the attack on Ukraine. He intimidated Russians, he established military censorship, forced his critics abroad under threat of arrest. The Kremlin did its best to create the illusion of mass, total support for military aggression in Russian society. And I live here and I know that there is no total support, that many are against the war.” It is a thesis to which Yashin will return as he descends deeper into Russia’s vast network of holding cells, jails and prisons. He has already been moved five times in the past eight months, including a trip to Udmurtia, more than 600 miles from Moscow. In the Bear, his fellow prisoners include generals, deputy ministers, wealthy businessmen and a few political prisoners. But his cellmates were all arrested on drug charges. “Strangely enough, I very rarely meet sincere supporters of the war and Putin’s aggressive policy behind bars,” he wrote. “People here don’t really trust the Russian state at all, have faced injustice and are offended by the authorities.” Those imprisoned for “economic” crimes are more likely to be vocal opponents of the war, he wrote, including businessmen, lawyers and other professionals. “The rhetoric of such prisoners is usually very radical: they have seen the system from the inside, know how rotten and corroded it is by corruption, consider themselves victims of this system.” But there are others ready to go to fight despite rumours, Yashin said, of overwhelming losses and outrage that prisoners are being used as cannon fodder. As a rule, he said, they are either the very poor or the very desperate, those who have been given long prison terms for serious crimes and see war as “their only chance to gain freedom”. On a prison train to Udmurtia, he said, he met a 48-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for murder and robberies. He compared his decision to enlist as a mercenary to playing Russian roulette. “The stake in this game is life and freedom,” he said. “Moreover, with whom to fight and whom to kill, it does not matter to him … It’s like an animal instinct: just to break out of the cage, just to survive, just to get the sentence overturned.” What were sometimes called the “vegetarian” years of Putin’s rule, the days before political assassinations, mass crackdowns and full-scale invasions, are over. Russia’s democratic opposition is deep in the weeds. Navalny, its most prominent figure, was nearly poisoned to death and has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison. Yashin, for his part, suggested that with “empty hands” Russia’s opposition would be powerless to enact change from within. “There will be no opposition under Putin’s regime,” he wrote. “For the formation of a normal democratic system, its dismantling is required.” Asked what the west could do to help, he said he thought it could “send a clear signal to the Russian people that it does not consider them an enemy”. Russians needed an alternative to Putin’s imperialism, which brought death and poverty, isolation, corruption, arbitrariness, he added. “It would be a big mistake if the rhetoric and sanctions policy of the west degenerate into Russophobia.” Remarks like these have put Yashin at odds with some of Ukraine’s most ardent supporters abroad. They have said millions of Russians are to blame just as much as Putin for the war. Yashin has always argued the opposite, that “our society has also become a victim of Putin”. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t idealise my people,” he wrote. “Yes, unfortunately we have allowed this criminal power into the Kremlin. People believed the propaganda, allowed themselves to be manipulated, did not control officials and security forces. All this is our responsibility. But this does not mean that the Russian people deserve to be defamed.” In prison, Yashin said, he devotes his time to reading, answering letters from supporters and journalists, and recording his observations for a book. He makes small sketches that “are not very skilled from an artistic point of view but reflect the atmosphere of Russian captivity”. Yashin has called the killing of Nemtsov in 2015 one of the two worst nights of his life. The other was Putin’s announcement of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether he thought his own life was at risk, he replied: “It is difficult to talk about this topic. After Nemtsov’s shooting at the Kremlin walls, Navalny’s poisoning, mass killings in Ukraine, you can expect anything from this government. “But, to be honest, I try not to think about it. Just to keep from going crazy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
