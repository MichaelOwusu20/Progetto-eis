The prime minister will discuss domestic nuclear projects with leaders from the nuclear industry at a roundtable meeting at Downing Street, No 10 said. Johnson is expected to publish the government’s energy security strategy later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a cost of living crisis even before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy. The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. Nuclear power plants currently provide about a sixth of the UK’s electricity. Johnson has previously announced that he intends to remove fossil fuels from UK electricity generation by 2035, and has also argued that the country should invest in more domestic nuclear and renewable energy in order to become more self-sufficient. No 10 officials said topics expected to be discussed at the roundtable meeting include how government and industry can work together to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply. Downing Street added that nuclear power is a “safe, clean and reliable energy source”. Last November, the government agreed to invest in a new generation of mini-nuclear reactors, being developed by engineering firm Rolls-Royce. Ministers hope that these small modular reactors, or SMRs, will be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors – such as the Hinkley Point C project – which pose considerable construction risks and are often beset by spiralling costs and delays. Johnson told Conservative members at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool over the weekend that the government was going to place some “big bets on nuclear power”, including backing SMRs and larger projects. However, some environmental experts have raised concerns over how to safely dispose of nuclear waste after the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Labour has said it supports building more nuclear sites, and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called on Sunday for ministers to “get on with the investment in new nuclear”, as well as renewable energy. Johnson is also due to meet executives from the wind sector in the coming days as he looks to bolster domestic energy sources from all available quarters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-18T06:40:08Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: court upholds acquittals of three Tepco executives over disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Three former executives from the company that operates the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have had their not-guilty verdicts upheld by a court in Japan, dealing a blow to campaigners demanding the firm take legal responsibility for the disaster in March 2011. The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death. The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986. The three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japan’s recorded history. More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. Wednesday’s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019. The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe. A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 – three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it. The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the government’s evaluation, saying the defendants “could not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in height”, Kyodo reported. Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepco’s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay ¥13.32tn (£80bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster. In contrast to Wednesday’s decision, the court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures. While that ruling – the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster – carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan. Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-07T20:37:42Z","webTitle":"Money talks: how Saudi Arabia's soft power project is shaking up sport | Sean Ingle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/07/saudi-arabia-deal-pga-major-step-sportswashing-golf","fields":{"bodyText":"Looking back, so much of it was already there on that night in Diriyah when a storm raged across the desert and Anthony Joshua made history – and £60m – by retaining his world heavyweight title belts. Not just the good, the bad and the ugly of Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions, but the accommodations of those willing to take the money and look the other way. One moment from the fight in December 2019 lingers more than most: Joshua absorbing the cheers from the young crowd, many of whom were women in western clothes, before averting his gaze upwards towards the kingdom’s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and giving a fist-pump to the man who had made it all possible. It felt disconcerting yet no one was really surprised. A couple of days earlier, Joshua had responded to questions about human rights by insisting the Saudis were “trying to do a good job politically” before adding: “I just came here for the boxing opportunity. I look around and everyone seems pretty happy and chilled. I’ve not seen anyone in a negative light out here, everyone seems to be having a good time.” Perhaps Joshua was unwilling to delve any deeper for fear that those dissenting whispers would permanently stain his conscience. He was the first global sports star to display a sunny-side-up approach to the kingdom rarely seen outside its own PR campaigns, but far from the last. Only this week Bryson DeChambeau claimed the Saudis were “trying to do good for the world and showcase themselves in a light that hasn’t been seen in a while” by setting up LIV Golf. Meanwhile, taking it all in was Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, who sported the look of a man whose lottery numbers had just come in on the same day he had hit an 11-team accumulator. “This really feels like a really big moment where everything could change,” he told me. “If they’re going to be investing this kind of money in the sport, we’ve got to be realists.” It was a comment to make Henry Kissinger purr. But Hearn was merely ahead of the game. That Joshua fight put the world on notice about how serious Saudi Arabia was about sport. The acquisition of Newcastle United, and the hosting of Formula One and high-profile golf events confirmed it. On Tuesday the Saudi regime flexed their muscles further by striking a deal with the PGA Tour to merge with LIV, backed by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). At the same time they are also throwing impossible sums to attract western players to the Saudi Pro football league. The question now is what happens next. Saudi Arabia has not officially bid for the 2030 World Cup, but that is only a matter of time. Cricket is also said to be of interest, especially with so many of the population from Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. Esports is another major focus – next month it will host Gamers8, which is billed as the world’s largest gaming and esports festival. But wherever the Saudis go next, they have reminded us of two age-old truisms: money wins – and most people have a price where they will do business. As Saudi Arabia’s sporting ambitions grow, people continue to wonder what lies behind it all. We live in a world that prefers certainty over nuance, simple answers not complex truths. But the following is all true: it is about sportswashing, using sport as a tool of soft power, and improving the lives of its population, 70% of which is under 35, and diversifying its economy, all at the same time. According to the Saudis, the value of their sports event industry is growing by 8% per year, rising from $2.1bn in 2018 to an estimated $3.3bn by next year. It wants to have more people coming to Saudi Arabia, playing golf and spending their pounds, dollars and euros in the country. People also tell me that the rate of change since I was there is dazzling. I can believe it. Yet it will not be able to wash away its human rights record that easily. Not when in the last 15 months, it has jailed a woman, Salma al-Shehab, for 34 years for merely following and retweeting dissidents and activists. And also executed 81 people in one day. According to the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, 41 of those killed were Muslims from the Shia minority “who had taken part in anti-government protests in 2011-12, calling for greater political participation”. That should sicken us all. Yet for too many people sporting success trumps human rights. As Ben Freeman, a research fellow at the Quincy Institute for responsible statecraft, puts it when asked about Newcastle United’s supporters cheering on their owners: “A lot of sports fans are easily bought off. If somebody buys their team, they support them. Even if it happens to be an authoritarian government, like the Saudis.” In other words, sportswashing works. Of course there is hypocrisy here too. Sporting stars and supporters are hammered for taking the Saudi coin, while at the same time few question Britain when it exports billions of pounds in weapons to the country and receives billions of pounds in foreign investment in return. Meanwhile, the Saudis’ influence on sport is only going to grow, as Rory McIlroy painfully acknowledged on Wednesday. “The PIF and the Saudis want to spend money in the game of golf and they are not going to stop,” McIlroy said. “Would you rather have one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds as a partner or an enemy? At the end of the day money talks, and you’d rather have them as a partner.” As a statement of cold, hard realpolitik it was hard to argue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/live/2023/sep/08/uk-renewable-auction-contracts-offshore-wind-energy-stock-market-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-08T15:09:12Z","webTitle":"UK interest rates now expected to peak at 5.5%; offshore wind power auction flops – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/sep/08/uk-renewable-auction-contracts-offshore-wind-energy-stock-market-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/sep/08/uk-renewable-auction-contracts-offshore-wind-energy-stock-market-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time for a quick recap. Financial markets now only expect one more quarter-point interest rate rise by the Bank of England before it reaches the end of its rate-hiking cycle. That would take Bank rate up to 5.5%, possibly as soon as later this month. The UK government has been criticised after no offshore wind developers took part in the government’s annual auction to support renewable schemes. Porous concrete has been detected at the UK’s two busiest international airports, Heathrow and Gatwick. Heathrow must also cut passenger charges by almost a fifth next year after losing an appeal to the UK competition watchdog. China’s currency has slipped to a new 16-year low, after weak trade data this week. A measure of UK employment trends used by the Bank of England has shown that employers fear a recesssion and are cutting back on new hiring. Costa Coffee has recalled some of its range of sandwiches and wraps after it emerged that they could contain small stones. Here are the rest of today’s stories: The UK’s concrete crisis has spread to the country’s busiest airports. The Financial Times is reporting that Heathrow and Gatwick have both detected RAAC, the type of concrete that recently forced hundreds of UK schools to close. This shows the far-ranging prevalence of RAAC, which is prone to corrosion and cracking as it ages, the FT points out. The airports say they were aware of the issue before the government ordered 147 schools to immediately shut buildings made with aerated concrete. RAAC is a particular concern in buildings that have been poorly maintained, which shouldn’t include major international airports. Chris Goodier, professor of construction engineering and materials at Loughborough University, and one of the UK’s few experts on Raac, told the FT the presence of the material poses much less of a threat at airports than at schools and hospitals. Goodier says most airport maintenance staff will have been aware of the presence of the material for some time, explaining: “There are people there running the place seven days a week with a big full-time maintenance team whose only job is to keep it running 24/7.” “They’ve got money and they spend money because if they had to close a building it would cost them a lot. Newsflash: The Bank of England is expected to only raise UK interest rates one more time, to 5.5%, in its battle to cool inflation. The money markets this afternoon indicate there is less than a 50% chance that Bank rate will rise above 5.5% this year, or in 2024. Currently, UK interest rates are 5.25%, with the Bank broadly expected to raise them by a quarter of one-percent later this month. But 5.5% could be the peak, the current trading in interest rate swaps suggests. Reuters has the details: Rate futures at 2pm GMT showed a 69% chance of a quarter-point rate rise to 5.5% on Sept. 22 after the BoE’s next meeting, down from more than 80% early this week. The chances of a further rate rise to 5.75% stood at 46% by December and peak at 49% by February 2024, with investors expecting cuts in rates to begin in around a year’s time. Earlier this summer, the money markets indicated UK interest rates would hit 6% as the BoE struggled to bring down inflation. But in July, the consumer price index fell by more than expected, to 6.8%. And on Wednesday, BoE governor Andrew Bailey predicted we will see a “quite marked” fall in inflation by the end of this year. He told MPs that the Bank of England is “much nearer” to ending its run of interest rates increases. There has been “some interest” from potential buyers to snap up Wilko’s warehouses, where around 1,300 people worked before the company collapsed, according to the GMB union today. The GMB says: “We have been working with several associations with a view of finding potential buyers for the warehouses in the hope that they will re-employ many of you. “We are pleased to say we have had some interest in this, and we will vigorously chase these up in the hope of gaining new opportunities for you.” Earlier this week administrators said that 299 people would lose their jobs at the warehouses in Worksop and Newark. More redundancies there have been expected as so far no one has bid to buy the sites. Following today’s auction flop, ministers must recognise that the economic breezes have shifted and that offshore wind, while still cheaper than the alternatives, is not as cheap as it was, our financial editor Nils Pratley writes: He explains that the government should have heeded warnings from the industry that the cost of building offshore windfarms was rising, so they would not pitch to build turbines in the North Sea on the terms the government was offering. As Nils explains: Grant Shapps, the energy security secretary until last week, reacted to the looming crunch by fiddling around the edges. He refused to budge on the £44 maximum but added to the pot of money available to write contracts at that price. From offshore developers’ point of view, they were just being offered more of what they did not want. The tweak was never going to alter the economics. A more generous interpretation is that ministers consciously played hardball and accepted the risk of a failed auction in the hope that prices settle down in time for next year’s event. That, at least, would have a superficial logic. Yet the practical problem is that any imagined “saving” will probably be consumed by the need to catch up to try to save the 50GW target. The developers’ negotiating hand has just improved for the next auction. Therein lies the sense of managing the expansion of windfarms at a steady pace. The UK government’s “fiscal frugality” collided with rising renewable costs at today’s energy support auction, say Capital Economics. They explain: The UK government’s failure to award any new offshore wind-power contracts in its latest procurement round ultimately stems from bean-counting stinginess and is nothing that a lot of extra government investment won’t fix. But with the days of ever-cheaper renewables behind us, the news supports our view that the green transition will put greater pressure on the public finances than many make out. Elsewhere in the markets, China’s renmimbi has weakened to a new 16-year low today. In onshore domestic trading, the yuan closed at its weakest since December 2007. Reuters attributes the weakness to capital outflow pressures as China’s economy struggles, adding: A growing yield gap with other major economies, particularly the United States, has also put fresh pressure on the yuan and a number of other emerging currencies. Trade data released yesterday showed another drop in Chinese imports and exports, indicating its economy is not bouncing back from the Covid-19 lockdowns which ended at the end of last year. A strong dollar is not helping the renmimbi either, as Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: The dollar is on track for its longest winning streak since 2014, driven by a string of robust economic data points that suggest it could be more difficult for the Fed to end this rate hiking cycle. Meanwhile the offshore yuan weakened to its lowest level on record against the greenback after China set its fixing at a two-month low overnight. The weak economic backdrop in China which contrasts with the resilience of the US have both contributed towards widening interest rate differentials, a weaker yuan, and stronger US dollar. In the financial markets, European stocks are on track for their longest losing streak in almost seven years. The Stoxx 600, which tracks listed companies across Europe, has already fallen for seven days running – and is now down 0.1%. We’ve not seen eight days of losses since Octover 2016. Investors are jittery about the state of the eurozone economy, after growth in the second quarter of 2023 was revised down to 0.1%, from an initial estimate of 0.3%. Beijing’s crackdown on iPhone use is also weighing on the tech sector, after knocking Apple’s share price down. Plus, there’s anxiety that central bankers will leave interest rates higher for longer than hoped, after US weekly unemployment claims fell yesterday. Transatlantic broker Redburn Atlantic has published an informative note about today’s renewables auction results. They point out that the possibility that no offshore wind contracts would be awarded was “widely understood”, due to… .….the offshore wind ceiling price of £44/MWh for bids (2012 terms), which is uneconomic for offshore wind projects at today’s financial/supply chain costs. While the implicit capital discipline shown by renewable developers is good in itself, the result is further evidence of the implied political challenge posed by the offshore wind industry - will regulatory bodies accept that offshore wind has become much more expensive in future auctions? They will need to if they want capacity expansion to come anywhere close to current targets. This charts from Redburn Atlantic show the results of the latest auction (in light blue) vs last year’s auction (darker blue), for capacity: And for the average clearing prices under the contracts for difference auction: In another sign of weakening in the UK housing market, the number of planning permissions granted across England for new houses has fallen to a record low. The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said planning permissions continued to fall “sharply”, with the number of homes approved in first half of 2023 down by 19%. The latest data confirms industry warnings that in the midst of an increasingly “anti-development” policy environment and worsening economy, the number of homes built in the coming years could fall to record low levels, said the HBF. Around 2,456 projects were granted planning permission during the second quarter of the year, the lowest since similar records began in 2006, said the report. This number is 10% lower than the previous quarter and 20% lower than a year ago. Three geothermal projects have won government support in today’s auction for renewable energy support. The Manhay, Penhallow and United Downs projects, all in Cornwall, were all allocated support through the Contracts for Difference Allocation Round, to produce a total of 12MW of power. Conservative MP Kieran Mullan, who produced an academic study into geothermal for the government this year, has welcomed this “landmark investment”. That report found that many areas with the greatest geothermal potential lie beneath the towns and cities most in need of investment. Mullan says: “The government has stepped up its investment in deep geothermal in a big way today, funding not one but three deep geothermal plants. This follows on from the first UK deep geothermal heat plant being in 37 years being switched on at the Eden project in Cornwall this summer.” “This just proves the huge potential out there. These projects will deliver clean, reliable electricity that doesn’t wax and wane with the weather like wind and solar. I hope this is just the start of what could be an important part of our transition, particularly when it comes to heat where there are even more potential sites. Deep geothermal energy is heating more than 250,000 homes in Paris and many more across Europe. It is a clean, green, reliable resource. I got to see for myself how quietly and efficiently this hot water can be utilised visiting a plant in Germany. No one would know the little building I visited next to a park and a school was heating the local swimming pool, businesses, town hall and hundreds of homes.” Berkeley Group has become the latest house builder to be hit by slowing demand for new homes. Reservations for new homes at the upmarket builder have fallen 35% by value in the last four months, reflecting the “elevated macroeconomic and political volatility”. However, prices are “resilient” and it still expects to make a pretax profit of at least £1.05bn in the current year and beyond. Like other builders, Berkeley complained about the planning system, and has not bought any land, saying: “The complexity and protracted nature of the current planning system and lack of clarity surrounding certain regulatory changes affecting our sector, at a time of considerable uncertainty for the UK economy with persistent high inflation and interest rates, continues to deter investment into brownfield regeneration and the wider housebuilding sector. Consequently, Berkeley has not acquired any land in the period and will only invest very selectively in new opportunities.” Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said: “In some ways, Berkeley is a different beast to many of its competitors, with a potential edge coming from its mix of an exposure to London and the South East, higher-end properties and the regeneration of brownfield sites in which it is well accomplished. The group has also reined back its land acquisition, making no purchases in this period and with the intention of only investing very selectively in new opportunities.” But he added: “Berkeley is far from being immune to the wider issues of mortgage availability and affordability, planning bottlenecks, uncertain consumer propensity to buy and a cloudy outlook.” World food price have fallen to their lowest level in two years, new data from the United Nations food agency shows. The Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, fell to 121.4 points in August, down from 124.0 for July. That’s the lowest since March 2021, according to Reuters. It means global food prices are 24% below the peak reached in March 2022, after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The drop reflected declines in the price indices for dairy products, vegetable oils, meat and cereals, while the sugar price index increased moderately, the FAO explains. The UK government botched today’s offshore wind auction, say Friends of the Earth, who are urging the new energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, to sort out her “failing” department. Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth’s head of policy, said: “The failed offshore wind auction was highly predictable. The government has missed yet another open goal that would have boosted energy security and made household bills more affordable. “Since energy bills shot up last year, ministers have refused to invest in home insulation, despite our housing stock being amongst the worst in Europe and failed to unleash the full potential of our vast onshore wind resources. This week’s wind reforms don’t go nearly far enough. “Now it’s botched an auction that should have led to a boom in offshore wind with all the economic benefits this would bring. The new Secretary of State, Claire Coutinho needs to get a grip on her failing department - and quickly.” No new offshore windfarms will go ahead in the UK after the latest government auction, in what critics have called the biggest clean energy policy failure in almost a decade, our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose explains. None of the companies hoping to build big offshore windfarms in UK waters took part in the government’s annual auction, which awards contracts to generate renewable electricity for 15 years at a set price. The companies had warned ministers repeatedly that the auction price was set too low for offshore windfarms to take part after costs in the sector soared by about 40% because of inflation across their supply chains. The government confirmed on Friday that only 3.7 gigawatts of new clean energy projects secured a contract, compared with 11GW in the previous auction – a significant blow to the UK’s clean energy targets. The winning projects include solar farms, onshore windfarms and a record number of tidal power projects. However, the absence of giant new offshore windfarms will make the UK’s climate targets far more difficult to achieve. The government’s “energy security disaster” means the UK will miss out on billions in investment and may also push up bills for hardworking households, the Labour party warned. Industry insiders said the three biggest offshore wind developers in the UK – SSE, ScottishPower and the Swedish company Vattenfall – were forced to sit out the bidding after ministers refused to heed their warnings. A measure of UK employment trends used by the Bank of England has shown that employers fear a recesssion and are cutting back on new hiring. The latest KPMG and REC, UK jobs report found that the number of employers hiring sank to its lowest since 2009, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic period, while the number of people looking for work remained steady. One analyst said the report, compiled by S&amp;P Global, indicated that the economy was showing clear signs of strain after 14 consecutive interest rate rises and put pressure on the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) to halt further increases in the cost of borrowing at the next meeting later this month. “In one line,” the jobs report supported “a swift conclusion to the MPC’s tightening cycle,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The permanent staff placements index fell to 38.9 in August, from 42.4 in July. It averaged 54.2 in the second half of the 2010s, and 55.3 in 2022, said Tombs. A number below 50 indicates contraction. The permanent staff availability index, which measures the number of people using recruiters to look for work, edged down to 60.3 in August, from 61.4 in July, but remained well above its 38.0 average in the second half of the 2010s, and its 37.6 average in 2022. Salary rises also remained broadly steady, with the permanent staff salaries index at 58.2 in August, compared to 58.3 in July. It averaged 60.0 in the second half of the 2010s, and 71.8 in 2022, said Tombs. “August’s jobs survey provides more ammunition to the core members of the MPC -governor Andrew Bailey and chief economist Huw Pill – who have recently expressed their view that interest rates probably don’t need to rise much further, if at all, in order to sustainably return inflation to the 2% target.” The MPC regularly comments on REC surveys in its quarterly assessment of the economic outlook, using it as a benchmark for the health of the recruitment market. Tombs cautioned that the REC survey had proved to be “too gloomy in signalling declining employment” over recent months compared with official employment data from the Office for National Statistics, which has shown permanent staff numbers edging up. Tombs said: “The survey is based on recruiters, not firms, so it isn’t registering the recent trend for businesses to hoard labour, due to fears they may not easily be able to replace them further ahead.” A separate survey of employers by S&amp;P Global showed that they were still adding to their workforces in August, though only modestly. “We think the reality lies somewhere in between the REC and S&amp;P surveys, and that employment likely will flatline in the second half of this year. Neil Carberry, REC chief executive, said: “August is always a slower month for new permanent roles, but this has been exacerbated in 2023 by the lack of confidence to start the new hiring we saw among firms in the Spring. “As inflation begins to drop, it is likely that firms will return to the market later in the year – employer surveys suggest confidence may be returning. But for now, the labour market has more slack than it has since the heights of the first lockdown. Firms continue to use temps to fill any short-run needs, with the small drop in August representing little change from the past few months.” The latest bulletin from the ONS showed employment and job vacancies were down, while unemployment and redundancies were up. Elsewhere in the energy world, European gas prices have jumped after some Australian energy workers began a strike. The month-ahead price of European natural gas is up 15% this morning, to €35.35 per megawatt hour, the highest since Monday. UK month-ahead gas contracts are up 9.5% at 87p per therm. The jump came after liquefied natural gas workers working at Chevron sites in Australia began partial strikes today, after talks failed to reach an agreement in a dispute over pay and conditions. The Chevron units, at Gorgon and Wheatstone, produced about 7% of global LNG supply in 2022 according to Bloomberg. The renewables auction outcome is a major setback to the acceleration of green energy in the UK, warns Simon Virley CB, Vice Chair and Head of Energy and Natural Resources at KPMG: “The lack of new offshore wind projects in the UK Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions is a major setback at a critical time when we should be looking to accelerate renewables. After record breaking rounds in previous auctions, this is the first time since CfDs launched in 2015 that there have been no new offshore wind projects announced and will call in to question the Government’s target of 50GW by 2030 and the ambition to get to a Net Zero power system by 2035. Virley adds that the government must urgently review the parameters of its auction ahead of the next round of bidding, to recognise the need for higher guaranteed prices for offshore wind: “This outcome reflects the growing inflationary and supply chain pressures affecting the offshore wind sector in recent years, which is making it harder to deliver these projects at the strike prices and other auction parameters set by the Government. The Government will need to review urgently these parameters ahead of Auction Round 6, if it wants the British success story on offshore wind to continue.” RenewableUK, the trade associaion for the renewable energy industry, is calling for urgent action to restore investor confidence, after offshore energy developers shunned the UK’s renewables auction. They warn that today’s clean power auction risks undermining targets to boost energy security and could also jeopardise the industrial opportunities of offshore wind. RenewableUK explains that the results of the 5th round of Contracts for Difference (CfD), published this morning, show that 3.7 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity was successful overall. That’s the lowest level since 2017 – and just over a third of the 10.8GW in last year’s auction. With no offshore wind developers taking part in this year’s auction, future auctions will now have to support 4.5-5.8GW a year to get the UK on track to hit the Government’s 50GW offshore wind target for 2030 RenewableUK CEO Dan McGrail says today’s results are “a major blow for consumers”: “Industry has warned that rising costs should have been properly priced into this auction. If the UK isn’t offering prices that allow investors to make a return, they will simply invest elsewhere. These results should set alarm bells ringing in Government, as the UK’s energy security and net zero goals can only be met if we have offshore wind as the backbone of our future energy system. We need the Government to show that the UK is open for business. The failure to secure any new offshore wind is a major blow for consumers that could, and should, have been averted. Building wind farms means we stabilise the cost of energy for the long-term and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels, prices of which can be manipulated by dictators and despots. It’s not too late to get back on track, but without urgent changes, we risk pricing ourselves out of the global race for clean energy investment. Renewables don’t only enable us to fight climate change, they also help to drive economic growth, creating jobs and supporting supply chains across the UK. This result for offshore wind means putting economic growth on hold, with over £10bn in investment and thousands of jobs delayed. Chris Hayes, senior data analyst at think tank Common Wealth, argues that it makes more sense to make direct public investment on renewable energy projects, rather than guaranteeing prices to private firms. Following this morning’s auction, Hayes says: “The failure of this allocation round relative to initial expectations is testament to the limits of de-risking private investment as a route to mass buildout of renewables. This regime subordinates our future energy system to private capital returns of a size and certainty that can only be secured at a great expense to the public, especially in this new climate of economic turbulence. Direct public investment could deliver this at a lower cost and with less operational vulnerability to changing circumstances.” Newsnight’s economics editor, Ben Chu, has analysed today’s renewables auction: Investment bank Jefferies says today’s renewables auction highlights the need for “a more joined-up approach between industry and government” to progress offshore wind development in the UK. It is “simply mind blowing” that the UK government has failed to attract a single bid for new offshore wind projects, says Alethea Warrington, senior campaigner at climate charity Possible. This negligence will lock us into reliance on dirty, expensive gas power for even longer. It is incredibly disappointing that, once again, the government has failed to seize the opportunity to sufficiently increase the UK’s supply of clean, cheap renewable energy. “After a summer of record-breaking global heatwaves and as we face another winter of unaffordable energy bills, people across the UK will be unable to understand why the government is unwilling or unable to get on with the job of getting the UK off expensive, polluting gas with wind and solar power. The amount of new renewable energy which is being permitted to come through via the Contracts for Difference auctions is just far too small, and leaves us reliant on polluting, unaffordable power. Billpayers and our climate will pay the price for this poor policy-making by the government. “The government must update the Contracts for Difference price caps to allow a new generation of renewable energy to power this country, bring down bills and slash our emissions.” Seven tidal stream projects, which harness the power of the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun using floating or sea-bed mounted turbines, have secured contracts in the UK Government’s latest renewable auction. They will generate an extra 53MW of tidal stream capacity by 2028. Here’s the details: Scotland SAE Renewables, secured 21.94MW of capacity (Pentland Firth, MeyGen) Orbital Marine Power, secured 7.2MW (Orkney, EMEC) Magallanes secured 1.5MW (Orkney, EMEC) Wales Hydrowing secured 10MW (Ynni’r Lleaud) Verdant secured 4.9MW (Anglesey, Morlais) MOR Energy secured 4.5MW (Anglesey, Morlais) Magallanes secured 3MW (Anglesey, Morlais) Richard Arnold, policy director of the Marine Energy Council, says: “This is a fantastic day for the industry and proof that with the right support tidal stream energy can play a key role in the UK’s future energy mix.” “Successive support in renewable auctions could deliver over 100MW deployed in the UK by 2028. This will see more tidal stream projects in UK waters than the rest of the world combined. The Government’s failure to recognise the impacts of inflation in supply chains could cost billpayers £1bn a year in lost savings from offshore wind, the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) says. Jess Ralston, Energy Analyst at the ECIU, explains: “The renewables that were secured at this auction are still lots cheaper - a third for some technologies - than wholesale power prices which are set by gas. “But the elephant in the room is the renewables that weren’t secured. We’ve potentially missed out on bill savings worth over £1bn from no offshore wind bids, which again would be far cheaper than the alternative gas. That’s bad news for households, the industry and the Government - not a good look for outdated Treasury rules to be blocking cheaper bills ahead of the next Election. “The industry says our offshore wind market, the second largest in the world, is ready to deliver. Will the government rerun this auction with sensible strike prices” The Contracts for Difference framework (which guarantees a minimum price for energy) must be “urgently reformed” following today’s CFD auction results, argues Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of UK union Prospect. Ferns says “These results are a disaster for the UK’s offshore wind industry. “Businesses and workers stand ready to deliver a rapid rollout of renewables but the government’s failure to set sustainable prices is holding the industry back. “This is the latest sign that the government has given up on bringing down bills, creating clean energy jobs, and meeting its climate targets. “The Contracts for Difference framework must be urgently reformed if we are to have any hope of decarbonising the energy system and delivering good jobs in the process.” Sam Richards, founder and campaign director of Britain Remade, says the government was complacent and incompetent for failing to heed industry warnings that the cost of offshore wind turbines had jumped sharply: “The failure to award a single contract for offshore wind in the latest round is the direct result of the Government’s complacency and incompetence in the rules they set for the latest auction. This catastrophic outcome will cost hard-pressed billpayers £1bn a year. “Ever since the Contracts for Difference system was introduced in 2014 industry has driven down costs at every single auction round – to the point that, for a time, offshore wind farms were 9 times cheaper than new gas plants. Yet because of the war in Ukraine the costs of core materials used in offshore turbines such as steel, aluminium and copper have skyrocketed, as they have for businesses across the economy. Despite this, Ministers and mandarins decided to ignore warnings from the industry that this would mean, for a short time, the cost of offshore wind would rise - while still being significantly cheaper than new gas plants. “By capping the price the sector could bid at too low, Government set it at a level that made it impossible for investors to meet their costs. This will condemn consumers to higher bills than necessary and means Britain loses out on vital jobs and billions in investment. “At the same time as the Government capping the price at an unrealistic level, ministers have also failed to deliver the necessary planning reforms that will speed up delivery and cuts costs. It cannot be right that it takes up to 13-years to build an offshore wind farm, when construction takes only 2 years.” The failure of the UK government’s auction for offshore wind to attract any bids is the latest sign of trouble in an industry that’s crucial to meeting net zero goals. So says Bloomberg’s energy correspondent, Javier Blas, who explains: Only 3.7 gigawatts of fresh projects cleared in the government’s fifth auction round for new renewables, marking a huge drop from the almost 11 gigawatts that were given contracts in last year’s allocation round. The main reason for the huge fall in new capacity was the lack of offshore wind, which is facing rising financing and supply chain costs. Greenpeace says today’s “failed renewables auction” is the biggest disaster for clean energy in almost a decade, and will put the UK’s decarbonisation target in jeopardy. Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said: “This monumental failure is the biggest disaster for clean energy in almost a decade. Thanks to cost pressures and inept government policy, this auction round has completely flopped - denying bill payers access to cheap, clean energy and putting the UK’s legally binding target of decarbonising power by 2035 in greater jeopardy. It leaves the UK more dependent on expensive, imported fossil gas. “Offshore wind is one of the cheapest and cleanest forms of power there is, but in an effort to save consumers pennies on their energy bills, the government is costing them pounds. We need urgent reforms to the way these contracts are awarded and smart changes in government policy to unlock private investment and remove planning bottlenecks. If they don’t, the new renewables - which are essential for lowering bills, increasing energy security and slashing emissions - simply won’t get built.” There is concern and disappointment in Wales over what the offshore wind auction flop means for Erebus, the planned floating windfarm off Pembrokeshire, my colleague Steven Morris reports. Plaid Cymru’s environment spokesperson in Westminster, Ben Lake, said: “Today’s news is deeply disappointing. The Erebus project is the first of its kind in Wales, and would have paved the way for further offshore wind developments, helped to lower energy bills, and make an important contribution to the economy of southwest Wales. “Despite repeated warnings from the industry, the UK government failed to factor rising costs into the auction process, making this flagship project less competitive. The Irish government, on the other hand, ran their auction in May with a framework that recognised current supply chain costs and secured investment in four offshore wind farms. Wales is losing to Ireland due to the UK government’s poor planning.” The director of RenewableUK Cymru, Jess Hooper, said: “As Wales’ first floating offshore wind project, Erebus is entirely dependent on this form of revenue support to succeed, and the success of Erebus is critically important not only to Wales and the wider south west region, but also for the UK government’s own floating offshore wind targets. This result will now delay investment decisions for developers, supply chain companies, ports and infrastructure, all with knock-on effects.” ScottishPower, which operates several offshore wind projects off the UK coast, has revealed it did not submit any bids to the contract-for-difference (CfD) support scheme. Keith Anderson, ScottishPower CEO, says today’s auction results is “a multi-billion pound lost opportunity” to deliver low-cost energy for consumers, and also “a wake-up call for Government”. Anderson adds: “The CfD process is recognised globally as a lynchpin of the UK’s offshore success, but it also needs to flex to keep pace with the world around it. We all want the same thing – to get more secure, low-cost green offshore wind built in our waters. ScottishPower is in the business of building windfarms and our track record is second to none in terms of getting projects over the line when others haven’t been able to. But the economics simply did not stand up this time around. “We need to get back on track and consider how we unlock the billions of investment in what is still one of the cheapest ways to generate power and meet the UK’s long-term offshore wind ambitions for the future.” Ed Miliband is now telling Radio 4’s Today Programme that today’s news is an “absolute disaster for Britain”, and an “absolute condemnation of the government’s energy policy”. He adds: They are trashing the crown jewels of our energy system, and it was all totally avoidable. Miliband explains that failing to increase the guaranteed price for offshore wind projects, to recognise increased costs, was a “totally self-defeating false economy”; it will mean the UK uses more imported gas instead. The Labour party say the news that no offshore wind projects were successful in the Government’s latest auction for renewables support is an “energy security disaster”. Ed Miliband MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, says ministers failed to heed warnings that the guaranteed price offered for electricity by the government was too low. “The news this morning is an energy security disaster and a £1 billion Tory bombshell that will push bills up for hardworking families. The Conservatives have now trashed the industry that was meant to be the crown jewels of the British energy system - blocking the cheap, clean, homegrown power we need. “Ministers were warned time and again that this would happen, but they did not listen. They simply don’t understand how to deliver the green sprint, and Rishi Sunak’s government is too weak and divided to deliver the clean power Britain needs. “This is just the latest episode in the Tories’ 13 years of failed energy policy: they broke the onshore wind market, they undermined the solar industry, and they caused chaos with botched home insulation. Every family and business are paying the price for these failures in higher energy bills, and our country remains exposed. “Only Labour can get Britain building and deliver the clean energy we need to cut bills and make the UK energy secure, with our plan for clean power by 2030.” Despite today’s failure to award support to any offshore wind projects, the government says a “record number of renewables projects” have been awarded Government funding today. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says 95 new projects have been awarded funding from its renewables scheme. They will deliver 3.7GW of clean homegrown energy, enough to power the equivalent of two million homes. That include onshore wind, solar, and tidal, they say, “helping to grow the economy and increase UK energy security”. Energy and Climate Change Minister Graham Stuart said: “We are delighted that our first annual Contracts for Difference auction has seen a record number of successful projects across solar, onshore wind, tidal power and, for the first time, geo-thermal. But what about the failure to award any contracts to offshore wind? Stuart says the government will ‘work with industry’, to hit its offshore wind goals: “Offshore wind is central to our ambitions to decarbonise our electricity supply and our ambition to build 50GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, including up to 5GW of floating wind, remains firm. The UK installed 300 new turbines last year and we will work with industry to make sure we retain our global leadership in this vital technology. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero says inflation, and supply chain problems, led to no contracts being awarded to offshore wind contracts this morning: While offshore and floating offshore wind do not feature in this year’s allocation, this is in line with similar results in countries including Germany and Spain, as a result of the global rise in inflation and the impact on supply chains which presented challenges for projects participating in this round. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Britain’s clean energy ambitions have been dealt a painful blow this morning, as a subsidy auction to support new renewable energy projects awarded no contracts for offshore wind projects. Critics are calling the flop the biggest clean energy policy failure in almost a decade. So what went wrong with the UK’s flagship renewables scheme? Industry insiders say ministers failed to heed warnings that they had set the auction prices too low, failing to adjust for the soaring costs faced by renewable energy developers when they build offshore wind. The auction uses a mechanism known as contracts for difference, which guarantee consumers will pay a fixed price for the energy generated by the bidder. When wholesale prices are lower, subsidies added to customer bills top up the difference; when wholesale prices are higher, developers backpay the difference. That fixed cost, though, appears to have been set too low to attract bids, meaning the government’s target of reaching 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 could be in jeopardy. Contracts have been awarded for onshore wind, solar, geothermal and tidal stream projects, data released by the government shows. But the failure to award offshore contracts will damage Rishi Sunak’s plans to meet climate targets and drive down energy bills, just as the prime minister flies to India for the G20 leaders summit. My colleague Jillian Ambrose reports: Nearly all the biggest offshore wind developers in the UK were forced to sit out of the bidding after ministers refused to increase the maximum price for the auction, despite a 40% increase in the cost of manufacturing and installing turbines due to inflation. The government’s failure to secure more than one/two offshore wind farms was described by Greenpeace as “the biggest disaster for clean energy policy in the last eight years” because it risks jeopardising the UK’s plan to triple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030, and casts doubt on Britain’s climate targets. Renewable energy developers submitted sealed bids in the auction in the first half of August; the most competitive proposals were then ranked, with contracts awarded to projects offering the lowest cost to energy-bill payers. But there had already been warnings that firms would need to receive higher maximum prices, after rising costs forced Vattenfall to cease working on the multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm.

He (played by Conleth Hill) is a respected member of the community who runs his late father’s successful electrical superstore. He has been married to Diane (Rosie Cavaliero) for 25 years, has a son and a daughter who are no trouble and they all live in a large, immaculate new-build with a pillared porch in a nayce part of town. The only downside – apart from his decidedly unnayce father-in-law Dougie (George Costigan on fine, if unhygienic, form) – is that the business was more successful when his father was running it and Martin is in hock to local villains, the Slater brothers, for an amount that keeps getting further and further out of his reach. So it unfortunately becomes time to end things with Kath (Sian Gibson, also the series’ co-writer, with Paul Coleman), his mistress of 25 years, to avoid paying her rent on the flat above the abandoned butcher’s shop in which he had generously installed her when times were good. Thus – with a twist in the final scene – is the machinery of the series set in motion. Disaster heaps upon disaster (Diane of course finds out about his infidelity), convolution upon convolution and the whole thing presumably culminates in the fire at the superstore with which the first episode opens – before the overarching narrative flashes back to three days before. At first it seems as if The Power of Parker is going to do what a lot of comedy dramas do. It feels destined to fall with a barely audible splat between its two genres – not funny enough with the comedy and not cohesive or compelling enough with the drama. The first episode has a lot of sub-Victoria Wood lines (“How’s the diabetes? “All right.” “You still can’t have KitKats?”) and relies heavily on 90s references instead of actual jokes (“Bez’s mum once bought a twin tub off me”). And the story holds few surprises (unless you count the final twist, which I suspect most viewers will see coming). It is further weakened by the unjustified borderline viciousness of Martin as he breaks up with Kath, which makes the audience recoil rather than invest. But things improve as the series goes on – the set-ups feel a little less strenuous, the edges rub off and the plot and characters all run a little smoother. If none of it will ever set the world alight, the jokes get a little better and the developing relationship between Diane and Kath alongside their backstories becomes something you want to stay with. There are also nice contributions from both ends of the age and experience spectrum, from the glorious Sheila Reid as residential home guest Gladys – who encourages too-soft-for-her-own-good Kath to stand up for herself after Martin gives her the heave-ho – to relative newcomer Rhiannon Clements. She plays mouthy, pill-popping (usually extracted from her patients’ allowances) care home assistant Bev – a stock character, but Clements gives it a great spin and her timing is immaculate (if you’re hovering, I’d at least stick around for the dick pic joke in episode two). The same goes for Abby Vicky-Russell as Martin’s barely adequate assistant Julie, another character we’ve seen many times before but here – with Vicky-Russell leaning more heavily and successfully into the Victoria Wood vibe – very much worth another run out. The Power of Parker remains underpowered overall, but it has enough about it – along with a good way with a cliffhanger – to get you through. The Power of Parker aired on BBC One and is available on BBC iPlayer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2023/jul/28/why-is-the-drc-wasting-precious-resources-on-an-outdated-testament-to-french-colonial-power","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-28T13:15:55Z","webTitle":"Why is the DRC wasting precious resources on an outdated testament to French colonial power? | Vava Tampa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/28/why-is-the-drc-wasting-precious-resources-on-an-outdated-testament-to-french-colonial-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/jul/28/why-is-the-drc-wasting-precious-resources-on-an-outdated-testament-to-french-colonial-power","fields":{"bodyText":"With a joyous rumba-filled opening ceremony, the 10 days of Le Jeux de la Francophonie begin on Friday in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Staged every four years since 1989, and aimed at people aged 18 to 35 from French-speaking countries, the games include photography, dance and painting alongside weightlifting, running and cycling. It is presented as a utopian vision of a world where the French language is shared and not imposed – a fiction too many go along with. At a time when many are trying to tear down Francafrique, as Haiti is pressing the case for reparations for the slave trade, and in the aftermath of the CFA Franc scandal, why are we celebrating so-called common values with the nation that once exploited us so badly? Le Jeux de la Francophonie is meant to help shape our national sense of ourselves. The DRC – the world’s largest French-speaking country – is at war with the neighbouring French-speaking regime in Rwanda. The French, as well as Britain and the US, have continued to support Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, in spite of overwhelming evidence of Kigali’s involvement in crimes against humanity in DRC over the past 20 years, and Rwanda’s support for the Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23) militia, which has committed mass killings and rape and displaced more than 900,000 people from their homes. Rwanda has not been thrown out of Francophonie – a loose group of French-speaking countries that seems to be just a thinly veiled attempt by France to keep a political hold on its former colonies – and Paris continues to refuse to push for the international criminal court to issue arrest warrants for Kagame. The games were switched to Kinshasa after New Brunswick in Canada pulled out, citing costs that grew 664% to C$130m (£76m). They will be the fifth games to be organised on the African continent. Only two have been held in France and none in Belgium or Luxembourg – which have sizeable French-speaking populations. Because of Covid, the 2021 games were rescheduled to 2022 and then deferred until this year because DRC didn’t have the infrastructure to host the event. “It is tough to get the resources to organise such events when you are a nation at war,” the DRC foreign minister, Christophe Lutundula, conceded last week. The Congolese government is said to have ploughed about US$30m (£23m) into staging the games, which will feature at least eight sports and 12 cultural events, involving 4,000 participants including top athletes from about 40 countries. Organisers hope the event will reach a global television audience of many millions. Once the usual legacy promises about urban regeneration and sports participation are stripped away, though, are the games not an outdated waste of resources for a struggling country? What value does Francophonie have unless part of a genuine attempt to reckon with France’s subjugation and exploitation of black people and their land, and continued support of Africa’s strongmen such as Kagame? Coined by the 19th-century French geographer and colonialist Onésime Reclus, the word Francophonie was the grand vision of the French colonial expansion. In his 1883 work, France, Algérie et Colonies, Reclus argued that France should concentrate on colonising Africa – a continent rich in natural resources, and where the overwhelming majority of the French-speaking population live today. Reclus did such a good job of talking up French colonisation that at the end of the Berlin Conference in 1885, France took the largest slice of “the magnificent African cake”. In fact, until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, France was the only former colonial power that maintained and expanded its reach in Africa. Nearly half of African countries were at one time French colonies or protectorates. As athletes from 40 Francophonie nations compete on track and field in the coming days, Congolese people are dying as a result of the fighting in DRC that couldn’t have continued to the extent it has done since 1998 without, in part, France’s actions. DRC should have left Francophonie years ago, and cancelled the games in protest. • Vava Tampa is a freelance writer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/jun/17/bettye-lavette-lavette-review-more-heart-on-sleeve-power-from-the-soul-veteran-randall-bramlett","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-17T15:00:17Z","webTitle":"Bettye LaVette: LaVette! review – more heart-on-sleeve power from the soul veteran ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/17/bettye-lavette-lavette-review-more-heart-on-sleeve-power-from-the-soul-veteran-randall-bramlett","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jun/17/bettye-lavette-lavette-review-more-heart-on-sleeve-power-from-the-soul-veteran-randall-bramlett","fields":{"bodyText":"While still a teenager, Bettye LaVette left an indelible mark on 1960s soul music with a slinky brace of singles (My Man, He’s a Lovin’ Man and Let Me Down Easy), after which she seemed destined to become a two-hit wonder, especially after her label, Atlantic, sidelined an expensive, dazzling 1972 album, Child of the Seventies.

But it has been rebranded, apparently. The event, taking place in Aberdeen on 30 March, will no longer share a name with the California pop-punk band; ministers are understood to have plumped for the less lyrical “energy security day”. But climate campaigners fear it looks set to be, to quote Green Day’s 2004 hit, a Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Energy secretary Grant Shapps and chancellor Jeremy Hunt have come under pressure from industry to produce a meaningful response to US president Joe Biden’s $369bn in climate subsidies, granted through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has seen major companies reallocate investment to the US. The pair will also be hoping to seize the initiative from Labour, which has made the switch to green energy a key battleground. Shapps and his newly formed Department for Energy and Net Zero certainly have a mandate to shake up a crucial industry. As the energy crisis has escalated over the past 18 months, it has exposed flaws across the sector – from tariffs and decarbonisation concerns to the link between wholesale gas and electricity prices. But the Guardian has revealed that the presentation will contain measures to please the fossil fuel industry, from new offshore drilling plans to a refusal to force oil and gas companies to stop flaring by 2025 – as recommended by Chris Skidmore in his net zero review. It may even give a licence to the huge, and so far undeveloped, Rosebank oil and gas field off Shetland. It is understood that Ofgem will not, as had been mooted, be given powers to include the net zero target in its regulation of the energy sector, and that the only measure aimed at improving Britain’s energy efficiency will be a consultation on improving insulation in the private rental sector. On the renewables side, there are concerns Britain’s prowess in offshore wind could be rapidly eroded if Biden’s IRA subsidy tempts investment away from the UK to the US. A windfall tax on some electricity generators has not helped investor confidence. Meanwhile, green campaigners hope Shapps will confirm a lifting of the effective ban on onshore wind developments, amid concerns it will persist. Industries expected to get particular attention in the presentation are nuclear, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Hunt made great fanfare of nuclear at this month’s budget, aiming to reclassify the technology as “sustainable” so as to attract environment-conscious investors, and kicking off a competition for small modular reactor (SMR) designs. However, it is unclear whether the reclassification will help in the hunt for co-investors alongside EDF and government in the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. And industry insiders say the SMR competition has merely delayed the decision on which projects to fund. The chancellor also announced £20bn of spending on carbon capture and storage projects over 20 years, with a promise to get “spades in the ground” from next year. The technology captures the CO2 emitted by big polluters and stores it underground. Backers of the projects hope Thursday will provide answers on which proposals will receive approval. Last week, power station owner Drax said it had paused investment in carbon capture until the government decides whether it will offer financial support. Hunt’s £20bn has been labelled a PR exercise and a “dangerous gamble” on unproven technology, as the £1bn-a-year spending primarily falls outside this parliament. Onlookers also hope to see firmer plans on supporting the green hydrogen industry – seen as important to decarbonising heavy industry – electric batteries and storage facilities, vehicles and the supply of critical minerals into that sector. Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband is not getting his hopes up. He criticised the Conservatives’ “low ambition and chronic underfunding of green projects”, and added that Labour plans to create a “publicly owned national champion in clean power generation, and deliver a million good green jobs”. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “This is the best opportunity for the government to stop us being left behind in the global race on green growth … [it] must put the budding UK industries of renewable energy, electric vehicles, batteries and green steel at the heart of the UK’s economic plan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T22:33:33Z","webTitle":"Iran pledges to restore monitoring equipment at nuclear sites, says IAEA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/iran-pledges-to-restore-monitoring-equipment-at-nuclear-sites-says-iaea","fields":{"bodyText":"Iran has pledged to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday. Restoration of the cameras is among assurances reportedly given to the UN nuclear agency that Tehran will finally assist an investigation into uranium particles found at undeclared sites, it said. The breakthrough came as the watchdog’s director general, Rafael Grossi, who earlier met the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Tehran, returned to Vienna and said that some of the monitoring activities that were not operating would be restored. A joint statement from the IAEA and Iran said: “Iran expressed its readiness to … provide further information and access to address the outstanding safeguards issues.” The statement did not go into detail on the extent of the assurances but the possibility of improved relations between the UN body and Iran is likely to ward off fresh calls from western countries for Iran to cooperate, diplomats said. Iran has made similar promises before that have yielded little or nothing. The country is supposed to provide access to information, locations and people, Grossi said after returning from Iran before a meeting of the IAEA’s board of governors. Iran would also allow reinstallation of extra monitoring equipment that had been put in place under the 2015 nuclear deal, but was removed last year. The visit to Iran came shortly after the IAEA reported that uranium particles enriched up to 83.7% had been found at an underground nuclear site. Fears are growing that Iran has accelerated enrichment but Grossi said the Iranians had agreed to boost inspections at the facility by 50%. He also confirmed the agency’s findings that there has not been any “production or accumulation” of uranium at the higher enrichment level. Nonproliferation experts say Tehran has no civilian use for uranium enriched to even 60%. A stockpile of material enriched to 90%, the level needed for weapons, could quickly be used to produce an atomic bomb, if Iran chooses. The 2015 nuclear deal with world powers limited Tehran’s uranium stockpile and capped enrichment at 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. It also barred nuclear enrichment at Fordo, which was built deep inside a mountain to withstand attacks from the air. The US unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018, reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, which then began openly breaching the deal’s restrictions. The IAEA has accused Iran of stonewalling its investigation into traces of processed uranium found at three undeclared sites. Its board of governors censured Iran twice last year for failing to fully cooperate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/sep/01/tv-keir-starmer-tory-labour-bbc-drama-our-friends-in-the-north","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-01T15:58:52Z","webTitle":"Corruption, policing, poverty: the TV show that could teach Keir Starmer a lot about being bold | Jonathan Freedland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/01/tv-keir-starmer-tory-labour-bbc-drama-our-friends-in-the-north","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/01/tv-keir-starmer-tory-labour-bbc-drama-our-friends-in-the-north","fields":{"bodyText":"Here’s a suggestion for how Keir Starmer might use this final weekend of the summer recess before politics resumes in earnest on Monday. He should settle into his favourite spot on the sofa and dive into a TV masterpiece that could not be more topical – one produced for the moment when a Tory government is dying and a new, Labour one is waiting to be born. It sets out with brilliant clarity the range of problems that awaits the Labour leader should he reach Downing Street – housing, policing, poverty, crime, inequality – and grapples with the eternal dilemma of the left: is change best secured through radicalism, inspirational and impatient, or pragmatism, cautious and gradual? All that in nine gripping episodes. Timely though it is, the series is not new. Nor will you find it by searching the documentary or current affairs categories, even though it’s hard to think of a TV programme that sheds more light on British politics or the country’s recent history. Instead, it is a drama first aired nearly three decades ago, one whose force and relevance have, if anything, only grown stronger. I’m talking about Our Friends in the North by Peter Flannery, which debuted on BBC Two in 1996 and which I watched, and marvelled at, all over again this summer. It’s an epic tale told across three decades, following four characters born and raised on Tyneside – Nicky, Mary, Geordie and Tosker, impeccably played by Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee, Daniel Craig and Mark Strong – from early adulthood in 1964 through to middle age in 1995. We follow their lives and their loves, their mistakes, heartbreaks and disappointments, as they try to shape, and are shaped by, the events of the age. The fifth character is the Labour party. It rules Newcastle, determining the homes the four will live in, or eventually abandon, and turns and twists through their stories, pitting father against son, husband against wife. Two of the four, at different points, will either seek or win office wearing a red rosette. One reason the show lives on – so that people who haven’t seen it since the mid-1990s still talk about the plight of the quartet as if discussing their own friends – is that the characters are not political ciphers, there solely to represent ideological positions, but complex, flawed people who exist in three dimensions. What’s more, the series is preoccupied with some enduringly human themes, central among them the often destructive legacy one generation bequeaths to another, especially when the relationship between a man and his son goes badly wrong. And that story is timeless. But there’s something else that explains why Our Friends in the North has not dated. Even the supposed history, 30 years in the past when the show was made and 60 years ago now, is current, even urgent. Take one narrative thread that runs throughout: the corruption of the Metropolitan police. In an early episode we see a room in Scotland Yard filled with detectives getting drunk and watching pornography. The scene depicts the vice squad in the 1960s, but given what we now know of Met culture it could just as easily refer to today. Later a supposedly reforming commissioner says he’s cracking down on corrupt officers; in fact, he either pensions them off or moves them to other forces. On Thursday the government effectively conceded that even police found guilty of gross misconduct can currently remain in uniform, promising new powers of automatic dismissal – powers that most voters would surely assume were already in place. No less striking is what the show has to say about the places where we live. It is a tribute to the genius of Our Friends in the North that it makes municipal housing policy the stuff of riveting drama, with a key storyline based on the real-life scandal involving the former leader of Newcastle city council, T Dan Smith, and the architect John Poulson. A charismatic local Labour leader promises to clear the slums and replace them with “streets in the sky” – cheap, high-rise blocks that will eventually prove damp, rotten and uninhabitable. In the show, the looming towers become a symbol of how a single political decision can wreck lives: to watch it now is to think immediately of the 100 or more schools made of crumbling concrete or of Grenfell on 14 June 2017. “That was a terrible night, watching that and thinking, ‘Christ, nothing changes,’” Flannery told me when we spoke this week. There are several such moments, when the drama provides not just insight but foresight. The entrepreneur and proto-Thatcherite Tosker wants to move from being a slum landlord to a financier, offering loans to would-be homeowners who can’t actually afford a mortgage: made in 1996, Our Friends in the North anticipates the sub-prime crisis that would trigger the financial crash 12 years later. No less uncanny, there is a pre-run of the “bigoted woman” episode that blighted Gordon Brown’s 2010 campaign, when a Labour campaigner confronts a voter who, in front of the cameras, chides him for allowing unwelcome outsiders to become her neighbours. It’s all there: dementia, mental illness, inherited trauma – issues that are discussed often and openly now, but which were new ground then. And threaded throughout is what feels like the perennial Labour dilemma: go bold and risk defeat, or tread cautiously and risk failure. “It is perennial,” says Flannery. “It’s certainly repetitive.” Now aged 71, the writer has lived through the cycle three times. He can recall Harold Wilson taking over as Labour leader, just as “another zombie Tory government was failing”. And yet Labour was cautious, waiting. “They always seem to be waiting for the Tories to fuck it up; they never seem to be on the front foot.” He had the same thought again in 1996, when the show was first broadcast, in the dog days of the John Major administration. He’d heard Tony and Cherie Blair were watching it, so he wrote to the Labour leader, urging him to take advantage of the landslide that was clearly coming his way and be bolder. (Flannery doesn’t know if the letter ever reached Blair, but he got no reply.) And he sees the same story unfolding now, the familiar fearfulness exhibited in the current Labour leadership: this week the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, ruled out a wealth tax. Flannery understands Labour’s nervousness, the legacy of serial defeat. He accepts that Labour radicalism gets punished when the Conservatives are strong, but insists that such timidity makes little sense when the Tories are weak – as they are today. If Flannery is right, we are now in one of those all-too-rare periods – they come around perhaps only once every 30 years – when Labour is on the verge of power and can afford to be brave. Alternatively, you may think there’s a middle way, like the one staked out in a new essay by two Labour policy veterans suggesting a Labour government “will need to move at great pace while crafting a message of patience”. Our Friends in the North does not offer a definitive answer: it’s a compelling human drama, not a position paper. It’ll only be on BBC iPlayer for a fortnight or so longer. Keir Starmer should watch it before it disappears and resolve that, this time, the larger, political story it tells – of Labour hope and disappointment – might just follow a new script.

At his first press conference on his return from Tehran on Saturday, Rafael Grossi said “yes” when asked if Iran had pledged to restore all the cameras and other surveillance equipment that it had removed from its nuclear-related sites. But at Monday’s press conference he qualified this, saying it required further discussion. He said there was no agreement at this point on Iran handing over older footage and data taken by cameras and other equipment at the nuclear-related sites, or on future provision of that footage and data. “There are certain things we need to clarify,” he said. Grossi’s visit to Tehran came ahead of a meeting of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency this week to discuss a possible further censure of Iran for failure to cooperate with inspectors. If the IAEA board passes a highly critical resolution, Iran might again respond by increasing levels of uranium enrichment and stockpiles that are already far in excess of the limits set in the nuclear deal of 2015. It could also destroy some of the camera footage it has been storing at nuclear sites but not handing to the UN inspectors, a move that would further damage the IAEA’s continuity of knowledge about the nuclear programme. Grossi, a highly experienced Argentinian diplomat, has extracted Iranian promises before to restore the inspectors’ previous level of access that European powers and the US feel were not delivered, so in a context of minimal trust the west will want to examine how precise and bankable are the latest set of voluntary commitments that Iran offered Grossi in Tehran. A concern is that Tehran is making vague promises to carry it over the hurdle of the IAEA board meeting. On the other hand, the US, preoccupied with Ukraine, appears not to be in a mood to censure Iran over its nuclear programme or to try to restore the stalled nuclear deal. At his press conference, Grossi dismissed public statements by Iranian officials that they would not give him access to key Iranian nuclear scientists, implying that behind the scenes they are sending him different messages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-11T16:45:58Z","webTitle":"UK power prices hit record high amid cold snap and lack of wind power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/11/uk-power-prices-hit-record-high-amid-cold-snap-and-lack-of-wind-power","fields":{"bodyText":"UK power prices have hit record levels as an icy cold snap and a fall in supplies of electricity generated by wind power have combined to push up wholesale costs. The day-ahead price for power for delivery on Monday reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange. The price for power at 5-6pm, typically around the time of peak power demand each day, passed an all-time high of £2,586 a megawatt-hour. Prices are surging as the weather forces Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy, despite high bills. Snow and ice have caused disruption as the cold weather looks set to continue into this week, with snow forecast for parts of east and south-east England, as well as Scotland. The cold snap, which is expected to last for at least a week, comes as wind speeds reduced sharply, hitting power suppliers. Live data from the National Grid’s Electricity System Operator showed that wind power was providing just 3% of Great Britain’s electricity generation on Sunday. Gas-fired power stations provided 59%, while nuclear power and electricity imports both accounted for about 15%. The increase in power prices come amid jitters over energy supplies this winter. National Grid warned in October that a combination of factors such as a cold spell and a shortage of gas in Europe related to the war in Ukraine could lead to power cuts in the UK. The anticipated surge in power demand on Monday evening will coincide with a planned use of the National Grid’s demand flexibility service between 5pm and 7pm. The scheme pays businesses and households to cut their consumption at peak times to reduce the strain on the grid. The scheme has been used several times as part of a series of tests but is yet to be used as a result of electricity supply shortages. National Grid flirted with using it under these circumstances last month but did not do so. Dr Agostinho Moreira de Sousa, a consultant in public health medicine at UK Health Security Agency, encouraged those with health conditions to heat their homes to a comfortable temperature. “In rooms you mostly use such as the living room or bedroom, try to heat them to at least 18C if you can. Keep your bedroom windows closed at night. Wearing several layers of clothing will keep you warmer than one thicker layer,” he said. German day-ahead power prices rose 33% to €434 (£373) a megawatt-hour, the highest since 13 September, while the French contract rose 40% to €465 a megawatt-hour, Bloomberg reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T07:00:43Z","webTitle":"Brands embrace Eurovision - and the spending power of its 180m viewers ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/08/brands-embrace-eurovision-and-the-spending-power-of-its-180m-viewers","fields":{"bodyText":"The wind machines have been tested, dance routines perfected and wardrobe malfunctions eliminated. At this stage, there is not much you can do about the singing or the song choice. So as one pageant in Britain ends, another begins, with the Eurovision song contest semi-finals kicking off in Liverpool on Tuesday. Whether you consider it a cringeworthy affair or the World Cup of music, it is one of the most-watched shows on the planet, with 180 million people expected to tune in. Viewers may watch expecting to hear some cheesy songs but these days the sponsors are big cheeses, too – including the cream cheese maker Philadelphia – as the business world embraces Eurovision’s inclusive message and the spending might of that huge fanbase. When tickets for the final sold out in about half an hour, fans joked they would “live on Philadelphia” in an attempt to win the VIP tickets up for grabs on limited-edition packs. When you think about it, the marriage of Philadelphia and “Europe’s cheesiest song contest” is the stuff of Don Draper. This year, the Christmas favourite Baileys also wants to be on your radar if you are planning a “Eurosoiree”. The brand has inked a three-year deal with Eurovision and enlisted the 2014 winner, Conchita Wurst, as a brand ambassador. Paul Carton, Baileys’ global marketing director, said it wanted to be part of the “world’s most joyful global celebration of inclusive and diverse cultures and communities”. The deal means the Austrian drag queen can be found shaking Baileys cocktails on its social media channels. While these tie-ups appear as frivolous as last year’s Norwegian entry – Subwoolfer’s Give That Wolf a Banana – more well-known brands want to be part of the spectacle and have more opportunity to do so. While going out on the BBC means “nul points” for advertisers in the UK, the contest now airs on Eurovision’s own YouTube channel. It is also livestreamed on TikTok. With a week to go, #Eurovision2023 has already garnered more than 1bn video views on the app. Dr Paul Jordan, an expert on the contest who is known as Dr Eurovision, says sponsorship has been part of Eurovision for a long time, with its presence sometimes causing headaches for the BBC. “It used to be difficult to attract large, mainstream sponsors but now this doesn’t appear to be such a challenge,” said Jordan, who suggested this was down to a “renewed appreciation of the contest. It also embodies the values of a lot of people, particularly the younger generation. “Social media is a big part of the attractiveness for brands,” he added. “Songs have gone on to become viral hits thanks to TikTok. Armenia’s entry last year came 20th on the night, yet went on to become a huge hit online – probably the most successful ever in terms of streams and downloads.” The competition is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is an alliance of public services broadcasters. It is a co-production between the host broadcaster and other participating outlets who pay a fee to take part. Sponsorship revenue helps offset the costs of the event. This year’s partners include the beauty brand Moroccanoil, the travel site Booking.com, TikTok, Baileys, and Mondelēz, the US food group behind Philadelphia. The BBC’s national sponsors include easyJet and Google. An EBU spokesperson said the contest’s huge global reach and values of “inclusiveness, diversity and universality” made the event popular with brands. Liverpool is hoping that staging Eurovision will bring a £40m boost for the city. With songs interspersed with awkward travel clips, easyJet’s pitch that it offers “more seats between the UK and Eurovision countries than any other airline” also makes sense. Joe Cuffaro, the head of PR and marketing at the communications agency WSA, said: “Eurovision acts as a bit of tourism ad for the host country, as well as the other entrants. Then, for brands like Baileys, there is all the partying that goes on. I think the fact it does not take itself too seriously is part of the mass appeal.” Finally, don’t forget Invivo X Unity if you are settling down to watch. No, it is not the Italian entry, it’s the “official prosecco of the Eurovision song contest”. With a bottle design that aims to “inspire more unity around the world” this exclusive £12 fizz can only be found at Ocado and, yes, there is a rosé version, too."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-23T14:00:53Z","webTitle":"Greens attack Albanese government’s ‘deeply unsettling’ secrecy on submarine nuclear waste plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/24/greens-attack-albanese-governments-deeply-unsettling-secrecy-on-submarine-nuclear-waste-plans","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor and the Coalition have been accused of taking a “deeply unsettling approach” to transparency around Aukus after the major parties blocked the publication of documents about nuclear safety and waste issues. The government cited national security concerns when it rejected a Senate order to produce documents, including those about options to manage operational waste from the nuclear-powered submarine program. The move comes just months after the Radiation Health and Safety Advisory Council warned against allowing a cloak of national security to “mask inadequate radiation safety protection of the Australian public, weaken regulatory authority, or inhibit transparency on matters of Australian public safety”. David Shoebridge, a Greens senator and defence spokesperson, said the council was “the very agency entrusted to protect Australians from radiation and ensure nuclear safety and security, yet the government is already ignoring its advice”. “The hiding of information at this early stage signals a deeply unsettling approach to future regulation, transparency and oversight of these nuclear submarines,” Shoebridge said. His motion had sought a range of documents reviewed by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) working group, including the safeguards required for a nuclear-powered submarine program. It also sought information about the “characterisation, classification and acceptance of risks in a nuclear environment” and any minutes of meetings held with the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce on these topics. But Anthony Chisholm, a Labor frontbencher said disclosing such material would be “contrary to Australia’s national interests”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It may be prejudicial to the security or defence of the commonwealth, and could prejudice international relations as well,” he said. The Coalition joined with Labor to defeat the motion in the Senate this week. The former independent senator and submariner Rex Patrick said the blocking of the motion “shows the shallowness of thinking behind both major parties as to the need for complete transparency around this important issue”. “This Aukus program has been orchestrated in total secrecy such that the government and Defence could get to a point of announcing a fait accompli without any debate or resistance,” Patrick said. “There are some things that should properly be kept secret around a submarine – but these things should not include nuclear stewardship, nuclear regulation, nuclear safety or how to deal with operational waste and spent fuel.” Patrick has, however, used freedom of information laws to obtain some other documents from Ansto and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa). These include minutes of an Ansto board meeting on 9 February showing the agency will seek government funding of $34.5m over the next four years because it faces increased workload “as a direct result of a nuclear-powered submarine program”. Ansto is also concerned about the risk of a “loss of workforce” to other taskforces and regulators as the Aukus project ramps up. It expects “increased frequency of requests for radiological monitoring” coinciding with an increase in visits to Australia by US and UK nuclear-powered submarines. A nuclear emergency response exercise was held in Hobart on Thursday. Guardian Australia understands this was the latest in a long series of “tabletop” exercises that aim to ensure government agencies can support nuclear-powered warship visits. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, said Australia must become “responsible nuclear stewards”. “This will mean developing the full suite of skills, facilities and institutions along with an appropriate regulatory and legislative architecture to be nuclear stewards,” he said. The government has promised to establish “a new dedicated executive agency responsible for delivering the optimal pathway for Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine program”, while also setting up a new independent regulator. Within 12 months the government would “set out the process” to identify current or future defence land that could be used for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, Marles said. “I want to assure the parliament that there will be appropriate public consultation, particularly with First Nations communities to respect and protect cultural heritage,” he said. In the latest sign of misgivings within Labor, a party branch in the electorate of the prime minster, Anthony Albanese, passed a motion calling on his government to “withdraw from the Aukus alliance and cease any program in pursuit of the acquisition of nuclear submarines”. Party members at the Enmore branch meeting this week agreed that Labor should prioritise spending that contributes to the “social good of our society rather than wasting hundreds of billions of dollars on a dangerous and unnecessary weapons program”. According to a copy that has been widely circulated within NSW Labor, including to a large number of branch secretaries, the motion argued Aukus was “not in the interests of the Australian people” and “could take us into an unnecessary and devastating war”. The motion reflects concerns within elements of the party’s rank-and-file membership, but does not yet indicate a groundswell that could stop the deal. The federal Labor caucus is largely united behind the Aukus agreement unveiled last week by the prime minister, even though some MPs have asked questions. The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, vowed to allay concerns about the multi-decade plans. “This is the most significant industrial endeavour this country has ever attempted,” Conroy said. “That is why we need to give people confidence we have a plan and have thought through how to deliver it.” The Petersham branch – also within Albanese’s electorate – passed an anti-Aukus motion in late February, before the San Diego announcement. Labor members are also mobilising against the possibility of Port Kembla being selected as a future base for nuclear-powered submarines. Some members are understood to have been emboldened to register their concerns, after several prominent Labor figures including the former prime minister Paul Keating spoke out against Aukus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-12T18:06:08Z","webTitle":"Biden dangles $6bn investment if Northern Ireland power sharing agreed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/12/joe-biden-us-investment-northern-ireland-power-sharing","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden has dangled a $6bn (£5bn) carrot in front of Northern Ireland’s leaders with a promise to boost the country’s economy with US investment if power sharing is restored. In a thinly veiled message to the Democratic Unionist party, which has been boycotting the devolved government for more than a year, the US president told an audience in Belfast that American investors were ready to “triple” the $2bn already invested. “The simple truth is that peace and economic opportunity go together,” Biden said. He reminded representatives of the region’s five biggest parties, who sat at the front of the auditorium, of how transformative the Good Friday agreement had been 25 years ago and urged them to put the past behind them and look at the prosperity that could flow in the next quarter of a century. In the past 25 years, the gross domestic product of Northern Ireland had doubled, while in “just the past decade” almost $2bn in US investment had gone into the economy, he said. “I predict to you if things continue to move in the right direction, [it] will more than triple,” he said. “There are scores of major American corporations wanting to come here, wanting to invest. “It is up to us to keep this going, keep going in the work that has been done every day for the last 25 years.” The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed Biden’s visit but said it “doesn’t change the political dynamic in Northern Ireland”. He said: “I had a brief conversation with the president, and he made clear that it’s not his job, as we heard in his speech, to take decisions for political leaders in Northern Ireland. “But the United States stands ready to support Northern Ireland in whatever way it can. So I welcome his visit here today – it’s good to see the president coming and we hope to see investment into Northern Ireland flowing from his efforts and those of his special envoy.” Speaking at Ulster University in Belfast, Biden – citing the cyber and tech industries, green energy and young entrepreneurs – said the opportunities for Northern Ireland to lift itself into becoming a major part of the UK economy were “incredible”. He urged political leaders to “sustain the peace”, promising it would “unleash this incredible economic opportunity”. Biden’s special economic envoy for Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy III, would be heading a trade delegation to the region “maybe later this year” to “supercharge” a new wave of investment, Biden promised. He urged the DUP to return to power-sharing arrangements at Stormont and said an “effective devolved government … is going to draw even greater opportunity in this region”. Kennedy later told reporters that US corporations always sought stability as a prerequisite for investment. Biden said: “I hope the assembly and the executive will soon be restored.” Cautious not to be seen as interfering, he quickly added: “That is a judgment for you to make, not me, but I hope it happens.” He told the audience that he was part-English by birth but he swerved commentary over any alleged pro-nationalist bias. Donaldson was seen beaming while having convivial chats with Kennedy and later on an informal walkabout with Biden. He said restoration of power sharing would only happen if the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, took steps to remove the remaining Brexit barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Sunak missed Biden’s speech in order to visit a senior PSNI officer who was shot in Northern Ireland earlier this year. Sunak is understood to have met DCI John Caldwell and his family at a hospital in the north-west. The PSNI described it as a “private visit” and would not comment. Earlier, one of Biden’s senior aides was forced to deny that the president was “anti-British” after accusations by the former DUP leader Arlene Foster that the US president “hates the UK”. The party’s chief whip, Sammy Wilson, when asked about Biden’s visit, said his party would “not be bought”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme, the MP for East Antrim said: “On one hand, he [Biden] says he’s here to help the peace process and the Good Friday agreement; on the other hand he has done his best to undermine the Good Friday agreement and its institutions, and indeed his backing of the EU against the UK government, trying to force [the] UK government into a corner to accept EU interference in Northern Ireland, has not helped the process and has led to the collapse of the institutions.” The atmosphere at Ulster University was reverent and jovial, with the president working the room and posing for selfies and handshakes with party leaders after his speech. Doug Beattie, the head of the Ulster Unionist party, and Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP, said Biden had spoken to them about the economic opportunities in their private conversations, underlining the message from the US. Time was also set aside for the Northern Irish actor James Martin, who became the first person with Down’s syndrome to have the leading role in an Oscar-winning movie, after starring in the short film An Irish Goodbye."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/29/metoo-men-power-abusers-schoolchildren-culture-sexual-aggression","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-29T16:44:44Z","webTitle":"#MeToo has got men quaking in the corridors of power.

Daniel Korski, favourite to be selected as Tory candidate for London mayor, has withdrawn from the race after an allegation of groping. He denies it, while his accuser, Daisy Goodwin, a screenwriter and producer, says other women have contacted her with some “very interesting stories” about him. #MeToo appears to have struck again. Men in apparently unassailable positions of power have been toppled in a quite extraordinary sequence of scandals. Masters of the universe everywhere must be trembling at what might emerge about all they have done, taking it for granted that women at work were there to be touched, or subject to “banter”, all with an unspoken shadow of threats to careers. Junior women have taken great risks to unmask bosses who can command their future. Those women usually experience a torrent of online and mainstream abuse for their bravery, with vicious accusations from “you brought it on yourself” to “gold-digger”. I look on, deeply impressed at their courage, as each new feminist wave pushes forward frontiers beyond what my generation dared. With friends of my age, we look back on what we should never have tolerated when I started out, in the fabled revolutionary year of 1968. We were the original snowflakes, who wouldn’t have contemplated going to an editor with tales of molesting or harassment. Such tales would probably have been greeted with astonished incomprehension, probably even ridicule. Sisterly solidarity was confined to warning one another, not urging each other to publicly complain. Yet plainly some women still think this behaviour is more or less OK, or even normal. Writing in the Mail about the Korski case, Sarah Vine claimed that a fellow guest once manhandled her breasts at a No 10 party, “reaching out, grabbing them in both hands and sort of jiggling them around with a vigorous enthusiasm that, I must confess, rather took me and everyone else by surprise”. Her response? “I wasn’t particularly upset – after all, he did it in full view of everyone, so it wasn’t threatening or sinister. But it did rather take the wind out of my sails. In the end, I decided to file it under ‘someone having a bit of fun at my expense’.” On Korski, she was forgiving: “If Korski did what Goodwin alleges, then he made a stupid mistake. But should that be the end of him? Unless concrete evidence emerges of more incidents in a similar vein, no. There is not yet, nor do I hope there will ever be, a law against flirting, larking around – or simply just being a damn fool.” (You might wonder if she’d be so forgiving of a Labour politician.) More to the point, that “boys will be boys” attitude has run its course. Behind every unwanted grope is a men-in-charge worldview that lets every little boy or girl know their rightful place. #MeToo has been a bold surge forward. As with any campaign, it’s vital that we trumpet the successes, even while acknowledging the Himalayas still left to climb. It kicked off with Harvey Weinstein, emperor of Miramax, receiving a 23-year sentence for rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse he committed, unchecked, over a period of 30 years (he received an additional 16-year sentence this February). After all those years of silence, 80 women, many of whom had been gagged by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), came forward with accusations after the remarkable bravery of his PA, Zelda Perkins. Later came the fall of Jeffrey Epstein. This month’s remarkable Icarus is Crispin Odey, a hedge funder holding $4.4bn in assets, after a dogged investigation unearthed stories from 13 women in an “abusive workplace”. The accusations against Odey, a big-time Brexit funder, were shockingly graphic. His fund collapsed in days as investors fled. The fund’s executive committee had tried before to rein him in; he fired them. And who would expect a handful of brave junior women could cause the mighty CBI to all but implode under accusations of sexual harassment? Initial reporting led to a cascade of more than a dozen women coming forward with accounts, including rape. What finally brought Boris Johnson down was his cavalier promotion of Chris Pincher, ignoring the warnings of sexual misconduct against him. Other sectors, including the media, have also been shaken by such cases. “Pestminster” scandals continue to multiply, as MP David Warburton resigns after being suspended over allegations of sexual harassment. These are only a few examples of the #MeToo earthquake that has set thousands of senior men shaking in their big boots. This widespread fear is the campaign’s deep success, the sign of a culture that is beginning to shift. Finally, the abuse of women, whether sexist banter or violent rape, is threatening the great citadels of power. Upon departing the Commons, Warburton, who denies harassment, acidly claimed that #MeToo had “swung too far”. The backlash is of course ferocious, as ever. When I spoke to Jess Phillips, Labour MP and women’s rights campaigner, she was coming out of a meeting with Weinstein’s denouncer, Perkins. They had discussed the campaign against the NDAs that gagged Perkins for 25 years, and still silence abused women. So far, one province in Canada has banned them, and Ireland is heading the same way. The freedom of speech bill here has a Labour amendment barring universities from using NDAs to silence victims. But she says, of parliament: “People will still be elected next time who think they can get away with abusing this power imbalance in the workplace.” Are we nearly there yet? Some things are getting worse, says Laura Bates, whose Everyday Sexism site has collected a quarter of a million stories of abuse and harassment. She lists its successes, from cultural influence to “catharsis, hope and solidarity for hundreds of thousands of survivors”. Yet she recounts little sign of schools tackling sexual assaults. About two-thirds of girls in the UK have reported experiencing unwanted sexual attention, including touching, in public places and thousands of cases of sexual assault have recently been reported in schools. Yet teachers are still not given adequate training about how to counter the extreme brand of Andrew Tate-influenced misogyny that spreads online, and sex education is under attack from the right. Meanwhile in workplaces the women who are most defenceless are those on zero-hour and precarious contracts. There is an Everest to climb still, but what happens at the top ricochets all the way down to the school classroom. Toppling the mightiest abusers matters. The feminist revolution is barely half made. But we should celebrate each ratchet upwards by every new wave of women.

Carlos Acosta’s Havana-based company was always intended to be many things: a proudly Cuban outfit that could hold its own on the European touring circuit; a group of dancers comfortable in every style from ballet to hip-hop to Cuban dance styles; and a choice of international choreographers who aren’t just the same old names. In all that, Acosta Danza succeeds, and it’s always a pleasure to watch these dancers, even if the rep tonight doesn’t set the stage on fire. They have a clear passion for performance, great energy and presence; all very different bodies, but increasingly familiar faces. Raúl Reinoso and Mario Sergio Elías, who have been with the company since it began in 2016 , both have strong solo moments, and the striking Zeleidy Crespo arrives in Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Faun like the tall stem of an elegant bloom, strongly rooted even when the choreography buffets her body in every direction. Faun is an impishly magical duet made in 2009 (inspired by Nijinsky’s L’Après-midi d’un Faune) and it has proved to have a long life, taking on new inflections with each set of dancers. Its strength choreographically is in taking just one idea and one movement lexicon and fully exploring it, and that focus pays off where other works might be more roving and ultimately less satisfying. Not that there isn’t plenty to enjoy and engage with elsewhere. Up and coming American choreographer Micaela Taylor gets every muscle in her dancers’ bodies moving in Performance, hitting each quaver beat with inventive ideas. Spanish choreographer Juanjo Arqués tries to give us a picture of Cuba beyond the cliche in Portal, showing a community bound in percussive grooves but also solo dancers in handheld spotlight, under slightly sinister scrutiny. And there are slick jazz-inspired moves, set to spoken word (a translation would have been helpful), in Goyo Montero’s Alrededor No Hay Nada, which has an element of vaudeville and considers power dynamics.

I was there to interview the 23-year-old singer for the Face magazine about the making of her imminent second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got. Its title, Sinéad was keen to point out, reflected a newfound calmness and serenity following what had been a turbulent few years following the release of her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, in 1987. She was, she said, no longer “this desperately unhappy and fucked-up person” who had been “bolshy and aggressive to everyone”. Instead, the new songs were “prayerful – not literally, but insofar as they give off a religious feeling – spiritual happiness”. By the time my feature was published as a cover story in February 1990, her second single from that album, Nothing Compares 2 U, had become a worldwide hit, transforming her life and utterly disrupting that short-lived serenity. The fame it brought in its wake was, for Sinéad, akin to an emotional tidal wave: unmooring and almost capsizing. She fought against it as if fighting for her life. She was, she would later say, a protest singer, not a pop star. There was a sliver of truth in that, but her mercurial temperament defied labelling. As many have noted in the wake of her passing, she walked her own singular creative path, sometimes stumbling, sometimes falling, always defiantly and wilfully out of step, uncompromising and intent on telling it as she saw whatever the cost. She became a kind of outsider artist, answerable to no one but herself – fuelled by her beliefs, fascinations and commitments. After that initial encounter, and before her long self-imposed exile from pop stardom, I became friends with Sinéad for a time in the 1990s, our paths crossing at house parties, in bars, at gigs. I remember her as a breath of fresh air: uplifting, unaffected, often hilariously unguarded in her opinions of her contemporaries and peers, and seemingly unaware of her beauty or her extraordinary presence, both of which held everyone around her in their sway. In 1992, I had a blessedly brief second career as a co-director of pop promo videos, teaming up with my friend Seamus McGarvey, who has since gone on to become a renowned cinematographer (The Hours, Atonement, We Need to Talk About Kevin). Our first video was for the Bristol-Irish rap crew Marxman, who were as ideologically committed as their name suggests. It was banned by the BBC, earning us some credibility if little cash. When I was given a rough cut of their proposed second single, Ship Ahoy, a broadside against colonialism set to a thunderous beat, I called Sinéad to tell her about it, sensing that she would have an affinity with both the music – she was a huge fan of hip-hop – and the sentiment. That evening, Seamus and I sat with Sinéad in his beat-up Citroën on a rainy west London street and played it to her at full volume on the car stereo. She immediately asked us to play it again, bobbing her head and smiling. Seizing the moment, I asked her if she would sing the song’s short chorus when they recorded it properly in a few weeks. She agreed without hesitation. It’s fair to say her presence transformed the song and, more dramatically, the video, which she also graced with her presence. Seamus shot her performance at Bray studios where, her wrists wreathed in chains for added symbolism, she seemed to inhabit the song’s plaintive refrain – “Lord, take me where I lie,/ Don’t let my children die.” There was one dissonant moment during the shoot. Sinead had hung around, chatting and watching intently, while we dropped various emblems of colonialism – flags, miniature ships and statues – into a huge water tank, filming them as they sank slowly to the bottom. During a break for coffee, she beckoned me to one side, looking suddenly serious. “How come you don’t have a Vatican flag?” she asked. It soon became clear this was an issue for her, so much so that we dispatched a runner to try and find one at short notice in a flag emporium in central London. Whether he succeeded or not I cannot remember, but the decision to seek one out seemed to assuage Sinéad, who departed soon after, hugging everyone involved in the shoot. It was, in retrospect, a prescient interlude. A few weeks later, on 3 October 1992, Sinéad made headlines across the world when she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during a performance of Bob Marley’s War on NBC’s Saturday Night Live, intoning the words: “We have confidence in the victory of good over evil” and exhorting viewers to “fight the real enemy”. As a provocation, it was both spectacular and self-sabotaging, brave and, to many, foolhardy. In a few seconds, she capsized her fame and unmoored herself from pop stardom, riding out a fierce backlash from American fans and the media. I wondered then, as I do now, what the psychic cost of her rebelliousness was, and where its roots really lay. Sinéad was not so much a political artist as someone instinctively and righteously committed to speaking out against injustice. Her assault on a Catholic hierarchy at that time committed to denial over the extent of child abuse by its clergy is now seen as an extraordinarily brave and dramatic (early) breach of its collusive silence. I met Sinéad many times afterwards, including one memorable night when she cajoled me and some friends to attend the opening of a shortlived Irish bookshop in Westbourne Park. A handful of people were treated to an impromptu acapella performance of several darkly mysterious traditional Irish folk songs, which she sang while sitting crosslegged on the floor. It was transfixing in its effortlessness and its emotion. Pure Sinéad. In 2002, we met and talked in some depth about her recent ordination to the Catholic priesthood. Like Sinéad the anti-pop star, Mother Bernadette Marie O’Connor was serene and sincere, but also mischievous and provocative. Her relationship with the Holy Spirit, she explained, had been there since childhood “and it is everything to me in my life”. A few minutes later, though, she confessed that she considered herself “more Rasta than Catholic.” She was drawn, she explained, to the positive elements of both to underpin her belief in the essential goodness of humanity. “You don’t have to obey all the rules,” she said, smiling. “I never did.” And she never would. The last time I saw Sinéad was in January 2018, when our paths crossed again at Shane MacGowan’s 60th birthday concert in Dublin, where she stole the show with an effortless rendition of his song You’re the One. She seemed in good spirits, if distracted, and I wish now I had talked to her for longer. I’ve thought of every one of those almost ordinary times with Sinéad a lot in the last few days. One of the many problems with fame – and more so with media notoriety – is its distorting aspect. You can lose sight of the person you once knew, so much so that you start thinking: “Did I really know them at all?” Death amplifies that sense of distortion. So it is that her journey of creative brilliance and personal struggle, deep wonder and constant rebellion, and latterly aloneness and personal tragedy – has been condensed in obituaries into a narrative from which, it seems to me, she seems somehow missing or misrepresented. Her unruly contours of rebel life just did not fit that detached and formal format. It is, above all, the testimonies of ordinary people – and most affectingly the women, young and old, who picked up on the felt intensity of her righteous anger and her empathy – that attest to how much she was loved and will be missed. Since her death, a line from an old Simon and Garfunkel song keeps playing in my head: “Preserve your memories, they’re all that’s left you … ” I tend to them now, and Sinéad is, for a few moments at least, alive and well, and as free-spirited, engaging and effortlessly unpredictable as anyone I’ve ever known."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-01T00:02:37Z","webTitle":"Royal Navy orders investigation into nuclear submarine ‘repaired with glue’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/01/royal-navy-orders-investigation-into-nuclear-submarine-repaired-with-glue","fields":{"bodyText":"The Royal Navy has ordered an urgent investigation amid claims that workers on a Trident nuclear armed submarine fixed broken bolts in the vessel’s reactor chamber using glue. The faulty repairs on the cooling pipes aboard HMS Vanguard were found after one of the bolts fell off during an inspection, the Sun reported. The bolt heads originally came off due to over-tightening. But, rather than replacing the damaged shafts, staff at the defence contractor Babcock implemented a quick fix and glued them back on. Engineers at the contractor reported it as a procedural glitch after the problem was found, but did not mention the botched nature of the repair. A navy source told the newspaper: “It’s a disgrace. You can’t cut corners with nuclear. Standards are standards. Nuclear standards are never compromised.” The glued bolts held insulation in place on the coolant pipes in the nuclear reactor and were found just as workers were set to fire it up to full power for the first time, the newspaper reported. Investigators will trawl records of repairs to find out when the bodged work occurred and who was ultimately responsible. The Ministry of Defence spokesperson said that a “defect” was found on HMS Vanguard when in dry dock and that it was “promptly reported and fixed”. The spokesperson said the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, met the chief executive of Babcock, David Lockwood, “to seek assurances about future work”. Babcock is the MoD’s second-largest contractor and has multibillion pound contracts to maintain the navy’s Astute and Vanguard sub fleets. A spokesperson for the company said: “Any quality-related issue is a huge disappointment, but our own robust inspection processes discovered the issue. There was no safety or operational impact from the work.” The Guardian reported in December last year of safety fears as the submarines had been deployed at sea for record-breaking periods of five months each. Rob Forsyth, who helped command Polaris nuclear submarines in the 1970s, said the lengthy patrol times could lead to “boredom, complacency and an inevitable drop-off in standards”. HMS Vanguard is one of four nuclear submarines that form part of the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent. The vessels are always out on patrol and are poised to strike in the unlikely event that Britain is hit with a nuclear attack. An MoD spokesperson said: “As part of a planned inspection, a defect was found from work done in the past when HMS Vanguard was in dry dock. It was promptly reported and fixed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-12T15:58:20Z","webTitle":"Women’s World Cup 2023 power rankings: breaking the finalists down","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/apr/12/womens-world-cup-2023-power-rankings-all-32-finalists","fields":{"bodyText":"1) England The European champions’ momentum suffered a blow when defeat to Australia ended their 30-game unbeaten run. In contrast, they also added the Finalissima to their ever-expanding trophy cabinet this window. The Lionesses are still favourites with time to fix any problems. 2) USA It feels wrong to knock the back-to-back world champions off the top spot. They are still a force but defeats to Spain, England and Germany at the tail end of 2022 showed there is work to do. That may already be in progress as they are unbeaten this year. 3) Germany Defeat against Brazil will have surprised many, but Germany undoubtedly remain on track. Victory over the Netherlands showed their ability. The injury Alexandra Popp picked up in Nuremberg is a worry. 4) France New-look France, with controversial manager Corinne Diacre gone and Hervé Renard in, seem happier. A resilient recovery against Colombia in Renard’s first game was followed by a 2-1 defeat of the Olympic champions, Canada. 5) Australia Australia finished their overseas tour with optimism. Despite losing to Scotland, they then beat the European champions England. Their reliance on Sam Kerr staying fit could be a concern. But with their captain, the Matildas possess plenty of potential. 6) Spain Despite missing 15 key players after a falling out with the federation over conditions, Spain just keep winning. Wins against Norway and China came in this window. They could be formidable if the impasse with the players is resolved in time. 7) Canada How Canada will look this summer remains unanswered. A pay dispute and injuries have taken their toll. That they lost narrowly to France shows the character of the Olympic champions can not be discounted. 8) Brazil Brazil are without Marta, Debinha and Ludmila, but only narrowly lost to England on penalties in the Finalissima and earned a shock 2-1 defeat of Germany. A team growing in confidence with each positive result. 9) Sweden Peter Gerhardsson’s side are clearly not the team they once were. A loss to Denmark and a dramatic six-goal draw with Norway will be seen as a setback in their preparations. 10) Denmark Back-to-back wins against top-10 nations Sweden and Japan without influential forward Pernille Harder is no mean feat and a turnaround from defeats to Australia and the Netherlands to finish 2022. 11) Japan Defeat to Denmark will have not been on the cards for the 2011 World Cup champions. That loss followed a 2-1 victory over Portugal. Struggling for consistency against the top sides. 12) Netherlands The Dutch are still trying to find the answers to life without Vivianne Miedema. A comfortable win over Poland will have built confidence, but defeat to Germany showed they might struggle against the best. 13) Norway Came from behind twice against Sweden to earn a 3-3 draw after a 4-2 defeat to Spain in this window. Influential striker Ada Hegerberg leaving the pitch looking uncomfortable so soon after her return from injury will be a concern. 14) China Defeat to Spain illustrated how much China need to improve, but they are capable of shutting out an attack. England will need to be wary when they meet in Group D. 15) Italy Have lost their way a little since an impressive showing at their first World Cup in 10 years in 2019. A 2-1 defeat of Colombia was the team’s only fixture in this window. 16) South Korea Colin Bell’s side put 10 past Zambia in two matches in this window. They possess quality in attack, but struggled against stronger opposition at the Arnold Clark Cup in February. 17) Portugal A 2-1 defeat to Japan and draw with Wales rounds off the World Cup debutants international break. Before that they were unbeaten in eight months, with wins over Iceland, Haiti, Costa Rica, New Zealand and Cameroon. 18) Republic of Ireland Ireland’s unbeaten run ended with two narrow defeats to the USA. The performances more than the results, however, showed that Vera Pauw’s side are not to be dismissed. 19) Argentina After a heavy loss to Spain at the end of 2022, Argentina have beaten World Cup co-host New Zealand twice and earned a draw and win over Venezuela in this window. 20) Switzerland Switzerland have struggled to get their World Cup campaign going. They have slumped to three draws and a defeat this year, with a 0-0 draw with China and 2-1 loss to Iceland coming in this international break. 21) Colombia Colombia lost to rance and Italy but the displays showed they can compete. Their form is strong and they were only beaten narrowly by Brazil in last year’s Copa América final. 22) Nigeria Nigeria rounded off a successful international window with a comfortable victory over New Zealand. They had previously beaten Haiti 2-1. After a disappointing Africa Cup of Nations, their progress is clear. 23) New Zealand The co-hosts are on a dire run of form. New Zealand have not won in nine games, with losses to the USA, Portugal, Argentina and, most recently, Nigeria. 24) Jamaica Conceded nine and scored twice in defeats to Spain, Czech Republic and Australia at the friendly Cup of Nations in February. The team has one win in seven games. 25) South Africa Banyana Banyana have struggled since winning a first Africa Cup of Nations title in 2022. A 3-2 defeat to Serbia concluded this window. 26) Costa Rica Costa Rica endured a tough window with a heavy defeat to Scotland and narrow loss to Poland. Two wins against the Philippines last year showed they can compete with those around them. 27) Philippines Yet to be tested against top-level opposition. They cruised to wins over Pakistan and Tajikistan in their quest for Olympic qualification. Suffered narrow defeats to Scotland and Wales in February. 28) Vietnam One of the emerging nations in Asian football. Their focus, however, has been elsewhere this window with Olympic 2024 qualifying. They beat Nepal twice to progress before their World Cup debut. 29) Morocco Another World Cup debutant, Morocco suffered back-to-back defeats to Czech Republic and Romania in this window. That was added to a draw and defeat to the Republic of Ireland in November. 30) Haiti Yet another debutant, Haiti qualified through the intercontinental playoff this year. A narrow defeat to Nigeria showed promise. They possess one of the most exciting young players in Melchie Dumornay, who will join Lyon this summer. 31) Zambia Zambia enjoyed a standout 2022, defying the odds to finish third at the Africa Cup of Nations and win the Cosafa Championship. They suffered two heavy defeats to South Korea in this window and are, as yet, untested against top opposition. 32) Panama Panama beat the Dominican Republic twice in this break.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls. There were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopol’s air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning. The basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day. The Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover. The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols. Earlier in the week, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”, saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity. Petro Kotin, Energoatom’s president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces. “They have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,” Kotin told the Guardian. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. “You can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there aren’t any Ukrainian forces that close,” Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile. “My personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: “You see – we’re protecting you and it’s the Ukrainians who are shelling you.” It was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlov’s accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant. The IAEA inspectors on site could theoretically determine the trajectory of incoming rockets or shells but such detective work is not within their mandate. The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to. Meanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow. “In some cases, there’s only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,” Orlov said. “People don’t have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.” Operating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscow’s control. “They take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,” Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts. In recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further. Melynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar. But keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown. If the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours. “Those remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,” Melynchuk said. “Even without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/us-scientists-confirm-major-breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T16:59:09Z","webTitle":"US scientists confirm ‘major breakthrough’ in nuclear fusion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/us-scientists-confirm-major-breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/us-scientists-confirm-major-breakthrough-in-nuclear-fusion","fields":{"bodyText":"Scientists have confirmed a major breakthrough has been made that could pave the way for abundant clean energy in the future after more than half a century of research into nuclear fusion. Researchers at the US National Ignition Facility in California said fusion experiments had released more energy than was pumped in by the lab’s enormous, high-powered lasers, a landmark achievement known as ignition or energy gain. The technology is far from ready to turn into viable power plants – and is not about to solve the climate crisis – but scientists hailed the breakthrough as evidence that the power of the stars can be harnessed on Earth. Dr Arati Prabhakar, the policy director at the White House Office of Science and Technology, said: “Last week … they shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers going in. This is such a tremendous example of what perseverance really can achieve.” Fusion energy raises the prospect of plentiful clean power: the reactions release no greenhouse gases nor radioactive waste by-products. A single kilogram of fusion fuel, which is made up of heavy forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium, provides as much energy as 10m kilograms of fossil fuel. But it has taken 70 years to reach this point. Speaking at the announcement on Tuesday, Jill Hruby, of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), said the US had “taken the first tentative step towards a clean energy source that could revolutionise the world”. The National Ignition Facility is a vast complex at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San Jose. It was built to perform experiments that recreate, briefly and in miniature, the processes unleashed inside nuclear bombs, enabling the US to maintain its nuclear warheads without the need for nuclear tests. But the experiments are also stepping stones towards clean fusion power. To achieve the reactions, researchers fire up to 192 giant lasers into a centimetre-long gold cylinder called a hohlraum. The intense energy heats the container to more than 3m degrees celcius – hotter than the surface of the sun – and bathes a peppercorn-sized fuel pellet inside in X-rays. The X-rays strip the surface off the pellet and trigger a rocket-like implosion, driving temperatures and pressures to extremes only seen inside stars, giant planets and nuclear detonations. The implosion reaches speeds of 400km per second and causes the deuterium and tritium to fuse. Each fusing pair of hydrogen nuclei produces a lighter helium nucleus, and a burst of energy according to Einstein’s equation E=mc2. Deuterium is easily extracted from seawater, while tritium can be made from lithium which is found in the Earth’s crust. In the latest experiment, researchers pumped in 2.05 megajoules of laser energy and got about 3.15MJ out – a roughly 50% gain and a sign that fusion reactions in the pellet were driving further fusion reactions. “The energy production took less time than it takes light to travel one inch,” said Dr Marvin Adams, at the NNSA. Immense hurdles remain, however, in the quest for fusion power plants. While the pellet released more energy than the lasers put in, the calculation does not include the 300 or so megajoules needed to power up the lasers in the first place. The NIF lasers fire about once a day, but a power plant would need to heat targets 10 times per second. Then there is the cost of the targets. The ones used in the US experiment cost tens of thousands of dollars, but for a viable power plant, they would need to cost pence. Another issue is how to get the energy out as heat. Dr Kim Budil, the director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said with enough investment, a “few decades of research could put us in a position to build a power plant”. A power plant based on alternative technology used at the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire could be ready sooner, she added. “In some senses everything changes; in another, nothing changes,” said Justin Wark, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford and the director of the Oxford Centre for High Energy Density Science. “This result proves what most physicists always believed – fusion in the laboratory is possible. However, the obstacles to be overcome to make anything like a commercial reactor are huge, and must not be underestimated.” He said that asking how long it could take to overcome the challenges was like asking the Wright brothers how long it would take to build a plane to cross the Atlantic just after their maiden flight. “I understand that everyone wants to think of this as being the great solution to the energy crisis. It is not, and whoever says it is with any certainty is misleading. “It is highly unlikely that fusion will impact on a timescale sufficiently short to impact our current climate change crisis, so there must be no let up on our efforts in that regard. “The latest results also show that the basic science works – the laws of physics do not prevent us from achieving the goal – the problems are technical and economic. As Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning atomic physicist once said: ‘Prediction is very difficult, especially when it is about the future.’” Dr Mark Wenman, a reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, called the achievement a “fantastic scientific breakthrough – something we have not achieved in 70 years of trying”. But he said: “Challenges remain of how you can get the energy out of the system, how you can sustain the energy for long enough to be useful, how you scale up that energy and whether the energy can be cheap enough to compete with other sources.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T09:03:43Z","webTitle":"Polls open in Turkish election runoff as Erdoğan hopes to retain power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. In the first round this month, Erdoğan upended expectations and many pollsters’ predictions by coming out ahead with 49.5% of the vote, as his rival took second place with 44.5%. A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdoğan’s coalition won a comfortable majority. A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. “Are we running to the polls tomorrow? Will we cast our votes from the early hours of the morning?” he asked a cheering crowd. Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. After initially focusing on how his candidacy offered voters a chance to reverse the changes introduced by Erdoğan, including promises of a return to parliamentary democracy and messages of social inclusion, Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign pivoted firmly to the right in advance of the runoff. Both candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round. Oğan declared his support for Erdoğan, while the head of the Victory party, Ümit Özdağ, backed Kılıçdaroğlu, claiming he believed the opposition leader was more likely to follow through on his pledge to deport millions of refugees and crack down on immigration. Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. When polled, those who voted for Oğan in the first round said they were more likely to back Erdoğan. “This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. We have never done this before, so we don’t know if the majority of voters will be more interested given that there are now two candidates. This is why it’s not easy to say what we’ll be witnessing. There may be surprises; Kılıçdaroğlu may win, but I agree his chances are not high compared to Erdoğan,” said Evren Balta, a political scientist at Özyeğin University. Many opposition supporters said they were determined to vote despite their candidate heading into the runoff in second place, searching for millions of votes in addition to the support he gained in the first round but with few obvious constituencies in which to find them. When asked what was driving him to vote despite the opposition’s path to victory appearing uncertain, 24-year-old Emre Göral replied with one word and a cautious smile: “Hope.” Erdoğan has focused on assuring voters by raising the minimum wage, providing free natural gas for the month of May and promoting growth in the country’s defence industry under his rule. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival. “Kılıçdaroğlu can’t handle a crisis,” said 34-year-old Shukran Tutem as she arranged T-shirts on a market stall. “If we compare Kılıçdaroğlu and Erdoğan, it’s easy to see that Kılıçdaroğlu wouldn’t bring anything good for this country’s future, but Erdoğan could.” During campaigning, misinformation was frequently deployed by both sides, including Erdoğan’s use of a deepfake video showing banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for Kılıçdaroğlu. After a first round in which the opposition initially claimed victory before accepting Erdoğan was in the lead, many opposition supporters have remained mistrustful of the result, despite the Republican People’s party stating that although it challenged counts in about 2,269 ballot boxes, this would not have changed the overall outcome. Balta said: “I think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high. These two sides are so polarised that whatever their leader, group or supporters say, they have a tendency to believe it.” In an interview with CNN after the first round, Erdoğan said he was confident of victory: “The people will be the kingmaker, and when the people decide, I believe they will stand with those who successfully served the Turkish nation for the past 21 years. In the end, my people will choose stability and competence and they will cast their votes accordingly.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T20:54:20Z","webTitle":"Crises on multiple fronts threaten Benjamin Netanyahu’s grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/09/discord-in-israel-threatens-benjamin-netanyahus-hold-on-power","fields":{"bodyText":"On Friday afternoon, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, found himself standing at the side of a remote road in the vast desert valley that runs the length of the occupied West Bank’s frontier with Jordan. Along with his defence minister, Yoav Galant, Netanyahu was inspecting the scene of a shooting attack earlier in the day that killed British-Israeli sisters Maia and Rina Dee, 20 and 15, and left their 45-year-old mother Lucy fighting for her life. An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) search for the perpetrator is still under way. “For this challenge as well, we are standing united, unified, sure of our righteousness,” Netanyahu said in comments broadcast by Israeli television. “We will act together with total backing for our forces.” Unfortunately for the prime minister, his remarks rang hollow for many Israelis. This week Israel has faced flare-ups in violence on almost every front – East Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon and Syria. The security establishment has also been unnerved by the sudden rapprochement between Saudi Arabia – the region’s geopolitical heavyweight, with whom Israel is seeking warmer ties – and the country’s arch enemy, Iran. As if the intersecting border crises were not enough to deal with, Israel is also undergoing unprecedented upheaval at home sparked by the government’s bitterly contested plan to overhaul the judiciary. Dozens of former senior defence, security and intelligence officials have opposed the proposals weakening the supreme court on the grounds they are anti-democratic. Israel’s crucial military reservists, including almost all of those serving in its most important air force unit, have joined the nationwide protests and said they will refuse to attend for service, setting alarm bells ringing over the reliability of the chain of command and operational capacity. Galant might have been standing by his side as the pair pledged to find the Dee sisters’ killer, but two weeks ago, Netanyahu fired him after he became the first senior government official to voice objections to the judicial changes. Public pressure quickly forced the prime minister to back down, and announce that legislation weakening the supreme court would be postponed until after the Knesset’s Passover recess. But the lingering uncertainty over Galant’s position and the appointment of the inflammatory national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, does not exactly convey strength and stability – particularly now. Leaked Pentagon documents that surfaced on Saturday suggesting the Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, encouraged its staff and the Israeli public to participate in the protest movement, have added to a growing perception among Israel’s many foes that such internal discord represents an opportunity. “I served in the army for decades, and I did not see behaviour as reckless as that of Netanyahu now,” Moshe Ya’alon, a former defence minister and IDF chief of staff, said in an address at a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. “His obsessive plot to overturn Israel’s democracy represents an immediate threat to Israel’s security … Our enemies are watching, and our deterrence is waning.” Despite corruption scandals and a colourful private life, during his previous five stints as prime minister Netanyahu was generally seen as a safe pair of hands when it came to Israel’s security. Now, even among the rightwing public that voted in the current coalition of extremist and ultra-religious parties, dwindling support suggests that image is fading, and the Israeli leader could once again be forced out of office. A total of 69% of voters gave the government a bad grade on its first 100 days in office, according to polling released by Israel’s Channel 12 on Sunday. Hebrew media reported over the weekend that government sources had suggested they would be forced to launch a major military operation in the coming weeks, after the conclusion of the sensitive overlapping Passover and Ramadan holiday period, in order to bolster the coalition’s legitimacy in the eyes of the public. Israel’s current government was elected on a platform promising order and security. So far, they have delivered the exact opposite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:07:46Z","webTitle":"How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","fields":{"bodyText":"The attack of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – has triggered international concern about the safety of the country’s facilities. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy – it has four main power plants, with 15 reactors, generating about half its electricity. On Friday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said artillery fire at the plant could have caused destruction equal to “six Chernobyls”. For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the attack appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. “If there’s going to be a major nuclear incident it’s because something deliberately is being done,” said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. “Surely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesn’t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant – and those at Ukraine’s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine – has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building – Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle – ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants – has been disregarded. “It’s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,” said Scott. “It is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.” Grossi, who says the situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraine’s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these – or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes – could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plant’s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"Lynmouth Road appears unremarkable. It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine,” says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.” The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, Esmé, 12, and George, 10, and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community,” says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that,” says Hilary. There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,” she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. “Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, you’d be over the moon, wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. “If it comes off, I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.” Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary, so I wasn’t that surprised,” he says, “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.” “We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,” says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.” The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising £40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20,000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off,” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project,” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.” “We’re not setting ourselves up as experts,” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof,” says Dan. While the whole street can’t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but I’m not great with heights,” he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking,” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years,” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.” The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. “It used to be full of very long-term residents,” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.” Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension,” he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want, the community spirit,” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.” The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment,” says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically, but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.” “I want to be part of the solution, even if it’s just a small part,” says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy, food, mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.” “It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic,” says Pippa Evans. “To me, it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community, we can make bigger changes than as individual people.” “The energy for what we do is drawn from anger, but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work,” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here, doing all this, if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world, but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.” “I can be really angry,” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think, ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick, it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time, we can’t be paralysed,” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action, and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.” The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet, but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools, including the one their son attends, to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in. “We’re busy behind the scenes, working out how it could become a street-by-street model,” says Hilary. “I hope, after the first wave, when there are people sharing testimonials, others will want to be involved, too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road, with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes. “I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up,” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households, and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate, otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.” The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan, the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening,” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels, the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down, you feel reliant on the government to change things,” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves, we can do things ourselves.” “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Dan. He is on his rooftop with the street – and the geraniums and cats and wheelie bins – spread out two storeys below. “We do have the power to change things.” For all information on the Power Station, go to power.film.

A spokesperson for the publisher Henry Holt told the Associated Press that for his new book, Wolff interviewed “people throughout the Murdoch organisation, including many with direct knowledge of [Rupert] Murdoch and his family”. Murdoch, 92, remains at the head of a rightwing media empire that has reshaped US politics. The Murdochs and Fox News maintained close links to Trump during his rise to power and chaotic presidency but the network took a heavy blow earlier this year, reaching a $787.5m settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over the broadcast of Trump’s lies about electoral fraud in his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden. Other lawsuits continue, including a $2.7bn defamation claim from another voting machines company, Smartmatic. Fallout at Fox has been extensive, its once-dominant prime-time star, Tucker Carlson, among hosts removed from the air. (Fox and Dominion say his removal was not linked to their settlement. Carlson says it was.) On Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported how Fox News has resisted backing Trump in the current Republican primary, now seeming to favour Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old biotech entrepreneur, in a contest Trump leads by vast margins. Murdoch has reportedly tried to persuade the Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, to make a late entry into the race. The Fall will be published on 26 September. On social media on Tuesday, Wolff referred to Moby-Dick by Herman Melville when he said: “My long, white whale, Murdoch obsession finally comes to an end.” He added: “At this very moment, people inside Fox, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and Murdoch HQ in London, are saying to one another, ‘Did you know about this? What’s he got, do you think?’” A Fox News spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wolff, 69, has long been a fixture in New York media but he shot to bestselling fame in January 2018, when the Guardian obtained and published excerpts of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. Trump fumed. Sources, subjects and other reporters and observers questioned the accuracy of Wolff’s sometimes salacious reporting. But two sequels followed, Siege: Trump Under Fire (2019) and Landslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency (2021). Wolff included stories of the relationship between Trump and Murdoch, including, in Landslide, a description of how the media baron reportedly approved the pivotal call of Arizona for Biden in the 2020 presidential race, with a “signature grunt” and a pithy “fuck him”. Wolff’s most recent book was Too Famous: The Rich, the Powerful, the Wishful, the Notorious, the Damned, a collection of profiles of what his publisher called “the major monsters, media whores and vainglorious figures of our time”. On Monday, Wolff announced an October live event in support of his new book, to be hosted by the actor Alec Baldwin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/15/keir-starmer-we-cant-spend-our-way-back-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-15T18:29:08Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer: ‘We can’t win power by spending. We need to reform and create wealth’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/15/keir-starmer-we-cant-spend-our-way-back-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jul/15/keir-starmer-we-cant-spend-our-way-back-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour will only succeed in winning power and rebuilding Britain if it prioritises economic growth, wealth creation and radical reform of public services over reckless spending promises, says Keir Starmer. With four days to go before a crucial set of parliamentary byelections, the Labour leader delivers the most robust defence to date of his strategy for returning his party to power after 13 years, in an exclusive article for the Observer. Starmer takes on, directly, those who say his agenda is dull and uninspiring, insisting that the hard grind of rebuilding economic credibility must come first, as opposed to Labour retreating to its normal “comfort zone” of promising “vast sums of money”. “Taking seriously the foundations of economic responsibility may not set people’s pulses racing,” Starmer writes, “but the new country we can build on top of them will do.” He calls on those on the traditional left to accept that, once in power, economic growth, investment and wealth creation will be the “only show in town” if Labour is to build a prosperous country with strong public services for the long term. “Frankly, the left has to start caring a lot more about growth, about creating wealth, attracting inward investment and kickstarting a spirit of enterprise,” he says. “It is the only show in town for those who dream of a brighter future.” The determination of Starmer and his shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to be seen as economically responsible above all else has caused some on the left to fear they could blow the party’s chance of power and come to be defined by excessive caution, defensiveness and lack of ideas. On Saturday, Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said the union could reduce the amount of money it gave to Labour if the leadership did not back more of its policy priorities, saying “people want something to vote for”. Starmer emphatically rejects such criticisms, insisting that his five key policy missions on growth, clean energy, the NHS, crime and “shattering the class ceiling” are truly ambitious and can be delivered without splashing huge amounts of cash. His aides point out that policies to mend a broken public realm have to be devised within the bleak economic conditions the Tories have created. The economic outlook, they say, is far worse than that faced by Tony Blair and New Labour before the 1997 general election. Starmer says public services can and must be reformed without vast sums of money – “it is reform or bust”, he says. The answer, he adds, lies in adopting new approaches, such as empowering those on the frontline to deliver services geared more closely to the personal needs of those who use them. Rejecting one of the big ideas of New Labour, Starmer says: “Not top-down targets that try to bludgeon skilled professionals into inefficient processes but empower those on the frontline to deliver real improvements.” Starmer’s intervention comes as Labour attempts to make history on Thursday by overturning a majority of more than 20,000 in the Conservative heartland seat of Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire. This weekend, it is continuing to pour resources into the campaign. Labour is also expected to win Boris Johnson’s old seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, but officials report that the Tories are having some success in focusing voters’ concerns on London mayor Sadiq Khan’s plans to expand the capital’s ultra-low emission zone. In the third byelection on Thursday, the Liberal Democrats, rather than Labour, are the main challengers to the Tories in Somerton and Frome. Labour insiders say they have amassed data from hundreds of thousands of interviews with voters that shows most people are now so distrusting of politicians that they would not believe their promises, whoever made them. The first task, Starmer’s team believes, is therefore to recreate that trust by being credible. Tensions within Labour about its cautious approach are most likely to come to a head next weekend, when Labour officials meet with unions, MPs and affiliated groups at its national policy forum (NFP) in Nottingham. The event, a formal part of Labour’s policy development programme, will see the leadership pushed to adopt policies such as proportional representation, the abolition of the two-child policy and universal free school meals for state primary schools in England. While the decisions made are not binding on Starmer, shadow cabinet ministers have warned that it will be a “difficult moment” for the leadership. Some of those involved are now aiming to stop Starmer from dumping more of the policy programme he had previously endorsed, such as a commitment to increase sick pay. “The caution at the top of the party is so extreme that we’re even watering down or rejecting the policies we’ve already announced,” said one figure involved in the process. “Under Blair, we established Sure Start, led a global debt-cancellation programme and increased health and education spending. Where’s the ambition now? If we win the next election, we’re going to inherit an economy in far worse shape than in 1997 – if we don’t invest and offer some real solutions, we’re just creating a rod for our own back.” It will also be a moment for Labour’s left to attack Starmer’s approach. “As Labour members, unions and conference recognise, fixing their mess requires real ambition, with nationalisation of our failing, privatised public services, real investment in our decaying infrastructure and an end to the scourge of low pay,” said a Momentum spokesperson. “That’s why, at the NPF next week, Momentum-backed reps will make the case for policies like public ownership of our utilities, free school meals, rent controls and the restoration of British democracy. The case for transformative change in the interests of the many has never been stronger or more popular - we urge the leadership to heed it.” • This article was amended on 16 July 2023.

Every individual needs a purpose, it becomes their fuel, and the same can be said for every team. That is not to say Saracens do not have one but what I love about this Sale side is how clear their purpose is – to put northern rugby back on the map. They are desperately important to the Premiership in that sense and I’m so pleased they’ve made it to Twickenham. Playing for something beyond yourself can be such a driving force. We saw it with Rassie Erasmus building the narrative around the South African people for the Springboks in 2019 and Sale will be aware that they are representing so many more people than there are in the squad, in the changing room and even in the stands. Leaning into that can be huge. These are two evenly matched sides but the gulf is in experience. I don’t see Sale’s youngsters like Arron Reed, Tom Roebuck, Joe Carpenter and Gus Warr being fazed by the Twickenham occasion, though. They’ve proved themselves to be excellent players on too consistent a basis for that. That said, there’s nothing that can prepare you for the occasion like playing in it previously and Saracens have someone who is preparing to start in his ninth Premiership final in Alex Goode. That is a remarkable statistic. For Saracens it’s yet another trip to Twickenham and it’s safe to say that the tools are that little bit sharper than last season, when they did so incredibly well to reach the final in their first season back in the Premiership. This year there should be no redemption narrative. Rather, it’s an opportunity to celebrate a remarkably consistent season with a trophy. They have been models of excellence throughout the season, unbeaten at home, comfortably top of the table but they will know that will count for nothing if they do not win the title. That should be what they are fighting for as opposed to any external noise or pressure. There are mouthwatering clashes all over the pitch but for me the battle of fly-halves and flankers top the bill. A fly-half’s ability to influence proceedings is dependent on the direction in which their forward pack is travelling but in George Ford and Owen Farrell we have two special No 10s. For all the debate about who should start for England I truly hope that for 80 minutes we can just appreciate both. They’ve grown up together throughout their rugby life so it’s no surprise that they have so many similarities. The way they see the game and analyse the game, they’re the closest thing to having a player-coach on the pitch that you’ll get and that’s such a calming influence to have. But there are differences. In attack, Ford has a better feel and instinct for the game but that’s something that Farrell has really developed. You look at his team and the extra gears they have found, there seems to be a greater freedom to Saracens in attack and a greater freedom to Owen in himself as well. We’re looking at two of England’s great fly-halves. They both played in Premiership finals as 19-year-olds and there are more things that connect them than split them apart. This is a day to celebrate both of them. While both teams have injuries in the back row, Ben Earl’s duel with Tom Curry will be explosive. Curry’s game in attack has really come on in the last couple of years. I remember when he first got selected by England at No 8. His best position is No 7 (even if he’s at 6 on Saturday) and I wondered how he’d manage but what I saw was him take on that responsibility and become a better ball player and a better ball carrier. Earl, we know how dynamic and powerful he could be; he could look very comfortable at centre. He’s the closest thing we have to Levani Botia, it’s not a perfect comparison but he wouldn’t look out of place in the backline. That’s a really key head-to-head because when you have two teams like this, and with the battle lines drawn at the gainline, whoever is able to win those physical exchanges and disrupt the attacking flow will ultimately win this match. Enter the main stage Ben Earl and Tom Curry. The closer we get to the game the more nervous I get and I’m not even playing. On Monday I said Saracens would win straight off the bat. The only reason I’m now hesitant is because I’ve got so much respect for Sale, they’re a quality side. Emotionally they’ll be in the right place but if there’s not much between the teams maybe the chasm in terms of experience in matches like this will prove pivotal in the end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-31T21:56:44Z","webTitle":"US accuses Russia of violating key nuclear arms control treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/31/us-russia-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"The United States has accused Russia of violating the New Start treaty, the last major pillar of post-cold war nuclear arms control between the two countries, saying Moscow was refusing to allow inspection activities on its territory. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years. It caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. The two countries, which during the cold war were constrained by a tangle of arms control agreements, still account together for about 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads. Washington has been keen to preserve the treaty but ties with Moscow are the worst in decades over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an element that could complicate attempts by Joe Biden’s administration to maintain and reach a follow-on agreement. “Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of US-Russian nuclear arms control,” a state department spokesperson said in emailed comments. Moscow in August suspended cooperation with inspections under the treaty, blaming travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies after Russian forces invaded neighbor Ukraine in February last year, but said it was still committed to complying with the provisions of the treaty. The state department spokesperson added that Russia had a “clear path” for returning to compliance by allowing inspection activities, and that Washington remains ready to work with Russia to fully implement the treaty. “The New Start treaty remains in the national security interests of the United States,” the spokesperson said. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections under New Start were due to take place in November in Egypt, but Russia postponed them, accusing the United States of “toxicity and animosity”, and neither side has set a new date. On Monday, Russia told the United States that the treaty could expire in 2026 without a replacement because it said Washington was trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Moscow in Ukraine. Asked if Moscow could envisage there being no nuclear arms control treaty after 2026, deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the RIA state new agency: “This is quite a possible scenario.” The United States has supplied more than $27bn in security assistance to Ukraine since the invasion, including more than 1,600 Stinger anti-aircraft rocket systems, 8,500 Javelin anti-tank missile systems and 1m 155mm artillery rounds. Russian president Vladimir Putin has issued thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, reviving cold war era fears of an apocalyptic war. Shortly after taking office, Biden extended New Start by five years until 2026, giving time to negotiate while preserving what the Democratic administration sees as an important existing treaty. The previous administration of Donald Trump had ripped up previous arms control agreements and had been hesitant to preserve New Start in its current form, saying that any nuclear treaty must also include China, whose arsenal is rapidly growing but still significantly below those of Russia and the United States."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-19T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Nuclear nightmare: reckless leaders push the world back to the brink | Simon Tisdall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/19/nuclear-nightmare-reckless-leaders-push-the-world-back-to-the-brink-putin-israel-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"Leaders of unstable nuclear-armed states do dangerous and foolish things when under stress. They miscalculate, provoke, overreach. Given the febrile state of bilateral relations, last week’s aerial military clash between Russia and the US over the Black Sea inevitably intensified fears of nuclear escalation. The incident dramatised how dangerous Vladimir Putin, cornered by his existential Ukraine blunder, truly is – and the risks he is increasingly prepared to run. But he’s not the only one. As often the case over the past year, Putin relied on American restraint. US forces could easily have gone after the offending Su-27 fighter at its Crimea base. Each time Russia’s president darkly hints at going nuclear, that once unthinkable prospect becomes a little less outlandish – and western leaders must steel their nerves. Russia’s repeated bombing of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fits this pattern of minacious brinkmanship. Russia possesses about 1,600 deployed strategic nuclear warheads, out of a military stockpile of about 4,500. Like the US and other nuclear weapons states, it is modernising and adding new systems. At the same time, a vital safety net of arms control treaties dating from the Soviet era is shredding. Last month, Putin ditched New Start, which caps deployed strategic nuclear arsenals. It was Russia’s last such treaty with the US. In other words, at the very moment when the Kremlin is under unprecedented pressure and US-Russia relations are at their most tense since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, the political channels, agreed mechanisms and binding limits that could help avoid a nuclear collision are less robust and dependable than ever before. While the risk of unintended nuclear confrontation is ever-present, Putin’s recklessness makes it infinitely worse. Israel is another nuclear-armed state under extreme stress, mostly due to its volatile rightwing prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu’s perceived attempt to avoid jail by destroying judicial independence, and with it Israel’s democracy, has caused uproar. Significantly, his “coup” is under fire from serving members of the military and former defence ministers as well as much of civil society. If this destabilising nationwide upheaval were taking place in Pakistan, for example, loud international expressions of concern about the security of its secretive nuclear arsenal would be heard. So the comparative silence over the safety and control of Israel’s 90 or so undeclared warheads is disturbing. Amid an extraordinary standoff between Netanyahu and US president Joe Biden, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, fears civil war. “The abyss is within touching distance,” he said last week. There is good reason to worry about what Netanyahu may do, Putin-like, to escape his self-made troubles. He has threatened to bomb Iran’s nuclear facilities in the past. Israeli media suggest he may now be planning an attack. Netanyahu warned this month of a “horrible nuclear war” unless Tehran’s uranium enrichment programme was halted. Would he start a Middle East conflict to save his skin? Past experience suggests he might. If the US and its allies were not so distracted by Ukraine, they might pay more attention to Netanyahu’s antics. Much the same may be said of the developing crisis in nuclear-armed North Korea, where inherent weakness is compounded by looming famine. New doubts surround dictator Kim Jong-un’s health and a problematic succession. Stirring the pot, China and Russia back him against the west despite the danger he poses. Kim spent last week firing off nuclear-capable ballistic missiles like there’s no tomorrow – and there may not be if he carries on like this. Analysts anticipate another underground atomic test. Kim regularly threatens the US – and South Korea and Japan, which met last week to ponder what to do. Earlier this month he ordered his military to prepare for “real war”. Is Kim waving or drowning, seeking attention or waxing desperate? Ignoring North Korea, which is unspoken western policy, stores up trouble. It’s difficult to tell from his lugubrious appearance but Xi Jinping, China’s newly anointed president for life, is a leader under severe pressure, too. His zero-Covid policy damaged a struggling economy and sparked something close to popular revolt. His aggressive foreign policy, debt diplomacy and rights abuses have produced a global anti-China backlash. By vowing to conquer US-backed Taiwan come what may, Xi has created another rod for his back. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which CIA director William Burns predicts may happen by 2027, is a probable nuclear flashpoint – especially if it goes badly for Xi. It’s estimated China has about 400 operational nuclear warheads, rising to approximately 1,000 by 2030. American nuclear-armed ships, submarines and bombers constantly patrol the western Pacific. For his part, Xi can point to continuing US and UK nuclear weapons modernisation, and to last week’s deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. China complained at the UN that the deal breached the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by transferring fissile material and nuclear technology to a non-nuclear weapons state. In an arrogant riposte, the US claimed it would actually strengthen non-proliferation efforts – without explaining how. Iran and others will register this double standard. The longstanding refusal of the main powers to disarm is the root cause of rising nuclear tensions – but irresponsible present-day political leaders greatly exacerbate the danger. “The United States and its allies … are faced with a choice,” wrote Lt Col Brent Stricker of the US Naval War College in a bleak assessment of the changing nuclear world order. They could either “restart arms limitation discussions to include both Russia and China, or restart the arms race”. The former course is wildly improbable at this juncture. So the old cold war-era nuclear helter-skelter ride towards mutually assured destruction looks set to resume and accelerate – under new, stressed-out management.

British prime ministers change so rapidly these days that a similar approach would risk recasting during rehearsal. However, Atri Banerjee’s deliberately non-Spitting Image RSC production stresses the remarkable universality of the play’s dissection of leaders and the led, fulfilling Cassius’s prophecy that Caesar’s murder will be “acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown”. The wider political context now is the flimsiness of power. Of the core world leaders who attended the 2019 G7 meeting, only two remain in power and one, Japan’s Shinzo Abe, was assassinated after leaving office. As the psephological sage John Curtice has pointed out, almost no head of government who led a country through Covid is still in post. Such churn gives urgency to the scene in which the conspirators discuss wanting power and what they will do with it; Brutus, leaving Mark Anthony in play, pays later for his kindness/weakness. In this version, Brutus and Cassius are played by Thalissa Teixeira and Kelly Gough, the characters’ pronouns changed to “she” and “her”, although curiously Anthony’s eulogy for Brutus still predicts that people will say: “This was a man!” There’s an intriguing hint of an anti-feminist dystopia in which women – also including Ella Dacres’ Octavius Caesar – are forced, like some nuns, to take male names, and this may also be an attempt at complete gender-fluidity of language, but the switches sometimes jar between eye and ear. Movement director Jennifer Jackson introduces a prologue and interludes in which actors swirl and howl, reminiscent of Bill Viola’s video installations of choreographed mobs. This underlines the play’s reflections on crowds and power, and more is made than usual of the feast of Lupercal being as significant a date as the Ides of March, this play sometimes seeming to be previewing Macbeth’s supernatural framing. Startlingly, stabbed Caesar bleeds black blood, possibly hinting at the oil greed of capitalism, which stains his assassins for the rest of the play. The crackle of these additions is sometimes absent from the dialogue. Though Banerjee eschews the enclosing Perspex box so modish in classical productions, there can feel to be a cold screen between actors and audience, possibly because the staging must fit nine different theatres on a UK tour. As Mark Antony, William Robinson suggests a weak, wonkish figure who rises higher than rivals expect, underlining Shakespeare’s prescience in identifying all known political types, as do Teixeira and Gough’s respective embodiments of an intellectual but unworldly and impatiently passionate legislator: most systems have such a Brutus and Cassius. Nigel Barrett’s cockily populist Caesar rings various alarm bells around the world, and Matthew Bulgo makes Casca the sort of cultured, honey-voiced thug that all administrations seem to have. Annabel Baldwin strikingly extends the role of Soothsayer into scene-shifter and conscience of the populace. That Julius Caesar ends with an unlikely and uneasy coalition in charge will also prove, in many places, further evidence of the eternal political truths of the play.

As Jack Shenker describes in his article (The existential question for climate activists: have disruption tactics stopped working?, 6 March), Extinction Rebellion’s recent decision to stop disrupting the public caused quite a fuss. Some people applauded the move as they thought it would favourably shift public opinion, while others insisted public disruption needs to remain a primary tactic to garner wider attention. Unfortunately, both camps are missing the point – once you have enough dedicated activists, the public is largely irrelevant to achieving political change. It is not the opinion, or even attention, of the public that matters, it is whether or not you are disrupting structures of power. Historical social movements have shown this repeatedly. Despite what we may like to believe in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government. It may theoretically give governments a mandate to act, but real change must first overcome powerful opposition from the structures that support governments, such as business and the legal and financial systems. The role of activists is to change the cost-benefit equation for these structures until it is more beneficial for them to accept change than to carry on with the status quo. For climate activists, the real question is not about the efficacy of disruptive tactics, it needs to be about targets. And the answer is power, not the public. Dr Laura Thomas-Walters Llandaff, Cardiff • What can we do about the climate crisis? What form should our protest take? Do the actions of Extinction Rebellion risk alienating those who they look to for support? Indigo Rumbelow, a supporter of Just Stop Oil and co-founder of Insulate Britain, takes the view that the debate “is not between those who want to take ‘moderate’ or ‘radical’ action. It’s between those who are standing by doing nothing at all, and those who are doing something. That’s where the line is drawn.” But it should never be like this. A democracy should allow voters to choose how their country is governed. There should be a constitutional requirement for those of us seriously concerned about the climate crisis to have our views expressed in government. This obviously doesn’t happen. Our government consists only of Tory MPs representing a minority of voters. Yes, we have offshore wind generation, but otherwise their response is desperately inadequate. As a result, we have to resort to any kind of protest we feel might make a difference. If our civilisation truly wants a route to survival, we need a representative democracy with proportional voting. Tim Williamson Bath • Jack Shenker asks if disruption tactics have stopped working in climate protests. I would ask: did they ever work? Starting with the suffragists and suffragettes (or possibly earlier), most radical and progressive movements have had extreme wings, driven by a sense of frustration that their voice is not being listened to. I would love to see some academic work try to quantify the effect of publicity-seeking “stunts” against patient political foot-slogging. Having spent most of my life doing the latter, I feel politics does work. I was born into a world where homosexuality and abortion were illegal and mixed‑race marriage regarded as immoral. That has changed. Conventional politicians such as Roy Jenkins and David Steel did their stuff – and succeeded. Paul Chandler Brighton • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, a skewed election system means the shape of the new government is “very unpredictable”, say analysts, and it is not clear if pro-democracy candidates will succeed in unseating the generals. Since 2014, Thailand has been ruled by Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who first came to power in a coup and who was later elected prime minister. A staunch royalist and conservative, Prayuth has run a strongly nationalistic election campaign, warning that opposition parties’ promised reform will bring chaos. Polling, however, has suggested that many voters do want change. Pheu Thai, the party associated with the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is expected to win the most seats. At Pheu Thai’s final big rally on Friday, his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, one of the party’s three prime ministerial candidates, told crowds that Sunday would be a “historic day” where Thailand will move “from junta rule to democratic rule”. Move Forward, the most progressive opposition party, has also enjoyed late surges in polling after capturing strong support from young voters during its campaigns. Younger generations have been drawn to its pledge to demilitarise politics and break up monopolies. It is also the only party to promise to reform the lese majeste law, under which criticism of Thailand’s powerful monarchy can lead to 15 years in prison. Sunday’s election is the first to be held after youth-led mass protests in 2020 shocked the establishment by calling not only for the removal of Prayuth, but also for the influence and wealth of the monarchy to be curbed – criticising an institution previously considered untouchable. Campaigning has featured unprecedented discussion of the lese majeste law, a new fault line in Thai politics. “It’s the first time in history that every political party has to talk about their stance on this sensitive topic,” said Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Thammasat University in Bangkok. This year’s election is “not only a referendum on the military, but the whole establishment”, he said, citing the increased questioning of the royal family’s role in society. The vote, Prajak said, “will be a crucial step for Thailand to return to democracy”. But he added: “The path may not be smooth.” Parties will be competing for 500 seats in the House of Representatives on Sunday, but even if opposition parties do well, they may not be able to take power. A future prime minister will be voted on jointly by the elected lower house and the senate – the latter’s 250 members having been appointed by the military after the last coup. Parties such as Pheu Thai will almost certainly need to form alliances to overcome this hurdle. “The electoral results can be predicted easily, but the government formation is very unpredictable,” said Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, who added that unlikely partnerships are still possible. Kasinee Sudatip, 52, a voter in Khlong Toei, Bangkok, said she was so excited for Sunday’s election, she could barely sleep the night before. She has always supported Pheu Thai and will vote for them again, she said, adding that she wanted democracy back. The economy was much better under Thaksin, she added. “Poor people gained a lot of benefits. They introduced the 30 baht for the health treatment and also for funds for education,” she said, referring to Thailand’s universal healthcare scheme. Surangkana Kornsawat, 27, who works in a beauty clinic, who also voted in Khlong Toei, Bangkok, said she was supporting More Forward. “I want to see a new future Thailand - for new people to come and work for the country,” she said, adding she was tired of the ruling military-backed party. “I’ve been feeling the impact of them for eight years and it’s really bad. It’s a lot – too much to say. The electricity bill is high, the economy is bad.” She wanted democratic change, she added, including reform of the lese majesty law. If Pheu Thai won, that would also be ok, she added: “I’m just anti-dictatorship”. Opposition candidates could face extra-parliamentary moves that would keep them from power. Last week, a complaint was filed against Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of Move Forward, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied any wrongdoing. Complaints have also been filed against Pheu Thai. Pheu Thai’s campaign this year has been boosted by Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn, who has helped revive nostalgia for her father. However, at a rally on Friday night her fellow candidate Srettha Thavisin, a property tycoon, declared that he wanted “to serve as Thailand’s 30th prime minister”, prompting speculation that he could be the party’s primary candidate for leader. Thaksin, who remains a polarising figure, lives in exile to avoid legal charges. However, he has repeatedly commented that he would like to return – a prospect that analysts say could bring about political instability. For two decades, Thai politics have been shaped by division between Pheu Thai’s Shinawatra family versus the conservative military establishment. The power struggle between the two sides has resulted in long-running street protests and two military coups."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T14:21:08Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","fields":{"bodyText":"In his letter (22 December), Tom Smith describes the problems of storing the radioactive waste that is being produced by the UK nuclear reactors, and says that we need more honesty about these issues. The latter is also true of other problems with “new nuclear build”. Take, for example, the proposed Sizewell C reactor on the east coast. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that extreme “sea level events” could occur “at least once per year at many locations by 2050”. Sizewell C will be built near the sea on marshland. One engineer has estimated that the land where the reactor would be built will turn into a promontory encircled by the sea. Clearly the reactor site could be flooded. Then there is the problem of obtaining uranium, which is currently the fuel for the nuclear reactors. The UK has to import uranium from across the world. It is mainly mined on the land of Indigenous people – in the US, in Canada, in Australia and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The miners and their families have suffered years of ill health and even death from proximity to uranium. At the same time, having to import uranium means that this is not an independent source of energy for the UK. The government and the opposition have completely ignored all warnings; they go doggedly on, supporting the construction of the new nuclear reactor at Sizewell and considering plans to build others. But nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements. Apart from anything else, it is vastly expensive.

The opposition’s energy spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, suggested the Labor government could be “wilfully lying” about the “true cost” of the energy transition, while others have questioned the evidence that solar and wind are the cheapest forms of power. In the Australian, two columns claimed to have uncovered a fatal flaw in how the cost of solar and wind gets compared with coal, gas and the currently-illegal nuclear. There is a lot to unpick – but not because any true scandal has been uncovered. Many of the claims centre on two reports that most Australians will not have heard of and even fewer will have spent any time reading. Every year a small team at CSIRO produces a report called GenCost that discusses changes in the costs of different generating technologies and also ways to store energy, such as in batteries or dams. Two columns in the Australian by Claire Lehmann have attacked one metric that’s calculated in the GenCost report known as the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE). It’s a metric that’s used to illustrate how competitive different technologies are, and it takes into account costs such as fuel (for solar and wind that cost is zero, but for coal and gas it’s not) and how much electricity is generated. The LCOE metric shows clearly that solar and onshore wind are easily the cheapest forms of electricity right now. But Lehmann, and critics she quotes, say it’s misleading because it does not account for the cost of adding transmission lines and storage to the grid that enable those renewables. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup This is largely true, but is not a secret. Right now, renewable energy is being installed on a system that includes expensive transmission towers and lines and that since its inception was designed, built and maintained to accommodate coal. In calculating LCOE, the GenCost report treats planned spending on major transmission and storage projects, including Snowy 2.0, up to 2030 as already committed. Lehmann and critics say treating these projects as “sunk costs” amounts to a “creative accounting method” and disguises the true cost of renewables. But Lehmann doesn’t mention that the same GenCost report includes a long explanation of why this is done. In short, a stakeholder in the year 2030 who wants to have an idea of the cost of building new renewable energy generation is not interested in investments that have already been made into the grid to integrate renewables. And in 2030, the GenCost report shows the LCOE for solar and wind is far cheaper than any other technology, including the cost of any further investments that will be needed to be made to support high levels of renewable energy. Lehmann described GenCost as “probably the most important document in Australia’s energy transition” – a statement that several energy system analysts told the Guardian isn’t true. That document is the Australian Energy Market Operator’s Integrated System Plan – a mammoth 100 pages with a dozen supporting reports and appendices. That plan’s raison d’être is to consult with industry and then lay out how to develop the electricity system for the coming decades to achieve reliability (the lights need to stay on), affordability (what’s the lowest cost mix of generation technologies, transmission and storage) and is in line with climate targets. The challenge for Australia is not to just deploy the cheapest form of electricity. The question is “what’s the cheapest electricity system that’s reliable and will meet climate targets?”. According to the ISP, the answer to that question is to use solar and wind energy, backed by storage. And, as energy experts pointed out to the Guardian, the ISP does not use the LCOE calculations from GenCost. A $62bn black hole? A story in the Australian last week claimed there was a “$62bn black hole” in Labor’s energy plan, and that this had been “exposed by industry experts and the Coalition”. Actually, the story hung on the claim of one expert, David Carland. And the “black hole”, claimed by O’Brien, is fiction. Carland’s analysis, seen by Temperature Check, lists a number of known projects that were already considered by Aemo when it produced its most recent ISP. Carland argues several of these projects will cost more than was originally planned – and for Snowy 2.0 this is certainly true – but that’s very different from a project not being considered at all in Aemo’s plans. Carland, who has previously pushed for Aemo to model a future electricity grid that continues to rely on coal, also identifies some other “costs” that should be considered before GenCost calculates LCOE for renewables. Tennant Reed, the climate and energy director at Ai Group and an energy systems expert, reviewed Carland’s submission and questioned many of the assumptions made. In a long email, Reed told Guardian Australia he thought Carland’s analysis included inflated numbers and double counting. For example, Reed said the analysis includes a $1.6bn “cost” from state-based schemes that contract the supply of renewables. He said even if that number was right, its inclusion was wrong because “these contracts don’t add to the underlying cost of renewables, they are part of how that underlying cost is paid for”. Reed wrote that Carland’s analysis “fundamentally misses the point that ISP, not GenCost, is the relevant exercise for considering the optimal system development path to 2030 and beyond.” The least-cost option? Anyone suggesting the ISP ignores the cost of building an electricity system that’s centred on renewable energy compared with any other technology that’s available has likely not looked at the mountains of information available. The ISP includes five major transmission projects that are part of its “optimal development path” and will cost $12.7bn to build ( they’re HumeLink, VNI West, Marinus Link, Sydney Ring and New England REZ Transmission Link). But the report also says building these projects will realise benefits more than double their cost. Without them, the report says, the NEM would have to rely on more expensive gas and offshore wind, raising costs and burning a hole in the carbon budget. The GenCost report and the more relevant ISP are not the only pieces of analysis that suggest the cheapest way to build a reliable and low emission electricity system is to use renewables backed up by storage. In 2019 the Grattan Institute published its “Go for Net Zero” report that found it was possible to turn off coal and get to very high levels of renewable energy without compromising on reliability. Tony Wood, energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute, said they found that renewables backed by storage, and with gas-fired power as a back-up, delivered a reliable system that “costs probably about the same as it is today, but you now have a system with very low emissions. And you get the emissions reduction for free.” Net Zero Australia was another major effort to model the most economic way to decarbonise the grid from the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, Princeton University and international management consultancy Nous Group. That modelling, released earlier this year, came to similar conclusions to the ISP – that wind and solar energy with storage such as batteries and hydro, and backed up by small amounts of gas-fired power, was the most economical path. And the analysis included all costs, including the construction of extra transmission lines. The nuclear question Much of the commentary in rightwing media is interlaced with exasperation from some nuclear energy supporters that their emissions-free technology has been overlooked. The Coalition is making so-called small modular reactors – a set of technologies not yet commercially available and, like other nuclear generation, not legal in Australia – the centrepiece of its energy policy. Aemo has said it “does not model technologies that are not allowable under existing laws, and this includes nuclear generation”. In a statement, it pointed to the GenCost report that “shows that nuclear generation is higher cost and has a longer lead time than renewables backed by storage and transmission”. The Net Zero Australia modelling has looked at what role nuclear could play if it was to become legal in Australia from 2035 onwards. The modelling suggested nuclear only becomes economical if the cost of the current cheapest nuclear generation was to fall by a further 30% while, at the same time, the supply of renewables was constrained (meaning, for example, major problems in the supply of materials needed for renewables or a scenario where major community pushback sees renewables lose their social licence). Even in this scenario, nuclear power plays only a minor role in a clean, reliable and affordable electricity system, with wind and solar doing the vast majority of the heavy lifting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T15:43:31Z","webTitle":"Spain renews call for US to remove soil from nuclear accident site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/06/spain-renews-call-us-remove-soil-nuclear-accident-site","fields":{"bodyText":"Nearly 60 years after a midair collision dumped four US hydrogen bombs in south-eastern Spain, strewing radioactive plutonium across the landscape, Spanish officials have renewed efforts to have Washington cart off tens of thousands of cubic metres of contaminated soil to the US for storage. A source at Spain’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed on Monday that it had formally requested the US takes action to remove the radioactive earth. The request is in line with a non-binding agreement struck between the two countries in 2015 and which included a US commitment to “arrange for disposal of the contaminated earth at an appropriate site in the United States”. As the US had yet to formally respond, the source declined to offer further details. El País, the Spanish newspaper that first reported the story, said the request had been lodged a few months ago. The US government did not respond to a request for comment. The demand is the latest chapter in a saga that traces back to January 1966 when a US B-52 bomber loaded with nuclear weapons collided with a tanker plane during a midair refuelling operation off the coast of Almeria, Spain. Seven of the two planes’ 11 crew members were killed. Four hydrogen bombs tumbled from the B-52; one was later recovered intact in the Mediterranean while the other three crashed on land near the coastal village of Palomares. While the bombs did not explode, two of the plutonium-filled detonators went off, scattering 7lb of radioactive plutonium-239 across the landscape. The US sent about 1,600 servicemen to the crash site to recover the weapons and clean up the contamination. About 1,400 tonnes of contaminated soil was shipped to a facility in South Carolina. Both countries were eager to downplay the collision, which took place during the height of the cold war and as Spain was in the grip of the Franco dictatorship. Amid fears that the risk of radioactive contamination would harm the country’s budding tourism industry, Spain’s then tourism minister and the US ambassador took a widely publicised swim in the sea off the coast of Palomares in the weeks after the incident. Concerns over the lingering impacts of the collision catapulted back into the spotlight in 2007, after a study suggested up to 50,000 sq metres of land remained contaminated. The affected area was fenced off and barred from being used for agriculture or development. In 2015 Madrid and Washington signed off on an agreement to negotiate a binding deal for the site’s remediation. “We have to build on today’s signing to take further action to resolve – once and for all – this very important issue,” the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, said during a joint press conference with the Spanish foreign minister at the time, José Manuel García-Margallo. Little was done to implement the agreement, however, as elections ushered in changes in Spain and the US. The Spanish government’s recent decision to take up the issue again with the US was prompted by the assessment that bilateral relations were “at their best in years,” sources told El País, leaving Madrid hopeful that some progress could be made before Spain heads to the polls for general elections at the end of the year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/07/japan-fukushima-water-release","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-07T01:51:44Z","webTitle":"Japan to start Fukushima water release within weeks – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/07/japan-fukushima-water-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/07/japan-fukushima-water-release","fields":{"bodyText":"Japan plans to start releasing treated radioactive water from the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean as soon as late August, Japan’s Asahi Shimbun daily reported on Monday, citing unnamed government sources. The release is likely to come shortly after the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, meets the US president, Joe Biden, and the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, next week in the US, where Kishida planned to explain the safety of the water in question, it reported. Japan’s nuclear regulator last month granted approval for plant operator Tokyo Electric Power to start releasing the water, which Japan and the International Atomic Energy Agency say is safe but nearby countries fear may contaminate food. Bottom-trawling fishing was scheduled to start off Fukushima, north-east of Tokyo, in September, and the government aimed to start the water discharge before the fishing season got under way, the newspaper said. In July the UN’s nuclear watchdog approved plans by Japan to release the water, despite objections from local fishing communities and other countries in the region. About 1.3m tonnes of water stored in huge tanks on the site has been filtered through Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system (Alps) to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The “treated” water – Japanese officials object to the use of the word “contaminated” – will be diluted with seawater so that the concentration of tritium is well below internationally approved levels before being released into the ocean 1km from the shoreline via an undersea tunnel. The water – enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools - becomes contaminated when it is used to cool fuel rods that melted after the power plant was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Discharging the water is expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete. Attempts by Japanese government officials to win regional support for the plan have had limited success. China denounced the plan as “extremely irresponsible” when it was announced in 2021. Hong Kong has threatened to ban food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures if the water release goes ahead as planned.

Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public. • This article was amended on 7 April 2022. An earlier version said “targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030”. That should have referred to offshore wind and domestic low-carbon energy sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-01T12:58:58Z","webTitle":"The debt ceiling fight was never about debt. It was about Republican power | Mark Weisbrot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/01/debt-ceiling-fight-democracy-republican-power-extortion","fields":{"bodyText":"The debt ceiling drama seems to be nearing its end, as the US House of Representatives passed legislation that would lift the debt ceiling in accordance with a deal reached last weekend between Joe Biden, the president, and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House. The Republicans have been fighting to force cuts in spending and/or eligibility for food stamps (Snap), Medicaid, childcare and pre-schools, education and grants for higher education. By linking these and other provisions to the lifting of the debt ceiling, the Republicans tried to use the threat of default on the public debt to force Democrats to accept them. The legislation, which now goes to the Senate where it is expected to pass, did not satisfy most of their desires. The worst abuse that Republicans managed to include will be suffered by the hundreds of thousands of poor people who will likely lose access to food assistance under the Snap program. Many are in poor health and will not be able to complete the work requirements that Republicans have insisted on imposing for people of age 50-54; others will lose benefits due to additional red tape. There was also damage done by the fictitious narrative that Republicans were able to successfully promote about the “ticking time bomb” of the public debt. There is no bomb and if there were, it would not be ticking. The relevant measure of our debt burden is how much we pay annually in net interest on the debt, as a share of our national income (or roughly, GDP). That number was 1.9% for 2022. That is not big, by any comparison. We averaged about 3% in the 1990s, while experiencing America’s then longest-running economic expansion. The constant repetition of the “threat” posed by our national debt was a big win for Republicans, who are always looking to cut spending on social needs and safety nets; and more strategically important, to cut spending that could aid recovery from an economic downturn when Democrats are in power. In the Great Recession (December 2007 to June 2009), Republicans fought against measures to stimulate an economic recovery, which were already too small as proposed by Democrats. By October 2010, unemployment was still at 9.4%. In the election a month later, Republicans gained 63 seats to take the House and six Senate seats. The debt ceiling was used to threaten the Biden administration with a default on the public debt if they did not agree to Republican demands, mostly for spending cuts. The ceiling itself doesn’t affect new spending; it’s just holding up a chunk of the spending that our government is already obligated by law to carry out. In a democracy, this type of extortion should not be permitted. But Republican power isn’t based on democracy; on the contrary, it’s become highly dependent on institutions and practices that most people, including experts, would consider undemocratic or anti-democratic. Republicans benefit enormously from the fact that 80% of senators are elected by about 50% of voters. And if that’s not slanted enough, there is the filibuster, which effectively requires a 60-vote majority to win almost any pro-democracy reforms. This includes changes that are needed even for the Senate as presently constituted: eg representation for Washington DC, which has more population than a couple of states. We are the only democracy in the world where people who live in our national capital city don’t have full voting rights. Then there is voter suppression and gerrymandering, for both state and federal elections. These two methods of influencing election outcomes have gone hand-in-hand. Of course swing states are prime targets: recall that Republican presidents who ruled for 12 of the past 22 years came to power while losing the popular vote. When Republicans win, they then use their power to stack the cards further in their favor. This includes packing the judiciary, where Republican judges advance their agenda. Their decades-long struggle to control the judiciary reached its pinnacle with a 6-3 majority of the US supreme court, with five justices appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote. The current Republican majority now “substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law”, the dissenting justices wrote when that majority revoked the right to abortion last year. Dozens of senators have described the supreme court as “captured” by “dark money” from Republican donors, including “rightwing billionaires”, and it is currently facing lost credibility as well as accusations of corruption. If the Republicans had gotten all that they had included in their legislation to lift the debt limit, it would have reduced the public debt by less than one half of 1% next year. This makes it even clearer that the debt ceiling fight was never really about debt reduction. It’s part of a vicious cycle in which political power is abused in order to consolidate a system that is increasingly undemocratic; and then further abused. The debt ceiling is just one part of that cycle, and should not have been negotiated; it needs to be abolished.

In his budget speech, the chancellor confirmed plans to spend the money over the next two decades on carbon capture and low carbon energy projects; announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. The government has created Great British Nuclear, a body designed to ease the creation of nuclear projects which are regularly delayed and over budget, and set a target for nuclear to “provide up to one quarter of our electricity by 2050”. Hunt, who has been under pressure to respond to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, said: “Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations.” However, climate campaigners attacked the drive, which had no giveaways for the solar or wind industries. Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies? “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now. “Committing to £20bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.” Helen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: “This spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as ‘environmentally sustainable’ and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK’s commitment to climate leadership.” Senior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed £700m towards. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a “huge step forward for UK energy security and net zero”. But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: “There is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.” Britain’s energy industry has been under the spotlight since the war in Ukraine pushed already-high oil and gas prices higher. On Wednesday, Hunt confirmed a widely expected U-turn in on a planned cut to energy support for households. He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to £11bn, representing just a fifth of the £55bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell. The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by £4bn this year, and £10bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November. The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further £3bn “but much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recouped” over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/04/emmanuel-macron-police-violence-france","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T16:14:36Z","webTitle":"Of course Macron won’t tackle police violence – he knows his power depends on it | Pauline Bock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/emmanuel-macron-police-violence-france","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/04/emmanuel-macron-police-violence-france","fields":{"bodyText":"As of this week, a crowdfunding campaign set up by the French far right in support of the police officer who shot and killed Nahel M, a 17-year-old from Nanterre, has now surpassed €1.4m. Around the same time that Nahel’s killer’s fund passed the €1m mark, it was reported that at least 120 young people who had been arrested in the unrest unleashed by his death had already been sent to prison. So far, this “swift, firm and systematic judicial response” to the riots, as demanded by the justice minister, Éric Dupond-Moretti, has been the only real response by the government to the unrest that has swept across French cities. Locals have been met with curfews and reduced transport in some cities, and in every cité where cars have burned and shops have been looted, the police presence has grown exponentially, with 45,000 officers deployed across France on Friday night. All this is symptomatic of the French government’s extraordinary creativity in its efforts to steer away from the reason of the banlieues’ anger – the police killing of a teenager, shot at point blank range in broad daylight after “refusing to comply” with an order – and avoid questioning the brutality of its police. Dupond-Moretti, whose own son was recently arrested for domestic violence, blamed the parents of the rioters: “Each time there are parents who are able to exercise their parental authority and don’t do so, there is a penal responsibility that must be applied,” he said. The president, Emmanuel Macron, blamed the riots on social media and video games, and the spokesperson for the French government offered his helpful analysis by estimating that the violence in the banlieues has “no political message”, adding: “It’s just pillaging.” According to the Bondy Blog, a local media site covering the Paris suburbs, a judge in a trial of those arrested over the weekend said that the reasons for their actions were “completely futile”. The article noted: “He did not once pronounce Nahel’s name.” A lawyer told the Swiss newspaper Blick that he feared such rushed hearings were designed to “twist the procedures to punish, whatever the cost” and risked “feeding the social pressure cooker”. Another lawyer warned of “expedited justice”, with “heavy sentences” despite “barely 15 minutes to go over the facts”. Meanwhile, the officer who shot Nahel has been suspended and is being investigated for “voluntary homicide”. His trial, if there is one, will not be held for months or years. When the UN asked France to pay heed to deep issues of racism and discrimination within the ranks of the French police – which, in any healthy democracy, should be cause for alarm – the French authorities replied that “any accusation of racism or systemic discrimination by the police forces in France is totally unfounded”. This response came on the same day as the press release written by two of the most influential police unions, which described rioters as “savage hordes” of “pests”. Nothing to see here! Certainly not racism! The GoFundMe for the officer, which has acted as a barrel of gasoline being poured over an already sizeable blaze, was barely addressed by the authorities. The prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, declared that “it probably does not contribute to the appeasement” of the situation, which must qualify as the understatement of the century. Calls to reform the French police have so far been ignored, despite being the only sensible way out of this hellish mess. “What should we do with the police” asks today’s edition of the daily newspaper Libération. A Green MP from the opposition has suggested a roadmap to an extensive police reform, which would include the creation of an independent body investigating the police, the end of war-grade weapons use by the police and – crucially – an independent audit of police racism. None of her proposals have been officially studied by the authorities so far. “Is the government scared of the police?” a journalist asked the housing minister, Olivier Klein, citing leftwing leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who declared so on Sunday night. Klein stuttered in response: “No! Uh, the government, uh … The government works with the police, fortunately.” Indeed, Macron’s regime has “worked with the police”, and ruled with its violence, since the start of the gilets jaunes crisis in 2018, during which 24 protesters lost an eye and five lost a hand to police weapons. Since then, climate activists, high school students, feminists, striking factory workers, rail workers, firefighters and the recent social movement against Macron’s pensions reform, which was forced through parliament without a vote, have all been repressed by police brutality. But according to Macron’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, “police violence doesn’t exist”. Last night, Darmanin and Macron went to meet Paris police officers on the ground to reiterate their support. The president praised the police’s “professionalism” and said: “We are with you.” Is Macron scared of the police? Or has he simply assessed the scales of power and decided that he would rather continue ruling with police violence instead of tackling it – even if that means setting the banlieues ablaze?

The Solar Pivot report by analysts Tim Buckley and Xuyang Dong said prices of polysilicon used to make the wafers in panels have fallen by two-thirds in 2023, sending panel prices down to US18c (A26.7c) a watt as of last month. Global installations of solar hit a record 268 gigawatts last year and could reach 1,000GW by 2030. “This would have profound implications for electricity and energy markets globally,” the report said. “CEF foresees the world could hit 1,000GW per annum of solar installs by 2030. This would have profound implications for electricity and energy markets globally.” Panel maker JinkoSolar last month announced plans for a US$7.9bn wafer-to-module solar factory in the Chinese province of Shanxi that alone will churn out as much as 56GW solar capacity a year. That scale is 19 times the biggest US plant – now being built - and compares with Australia’s total solar capacity of 30GW as 2022. “The energy sector for decades has failed to invest in technology,” Buckley said. “Now the Chinese are spending unbelievable amounts of money.” The US, the European Union and India are among economies also ramping up investments in solar energy. The motivation is partly to decarbonise their energy systems and reduce dependence on Russia but also to counter China’s growing domination of renewable technologies, particularly solar. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by the US Biden administration and which set aside $US369bn to bolster energy security and manufacturing, will drive a five-fold increase in yearly panel output to 40GW by 2024 and double solar installs to 40-50GW a year to 2030. By contrast, China is on track to have 12 solar manufacturing enterprises with annual module production capacity of 30GW each. It also will install 120-140GW of solar in 2023, doubling that to 260GW by 2030, the report said. Buckley said catching up with China if energy security was the goal was “a serious problem”. “They’re actually building market dominance with every year that goes by at the speed they’re moving,” he said, noting China’s share of global polysilicon output was already 75% in 2021 and will reach 90% by the end of this year. With all that expanded production capacity, “it’s an easy guess to say module prices will drop 30 or 40% by the end of this year versus where they were at 12-18 months ago,” Buckley said. Renate Egan, head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics based at the University of New South Wales, said the report was “comprehensive and optimistic”, underscoring solar’s falling cost compared with energy sources, including coal. Egan said the findings were consistent with work being done by the Australian PV Institute for the federal government. Other nations couldn’t replicate what China had done over two decades “in a few years”, but there were parts of the supply chain Australia could have competitive advantages, she said. These include minerals processing such as converting sand to metallurgical-grade silica. Similarly glass, aluminium and polymer components in modules could offer opportunities for Australia to focus on, Egan said. “There’s huge room for improvement in deployment and connection costs” for modules, she added. Finn Peacock, founder of SolarQuotes, said China’s factory gate solar panels were 15% cheaper this year. Given the slightly weaker Australian dollar, “it seems reasonable that solar panel installers should soon see around a 10% decline in panel prices compared to the end of last year”, he said. Wholesale prices for “a good mid-range panel” are about $0.50/watt, excluding GST, from Australian warehouses. Countering much of the decline, though, will be another 13% reduction in the solar rebate from next January. At present, a 10kW rooftop system costs each household about $11,000. That price includes the rebate, now worth about $4,400, which will fall to $3,840 next year. Online solar inquiries have spiked in the wake of the latest news of higher electricity prices with interest over the king’s birthday weekend up 30% from a year earlier, Peacock said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T13:29:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 231 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-231-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"At least seven people were killed and eight injured in a Russian strike on a crowded market in the town of Avdiivka, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region reported. “There is no military logic in such shelling - only an unbridled desire to kill as many of our people as possible and intimidate others,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Vladimir Putin has said Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was now in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via it, the Russian president said in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power again for a period of time, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines.

Of course they did. There’s been no end of Tories queueing up to profess their support for the prime minister in recent days, only to then point out where he was going badly wrong. They’ve even created their own death rattle. The sound of rats leaving a sinking ship. Lashing out even as they face extinction. On Monday, the newly minted New Conservatives group of 25 MPs elected since the Brexit referendum went public for the first time at an event taking place in the Unherd Club – the Westminster establishment location for anyone who wants to be considered anti-establishment. They claimed to be just like-minded MPs. Men and women merely interested in ensuring their own survival. Though that looks unlikely, given the talent on show. Rather, with the absurd John Hayes as their president, they were more likely expendable outriders for a Suella Braverman leadership bid after the next election. By which time many of the New Conservatives are likely to be far from parliament. Not that Suella cares about their survival. She is merely keen to undermine Rishi Sunak. Most of what we were to hear would have been Home Office policy were Braverman to have her way. Danny Kruger got things under way by saying sorry. He wanted to pass on Lee Anderson’s sincere apologies for not being able to host the event. Lee had recently been told that he wasn’t feeling very well – up until about two hours earlier he had been just fine – and so was staying in bed. Any suggestion he had been leant on to not turn up was completely untrue. The Tory party would have been totally relaxed about its deputy chair slagging off current government policy. “We want to take back control from the establishment,” the Oxford-educated Kruger declared. The levels of denial were terrifying. He genuinely has no idea that he and the Tories are the establishment. That they have been running the country for the past 13 years. It’s as though he believes the government has been under the control of some unspecified blob. The lengths he will go to absolve himself of any responsibility. Having made the introductory speech, he went on to introduce the person who would be introducing the main speaker. Step forward the formidably dim Miriam Cates. Fresh from her Today programme car wreck that morning in which she didn’t seem to know that social care workers were not part of the NHS nor have any clue how much she thought they ought to be earning. And she is meant to be the brains of the operation. But hey ho. Cates is the woman many Tories see as the future of the party. Which may just be an indication that most Conservatives see their own extinction as inevitable. Someone you could almost guarantee to reach the wrong conclusion on almost everything. She, too, wanted to take back control. The Tories had made a promise to keep migration to 229,000 and now it was three times that. And the New Conservatives had a cunning plan to reverse that. Just stop foreigners coming in. Say no to Johnny Foreigner. It was time to make our borders “culturally secure”. We had to end our addiction to cheap labour and get Britons to fill all the vacancies in social care and the NHS. And we should just pay them more. She didn’t seem to have heard of the doctors and nurses going on strike. Her own government’s inflation targets. Or that most Britons didn’t want to do these jobs at any price the government was willing to pay. Her ignorance was total. It would have been shameless, were she on nodding terms with any concept of shame. Still, any Tory fringe event always has an element of comedy, and Cates was happy to oblige. Nor would she be the last laugh on offer. Next up was Tom Hunt, the Tory MP who had come up with the new immigration plan. He tried to be reasonable. First, he wanted to dispel the notion that he was a Tory rebel. He wasn’t. He adored Rish! more than life itself. It wasn’t that his plan was a criticism of the government’s policy. Rather, the government had just got a bit confused and he wanted to help out. And do anything to try to protect his seat at the next election. Hell, if it meant doubling inflation, closing universities, bankrupting the health and social care sector and sparking a recession to get down the number of immigrants, then it was a price worth paying. Yet again it was the liberal elite who were holding us back, said Hunt. Who also went to Oxford. “I worked in a radish-sorting factory where I was the only Brit,” he claimed nostalgically. Man of the people. Shame he didn’t decide to make that holiday job a full-time career. “People shouldn’t feel that any job is beneath them,” he added. Present company excepted. Last to speak was the permanently angry James Daly. He’s yet to find an issue on which he doesn’t want to pick a fight. It was all the Blob. The establishment. The Guardian. Another Tory MP who thinks Labour is in power. All he had ever wanted was to be helpful. And the best service he could offer Sunak right now was to spark another civil war. It’s what the party needed. He loved the Conservatives so much he’d do anything to make sure they were never elected again. The Q&amp;A that followed descended into chaos as everyone doubled down on their stupidity. It’s not often that Kruger finds himself the brightest person on a panel and he did his best to distance himself from his colleagues. He’d realised too late he was yet again on the wrong side of history. There was nothing to be gained by being the No Mark’s No Mark. Cates continued to increase wage inflation with every sentence. Any price was worth paying to get rid of foreigners. Hunt couldn’t quite work out why Labour was 20 points ahead in the polls when Sunak was doing such a great job. No one thought to enlighten him. Daly merely got angrier and angrier. Picking fights with Rish!, the media and himself. Eventually Kruger called time. It had all been much ado about nothing. The New Conservatives had no more clue than the Old Conservatives. All they had done was highlight yet more divisions within the Tory party. Rats in a sack. Fighting to the death. A theatre of the absurd for which the country is paying."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/09/labour-win-power-party-strategy-ideas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-09T11:05:42Z","webTitle":"This narrow, win-at-all-costs strategy could take Labour to victory, but not to power |  Neal Lawson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/labour-win-power-party-strategy-ideas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/labour-win-power-party-strategy-ideas","fields":{"bodyText":"How can a party be convincingly leading the polls and still appear so weak? Labour may be 17 points ahead but it continues to behave with all the nervousness of unwelcome gatecrashers at a party. Here it does no good to be unfair. On some impressive and yet rather cynical scale Labour has worked miracles. It has come back from the dead much quicker than anyone expected. Keir Starmer was meant to be the bridge for the eventual return of Blairite true believers. Under the temporary cloak of Corbynism-without-Corbyn, the plan was not to win but to snatch the party back – a first step, and one that counted on another electoral failure as an inevitability, given the scale of Labour’s 2019 loss. What no one saw coming was the utter collapse of the Tory governing project, first via Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss. Rishi Sunak, thus far, seems unable to do much but prolong the agony. Probable victory is being handed to Labour on a plate – and herein lies the problem. A schism is opening within Labour between those who believe winning the next election under almost any circumstances is the only objective of the next 18 months of politics, versus those that want electoral success but with a purpose and a mandate. The two sides stare at each other aghast. “How could you not see winning is everything?” decries one camp – nothing matters more than getting rid of the terrible Tories. This strategy provides the smallest possible target for the Tories and their media allies to take aim at. A victory based on this strategy would be an unprecedented success story given the scale of 2019’s defeat. So why does it feel that outside a narrowing leadership circle, so few party members and supporters seem happy with this state of affairs? On the other side of this minimalist stance is a deep and profound worry that while electoral success is necessary, it is far from sufficient. Electoral success at any cost simply ties the hands of any incoming government. Set against enormous environmental and economic challenges, the looming danger is that Labour could be busy constructing a cage for itself from any victory that relies on Tory ineptitude. If Labour wins office but fails to capitalise on the opportunity, the fear is not just that progressive politics will be damaged, perhaps irrevocably, but that people start to turn away from democracy itself. In the short term, even attempting to win on this narrow ticket is fraught with danger. If everything rests on continued governing failure, what happens if the Tories stop failing? What if the economy ticks upwards enough, and their relentless anti-woke and anti-boat agenda takes hold? Labour has too little to come back with. Labour or a Labour-led alliance must win office, but it also needs to be in power. Being in office means taking executive decisions, being in power is the wherewithal to decisively intervene and transform the country. Such power is based on a vision for change, a mandate to achieve it, the deep-rooted policies and institutions that can oversee the gradual but systematic transformation of our economy and society, and the alliances to defend and promote the politics of big change. By luck, all the above helps Labour electorally too. Instead of an either/or approach to office and power, Labour needs to adopt a both/and position. Here we should make a plea for the return of the much-maligned word “pragmatism”. A pragmatic politics is an approach that evaluates theories or beliefs in terms of the success of their practical application. To be pragmatic is to know where you want to go but act cannily to get there. Pragmatic politics is about starting where people are, connecting or reconnecting with them, but knowing in a profound sense where you want to take them. It’s about the steady building blocks of change so that gradually, step by step, progressives become stronger, winning over people and political ground. It is a base to build from, not a deep hole to get out of. Governments alone are not powerful. Just look at the Tories with their 62-seat majority. Ideas and movements are powerful and can be transformative when they chime with emerging cultures, technology and elected office. Just being there is not enough. Starmer says he wants to fix things, not theorise. But fix what, for whom and how? These are deeply political decisions that demand hard thought and profound answers. Of course, this is not easy. It is neither impossibilism nor capitulation and therefore requires deep strategic thought and planning, which appears to be somewhat lacking. I should know, I’ve been here before. After the soul-crushing 1992 defeat, I too slipped dreamlike into the false comfort of the win-at-any-cost camp. But New Labour was the product of more profound loss, not just that 1992 election defeat, but the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, the defeat of the miners in 1985, of socialist hope. In such systemic and disorientating loss, the only salvation seemed to be electoral victory, at any cost. There I slept until a double epiphany in the shape of sociologists Stuart Hall and Zygmunt Bauman woke me from my slumber and set me back on the long road to power with a deep purpose. And I’ve been here more recently still. In the wake of the Jeremy Corbyn leadership victory in 2015, I remember a young activist telling me not to raise questions, or dredge up difficult problems. Instead, they said, I should just believe and support the new leader. At that early moment I knew the Corbyn project would struggle. Labour is running for high office, but it feels too much like it is running from everything, from the climate catastrophe and the fact so many cannot afford the cost of living. It is running from itself and its lack of depth and confidence. As Labour shrinks its offer and its base before it’s even in office, it feels as if some who lead it can only look down, never up. This spells disaster. An improbable victory is being handed to Labour on a plate – but the gruel is thin. Too thin.

What to pack for an overseas work trip? For Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty’s visit to the G7 summit in Japan, the conundrum runs much deeper than whether they should share a suitcase. The duo may not have had to grapple with a limited baggage allowance, but as one of Britain’s wealthiest couples, and with everything they say as well as wear scrutinised, they do need to get a careful grip on the optics surrounding their fashion choices. Murty, who has until recently kept a low public profile, seems to be using the trip to showcase a new pragmatic approach to dressing. Gone are the £590 designer slippers and £1,650 Valentino leather coats. In their place, a range of labels, many from British brands. Descending the steps of a British Airways plane as the couple landed in Tokyo, Murty wore two British brands, a £275 bright pink cashmere top from Chinti &amp; Parker and neon green tailored trousers from Me+Em. Later, boarding a plane to travel to Hiroshima, she was pictured in a £675 sage coloured dress from the British brand Joseph, and carried a £375 mini bag from the Edinburgh-based brand Strathberry. Sunak appears to be sticking to his uniform of neat suiting, crisp white shirts and primary coloured ties. The Prada footwear is still there, too. However, this is also a carefully considered choice. Last August, at a Tory hustings in Darlington he was accused of “deliberately dressing down” when he wore shoes with a visible hole in the sole. Much safer this time around to stick to his tried and tested designer pieces and employ a cost per wear approach. There is a fine line between relatability and cosplay, which explains why we’ve seen Murty, a billionaire heiress, in an £85 blouse from Boden and £150 midi skirt from the French it-brand Sézane but have yet to see her in something from M&amp;S. Fashion insiders say Murty’s new power-dressing approach has been deployed after advice from the fashion consultant Isabel Spearman. Spearman was previously employed as a special adviser to Samantha Cameron during her husband’s tenure at 10 Downing Street. While Spearman hasn’t confirmed her involvement, Murty’s new arsenal of high/low brands is a strategy Cameron also embraced, with a wardrobe spanning Zara to Burberry. It’s an approach adopted by other political spouses, too. Michelle Obama regularly wore high-street brands such as J.Crew alongside designer labels such as Alexander McQueen, while Carrie Johnson rented much of her designer wardrobe. Murty has a natural interest in fashion, too, having previously helmed her own label, Akshata. “Ever since I was a little girl, I have always loved clothes,” she told Vogue India in 2011. “My mother, a no-nonsense engineer, was always baffled why I would spend so much time creating different outfits from my wardrobe.” So far, the brands Murty has chosen have reported a surge in demand. Her Rixo dress is sold out, while the Shropshire based-designer Claire Mischevani, who created Murty’s blue coronation dress, has had to add a disclaimer to her website, warning of delayed deliveries due to unprecedented orders. However, it’s Sunak who has caused the first item from a Japanese brand to sell out. On Thursday night, removing his shoes before a dinner with Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, as is customary in Japan, Sunak drew attention to his red socks emblazoned with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp logo, Kishida’s favourite baseball team. From a local shop in Hiroshima, they cost £8. After the pictures emerged the socks sold out in the red colour, both online and in-store."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:20:57Z","webTitle":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear energy watchdog has said the forces behind the shelling of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant are “playing with fire”, after a series of explosions shook the facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has experts based at Zaporizhzhia, reported on Sunday that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. It said its on-site experts saw some of the explosions from their windows. It reported more than a dozen blasts from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none so far critical for nuclear safety”. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said the news was extremely disturbing and he called the explosions completely unacceptable. “Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire,” he said. According to the IAEA Twitter account, Grossi renewed his appeal to Ukraine and Russia to agree and implement a nuclear safety and security zone around the plant as soon as possible. Zaporizhzhia, in south-east Ukraine, is Europe’s largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since March, although its Ukrainian staff remain in place to run the facility. It has faced repeated shelling, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. The plant’s six Soviet-designed water-cooled reactors are currently shut down, but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power that drives the cooling systems is shut. Shelling has frequently damaged the plant’s power supply. Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian forces were behind the latest attacks. “They are shelling not only yesterday but also today, they are shelling even now,” an adviser to the head of Russia’s nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, told the Russian state news agency Tass. He said there had been 15 aerial strikes, including one that hit a storage facility. Soon after the Russian accusations, Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom, said Russia was responsible for the shelling, which it said had resulted in 12 hits to Zaporizhzhia’s infrastructure. The company said on Telegram that the list of damaged equipment indicated that the attackers “targeted and disabled exactly the infrastructure that was necessary for the restart of 5th and 6th power units” and the restoration of power production for Ukrainian needs. Ukraine faces a collapse in its electricity supply after a relentless Russian bombing campaign targeted at power infrastructure. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has previously called for all troops to leave the plant so that it is under full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers. His government has called the attacks on the plant false-flag operations by Russia. Elsewhere in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces shelled civilian infrastructure in about a dozen communities, destroying 30 homes, the Ukrainian presidential office said on Sunday. Ukraine’s defence ministry published figures claiming that 84,210 Russian soldiers had been “eliminated” since the war began, including 330 in the last 24 hours. Ukraine also claimed Russia had lost 2,886 tanks, 5,817 armoured vehicles and 278 military jets. Separately, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine and Russia decline to publish their own military casualty figures, but earlier this month a senior US general estimated there had been “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded”, and a similar number on the Ukrainian side. Meanwhile, Ukraine promised to investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but that it was “very unlikely” the clips showed what Russia claimed, Associated Press reported. The UN’s human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has called for further investigation, which Stefanishyna said Ukraine had “no problem” with. On Sunday, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency said negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”. Mykhailo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given the series of major military victories achieved by Kyiv. “Any conspiracy theories about ‘surrender’ or west’s secret negotiations with Putin do not take into account ‘small detail’. Ukrainians,” he tweeted. “Ukraine will not kneel to Russians. It is not a matter of politics. It is a matter of our existence.” His statement follows recent US media reports that some senior US officials have privately told Kyiv to be open to negotiations with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2023/jul/02/it-was-an-accident-the-scientists-who-have-turned-humid-air-into-renewable-power","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-02T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘It was an accident’: the scientists who have turned humid air into renewable power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/02/it-was-an-accident-the-scientists-who-have-turned-humid-air-into-renewable-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/jul/02/it-was-an-accident-the-scientists-who-have-turned-humid-air-into-renewable-power","fields":{"bodyText":"In the early 20th century, Serbian inventor Nikola Tesla dreamed of pulling limitless free electricity from the air around us. Ever ambitious, Tesla was thinking on a vast scale, effectively looking at the Earth and upper atmosphere as two ends of an enormous battery. Needless to say, his dreams were never realised, but the promise of air-derived electricity – hygroelectricity – is now capturing researchers’ imaginations again. The difference: they’re not thinking big, but very, very small. In May, a team at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst published a paper declaring they had successfully generated a small but continuous electric current from humidity in the air. It’s a claim that will probably raise a few eyebrows, and when the team made the discovery that inspired this new research in 2018, it did. “To be frank, it was an accident,” says the study’s lead author, Prof Jun Yao. “We were actually interested in making a simple sensor for humidity in the air. But for whatever reason, the student who was working on that forgot to plug in the power.” The UMass Amherst team were surprised to find that the device, which comprised an array of microscopic tubes, or nanowires, was producing an electrical signal regardless. Each nanowire was less than one-thousandth the diameter of a human hair, wide enough that an airborne water molecule could enter, but so narrow it would bump around inside the tube. Each bump, the team realised, lent the material a small charge, and as the frequency of bumps increased, one end of the tube became differently charged from the other. “So it’s really like a battery,” says Yao. “You have a positive pull and a negative pull, and when you connect them the charge is going to flow.” For their recent study, Yao’s team have moved on from nanowires, and instead are punching materials with millions of tiny holes, or nanopores. The device they have come up with is the size of a thumbnail, one-fifth the width of a human hair, and capable of generating roughly one microwatt – enough to light a single pixel on a large LED screen. So what would it take to power the rest of the screen, or indeed a whole house? “The beauty is that the air is everywhere,” says Yao. “Even though a thin sheet of the device gives out a very tiny amount of electricity or power, in principle, we can stack multiple layers in vertical space to increase the power.” That’s exactly what another team, Prof Svitlana Lyubchyk and her twin sons, Profs Andriy and Sergiy Lyubchyk, are trying to do. Svitlana Lyubchyk and Andriy are part of the Lisbon-based Catcher project, whose aim is “changing atmospheric humidity into renewable power”, and along with Sergiy they have founded CascataChuva, a startup intended to commercialise the research. They first began working on the idea in 2015, some time before Yao’s team at the UMass Amherst. “We were considered the freaks,” says Andriy. “The guys who were saying something completely impossible.” In fact, trying to prove the worth of an early proof-of-concept at conferences had them literally red in the face. He says: “The signal was not stable and it was low. We were able to generate 300 milliwatts, but you had to put all your effort into your lungs in order to breathe enough humidity into the samples.” They’ve come a long way since then, with Catcher and related projects receiving nearly €5.5m (£4.7m) in funding from the European Innovation Council. The result is a thin grey disc measuring 4cm (1.5in) across. According to the Lyubchyks, one of these devices can generate a relatively modest 1.5 volts and 10 milliamps. However, 20,000 of them stacked into a washing machine-sized cube, they say, could generate 10 kilowatt hours of energy a day – roughly the consumption of an average UK household. Even more impressive: they plan to have a prototype ready for demonstration in 2024. A device that can generate usable electricity from thin (or somewhat muggy) air may sound too good to be true, but Peter Dobson, emeritus professor of engineering science at Oxford University, has been following both the UMass Amherst and Catcher teams’ research, and he’s optimistic. “When I first heard about it, I thought: ‘Oh yes, another one of those.’ But no, it’s got legs, this one has,” says Dobson. “If you can engineer and scale it, and avoid the thing getting contaminated by atmospheric microbes, it should work.” He goes on to suggest that preventing microbial contamination is more an “exciting engineering challenge” than a terminal flaw, but there are far greater problems to overcome before this technology is powering our homes. “How do these devices get manufactured?” asks Anna Korre, professor of environmental engineering at Imperial College London. “Sourcing raw materials, costing, assessing the environmental footprint, and scaling them up for implementation takes time and conviction.” Even once the remaining challenge of connecting thousands of these devices together has been overcome, cost remains a significant issue. “All new technologies for energy need to think of the ‘green premium’,” says Colin Price, a professor of geophysics at Tel Aviv University, referring to the additional cost of choosing a clean technology over one that emits more greenhouse gases. “The green premiums are huge at the moment for this technology, but hopefully would be reduced by R&amp;D [research and development], investments, tax breaks for clean energies and levies on dirty energies.” The Lyubchyks estimate that the levelised cost of energy – the average net present cost of electricity generation for a generator over its lifetime – from these devices will indeed be high at first, but by moving into mass production, they hope to lower it significantly, ultimately making this hygroelectric power competitive with solar and wind. For that to work, though, they’ll need investment, access to raw materials and the equipment to process them. While the UMass Amherst researchers are working with organic materials, which in theory can be produced with relative ease, the Catcher team have achieved superior results using zirconium oxide – a material of interest in fuel cell research. The Lyubchyks had hoped to establish a supply from their native Ukraine, which has rich deposits, but Russia’s continuing full-scale invasion of the country has forced them for the time being to work with relatively small amounts bought from China. The team accept that it may take years to optimise a prototype and scale up production, but if they’re successful, the benefits are clear. Unlike solar or wind, hygroelectric generators could work day and night, indoors and out, and in many places. The team even hope one day to make construction materials from their devices. “Imagine you can construct parts of a building using this material,” Andriy says. “There’s no need to transfer the energy, no need for infrastructure.” It may all seem like blue-sky thinking, and Tesla’s dreams of limitless electricity from the air are still a long way off, but Yao suggests we may find grounds for optimism among cloudier skies. “Lots of energy is stored in water molecules in the air,” he says. “That’s where we get the lightning effect during a thunderstorm. The existence of this type of energy isn’t in doubt. It’s about how we collect it.” • This article was amended on 6 July 2023.

There’s a full moon over the olive grove where the Master Musicians have cut out a flat area as a stage, and tonight it is covered in carpets beneath a green and red patterned awning. The musicians are dressed in turbans and black embroidered djellaba robes, and all are seated apart from their elected leader, Ahmed El Attar, a drummer who parades in before them, driving on an intricate, improvised and trance-inducing dance music that continues without stop for hour after hour. This ancient artistry, stretching back over a thousand years, is powerful and complex; the musicians say it is spiritual, bringing a blessing, baraka, to those who listen. There are four percussionists, beating out constantly changing polyrhythms on their goatskin drums, the small zowak and larger farad, and alongside them are eight woodwind players, blowing into their reed ghaitas. The lead player and two companions establish a riff, others respond or embellish the melody or use circular breathing to add drone effects to music that is constantly developing, creating phasing effects as it builds from crescendo to crescendo. Suddenly, the lights go out, a bonfire is blazing in the field by the stage, and Boujeloud, the Pan god appears, dancing around the flames, quivering from head to foot, brandishing olive branches as he chases village children before leaping on stage with the band. By day, Mohamed El Hatmi is a 71-year-old cafe owner but once he puts on his costume, made from the skins of four black goats, he is a man possessed. It’s a role he has played for more than 50 years. This is the finale of the world’s smallest annual music festival. Only 50 people, including organisers and guests, can attend, so as not to disrupt village life, and Joujouka fans have come here from all over the world. A third are from Japan, where the band have toured and played a reportedly frenzied five-hour set at an EDM festival, while others have flown in from Los Angeles, France and the UK. After three days and nights of this intense music, with lengthy sessions always starting after midnight, everyone has got to know each other. There is still no running water in the village, and alcohol is not allowed. We all stay in the houses of the musicians, whose wives provide breakfast, and the musicians themselves help cook and serve lunch and dinner, served on the stage where they will later be playing. In the afternoons there are sessions with oud or violin players. Joujouka is a farming community perched on a ridge with a patchwork of fields and olive orchards below. There are more donkeys and chickens on the one street than there are cars. It may look like a typical north African village, but it has an extraordinary musical history. El Hatmi takes visitors across a valley to the mountain cave where Boujeloud, a creature who was half-man and half-goat, was said to have first taught flute playing to a shepherd, in the hope of getting a wife in return. He failed, but the villagers became such great musicians that Boujeloud was pacified, bringing health, fertility and good crops to the village. That ancient myth lives on. The festival is organised by Frank Rynne, once a musician in Dublin, where he first met members of the Joujouka band, and now a Paris-based academic historian. He has studied the Boujeloud story and argues “he is absolutely derived from Pan. Look at the depictions of Pan in Pompeii with his pan pipes – and the Romans were here. This is a pre-Islamic belief that has kept going. The villagers believe that the huge fire that destroyed olive groves here last year happened because there had been no Boujeloud festivals – they had been stopped by Covid.” Islam also influenced the music. In the early 15th century, Sufi saint Sidi Ahmed Sheich came here, realised the power of the music and taught the musicians to play a style that Rynne says “would act like a surgical instrument on the brain to help heal people from depression”. Joujouka flourished. Some musicians travelled to Fez to play for the Sultan (a lucrative gig that ended with the colonial era: the French were in Fez, the Spanish in Joujouka, and the musicians weren’t able to cross the new colonial borders). Others stayed in the village to play to the sick who flocked here to be cured. When I first came here in 1973, musical healing ceremonies were still being held in the ancient shrine to the saint in the centre of the village. The shrine remains, still dominated by an old fig tree, but it’s now deserted. With Rynne translating from the Arabic, I ask El Attar what had gone wrong. There has been a clash between the old Sufi tradition and modern Islam, and they have been banned from playing there: “The authorities say it shouldn’t happen because there is a mosque across the road.” But he says the music still has the same power and they still treat the sick in private: “Five weeks ago we played for someone who came to us with a djinn [a malicious African spirit] in his brain”. He and other musicians break into a furious burst of hand clapping as they demonstrate the difference between “the Boujeloud rhythms, for dancing” and the healing music written by the saint. There’s another, more recent figure in the village mythology – Rolling Stone Brian Jones, who recorded here in 1968, a year before his death, and was said to be obsessed by the music. After Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka was released in 1971 the village attracted more celebrities. When I was first invited here there was still no electricity, the musicians were playing on the mud square, but the guests included William Burroughs and Ornette Coleman. Rikki Stein – later Fela Kuti’s manager – had been living here for two years, and in 1980 he organised passports for the band, and bought a bus for their first European tour, lasting three months. Stein is back this year and noted “the music has the same energy and dynamism I experienced in the 1970s – though the number of musicians has reduced”. It’s a glorious story – but with one sour edge. Bachir Attar, the son of one of Joujouka’s best-loved musicians, runs a rival band called The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar. He speaks English (unlike the Joujouka musicians), has lived in New York, played with the Rolling Stones on Steel Wheels in 1989, with Ornette Coleman at his London Meltdown in 2009, and won a gold medal from the Kennedy Centre for the performing arts this year. Which is all fine – there is surely room for two bands from the region? But Bachir, who has a house in the village but was not in evidence during the festival, claims his band are the “authentic Master Musicians … not to be confused with any imitations”. And that has caused major problems. Rynne says he started the festival in Joujouka to prove that these really are the village musicians, and was delighted that Brian Jones’s former partner Anita Pallenberg came along to the first event in 2008. So what do the Joujouka musicians think of Bachir’s music? “It’s popular music, not the ancient music of Joujouka,” says El Attar. “But let him do what he wants. Anyone who comes here and sees what we do knows what the story is.” And it’s the Master Musicians of Joujouka, not Jajouka, who will be at Glastonbury, where they last played in 2011. They are clearly excited to be going, especially the three band members who have never been outside Morocco before. “We loved it,” said El Attar. “We had no wellington boots until someone gave them to us. Boujeloud music brings blessings.” “People want the baraka, the healing power,” adds the ghaita player Abdeslam Rrtoubi. “This music is ancient. It will never die.” • The Master Musicians of Joujouka play London Forge, 20-21 June, and Glastonbury 23 June (Pyramid stage, noon)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
