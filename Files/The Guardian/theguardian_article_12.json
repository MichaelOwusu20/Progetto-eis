Thanks for following along. Here is a summary of today’s events: Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has reacted to Russia’s plans in Belarus by calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described Russia’s plans to station nuclear weapons in Belarus as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory. Borrell tweeted: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged following an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Law enforcement has attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast. Putin stated that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023, Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research by Thomson Reuters. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Several buildings were damaged but no one was injured following the detonation of a naval mine that hit some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to the Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. The United States has not seen any indication that Russia has yet moved nuclear weapons to its neighbor Belarus, national security council spokesman John Kirby said Sunday, according to AFP. “We have not seen any indication that he (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around,” Kirby told CBS. Three people were reported injured following the explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, which law enforcement has attributed to a Ukrainian drone. “A Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV was the cause of an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk, Tula region,” the Tass news agency quoted a law enforcement agency source as saying, according to Reuters. “The drone was packed with explosives.” None of the people hurt in the blast are believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons on its territory, warning the move may trigger additional sanctions. In a Sunday tweet, Borrell said: “#Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation &amp; threat to European security.” “Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice,” he added. “The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” On Saturday, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement reached with Belarus will see Moscow stationing tactical nuclear weapons on its smaller neighbors’ territory. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. More details are emerging about the reported explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region, where two people suffered shrapnel wounds. The crater was caused by a drone, the Tass news agency quoted law enforcement as saying, Reuters reports. Three residential buildings were also damaged following the explosion, a regional security agency said. More reaction from Kyiv on plans by Russian president Vladimir Putin to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. In a statement, Kyiv’s foreign ministry described it as “another provocative step” by Moscow that undermines “the international security system as a whole”. The ministry said: Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible steward of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation. It demanded a UN security council session and called on the Group of Seven countries and the European Union to warn Belarus of “far-reaching consequences” if it accepts the Russian weapons. The Ukrainian statement added: Ukraine calls on all members of the international community to convey to the criminal (P)utin regime the categorical unacceptability of its next nuclear provocations and to take decisive measures to effectively deter and prevent any possibility of the aggressor state’s use of nuclear weapons. Two people have suffered shrapnel wounds following an explosion on Sunday in the town of Kireyevsk, about 220km (140 miles) south of Moscow, the Tass news agency cited emergency services as saying. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known, but it left a crater in the centre of the town, in the Tula region, Reuters reports. “The explosion sounded at 1519 (1219 GMT). Two victims, born in 2002 and 2006, have shrapnel wounds. Emergency services are on the scene,” Tass quoted a local emergency services representative as saying. “There is a crater. This explosion was in the heart of the city,” the representative added. The representative said the injuries were not life-threatening and that investigators were working at the site. Several nearby buildings were damaged but no one was injured after a naval mine detonated after hitting some some coastline facilities in Odesa, according to Odesa city council. The Kyiv Independent quoted authorities as saying that no one was injured. Ukraine fans have been gathering near Wembley, in north London, ahead of this evening’s UEFA Euro 2024 Group C qualifying match against England: It is just after 4pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of events so far. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. Kyiv has said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports.

Ukraine has called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations’ Security Council over Russia’s announcement that it would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said: Ukraine expects effective actions to counteract the Kremlin’s nuclear blackmail from the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France... We demand that an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council be immediately convened for this purpose. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric, a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reports. A Nato spokesperson said on Sunday: Nato is vigilant, and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments, most recently suspending its participation in the New START Treaty. The Associated Press reports on a new recruitment campaign launched across Russia seeking volunteers to enlist troops for the war in Ukraine. Advertisements promise cash bonuses and enticing benefits. Recruiters are making cold calls to eligible men. Enlistment offices are working with universities and social service agencies to lure students and the unemployed. A new campaign is under way this spring across Russia, seeking recruits to replenish its troops for the war in Ukraine. As fighting grinds on in Ukrainian battlegrounds like Bakhmut and both sides prepare for counter-offensives that could cost even more lives, the Kremlin’s war machine badly needs new recruits. A mobilisation in September of 300,000 reservists – billed as a “partial” call-up – sent panic throughout the country, since most men under 65 are formally part of the reserve. Tens of thousands fled Russia rather than report to recruiting stations. The Kremlin denies that another call-up is planned for what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, now more than a year old. But amid widespread uncertainty of whether such a move will eventually happen, the government is enticing men to volunteer, either at makeshift recruiting centres popping up in various regions, or with phone calls from enlistment officials. That way, it can “avoid declaring a formal second mobilisation wave” after the first one proved so unpopular, according to a recent report by the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War. One Muscovite told the Associated Press that his employer, a state-funded organisation, gathered up the military registration cards of all male employees of fighting age and said it would get them deferments. But he said the move still sent a wave of fear through him. “It makes you nervous and scared – no one wants to all of a sudden end up in a war with a rifle in their hands,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. “The special operation is somewhat dragging on, so any surprises from the Russian authorities can be expected.” Former Russian state TV editor Marina Ovsyannikova, who in 2022 interrupted a live news broadcast denouncing the Ukraine war, has said her son called her a “traitor” for her actions, adding that she may never be able to return to Russia. Ukrainian-born Ovsyannikova, who was an editor at Channel One, burst on to the set of the nightly news in March 2022 shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign saying: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English: “Russians against the war.” At the time, she was fined 30,000 roubles (£460) for ignoring protest laws. She continued protesting against the war after quitting her job at Channel One. Last August, she was charged with spreading false information about the Russian army for holding up a poster that read “Putin is a murderer, his soldiers are fascists” during a solo protest on the Moskva River embankment opposite the Kremlin. She was subsequently forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet and placed under house arrest in Moscow, where she was to await trial. She faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. However, she escaped her pre-trial house arrest and fled to Europe. She now lives in Paris, France, with her daughter. Shortly after she left Russia, she said her son had told her that her decision to protest had ruined the family’s life. She told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: My son still called me a traitor, that I betrayed our family. I betrayed our country. I can say that for millions of families [this] is the same situation – war ruins a lot of families. And this is a real catastrophe because Russians have been destroyed by Putin, not only physically by him sending them to war but also on a psychological level. Russia is now deep in depression, there is an apathy everywhere and millions of people just don’t know what the future holds. When asked if she thought it would ever be safe for her to return to Russia, she said: I can’t go back now. But I do see my future with Russia. My son is there, my family is there, my mum, and they don’t want to leave the country. For me, I am not indifferent to the future of this country and I will fight for the future even being outside of Russia. Ovsyannikova said she was “ashamed” of Russia for invading Ukraine and recalling how she had “mixed emotions” before she made the 2022 protest, she explained: A lot of factors came together. Over a long time I realised that the Russian TV became like a gigantic brainwashing machine. Secondly, I have Ukrainian roots – my father is from Ukraine. It was like this huge emotional outburst. But I didn’t really care what would happen to me later.” Ovsyannikova had worked at the channel for nearly 20 years and admitted she had in the past “shut my eyes to it [the propaganda]”, but the war became “a point of no return”. She said: This propaganda is made on a very high level …These people who are working in the main media channels, they don’t really believe it. They have similar views to me, and also, you can say that people who are pro-Putin, who are convinced in him, as no more than 10 or 20%. The arrest warrant handed to President Putin by the international criminal court could herald change, she added: I think this is the first signal that the Russian elite should take notice of, and perhaps some kind of resistance will start within the Russian elite and they might plot against him. At least this is some kind of hope for me. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak has accused Vladimir Putin of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and resorting to “scare” tactics. On Saturday, Putin announced Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in neighbour and ally Belarus “without violating our international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation”, Agence France-Presse reports. But Podolyak said on Twitter: Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics … Second. He once again states his involvement in the crime. Violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty … Ukrainian refugees are increasingly being targeted for sexual exploitation with an increase in interest in pornography claiming to feature refugees from the war-torn country, according to research. Thomson Reuters has conducted the research, which has found that Ukrainian refugees may be victims of both traffickers on the ground and cyber-voyeurs. Researchers identified an increased interest in Ukrainian pornography since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 by analysing global internet search engine traffic. They believe the increased interest online may be encouraging traffickers to act more often and with greater impunity. The organisation has called for urgent action to strengthen protections to help keep Ukrainian women and children who are at risk from sexual exploitation safe. The analysis of internet search trends has found views of pornographic videos claiming to show Ukrainian refugees have exploded in the past six months. A snapshot of 13 pornographic videos claiming to feature Ukrainian refugees shows they were viewed 275,000 times in January. While there was evidence of sexual exploitation and trafficking of some Ukrainians before the war started, the latest data shows a significant increase since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide search traffic for exploitative terms such as “Ukrainian porn” have been consistently at higher levels since the February 2022 invasion. Thomson Reuters is working with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to raise awareness about this sexual exploitation. They have partnered to launch the “Be Safe” campaign to encourage the global community to provide Ukrainians with safety information and to help them to spot the warning signs of traffickers. Valiant Richey, the OSCE special representative and coordinator for combating trafficking in human beings, said: “This analysis shows just how crucial it is to keep women and children fleeing the war safe. The high demand from men for sexual access to Ukrainian women and girls creates an enormous incentive for traffickers to recruit vulnerable people in order to meet that demand and profit from it. “We already found direct evidence of recruitment attempts on chats used by Ukrainians and an increase in the advertisement of Ukrainians online.” The new data is based on “interest scores”, which relate directly to search traffic and compare a term’s popularity over a specific period. Earlier analysis in 2022 found that global internet searches for sexually exploitative terms specifically relating to Ukrainian refugees surged following the outbreak of the war. In March 2022, research found a 300% global increase in these terms. You can read the full report here. Here are some images coming to us over the wires. Here’s some more on football. Later on Sunday, Ukraine take on England at the UK’s Wembley Stadium in a qualifying match for the men’s Euro 2024 football competition. UK ministers offered 1,000 free tickets to Ukrainians and their sponsors to attend the match at Wembley. Denys Dreyzer, 18, from Kherson, fled Ukraine in May 2022 and came to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. He and his family have since moved out from their hosts' home. Dreyzer, who works as caretaker for the Ukrainian Community Centre and is studying at the University of Bolton, will attend the game with his mother and sister, who he lives with in Bradford. His father is in Kyiv. Discussing the match, he told PA News: I hope it will be amazing, because it’s like new fresh air to our community to watch our guys fighting to get to the Euros. We hope this game our guys will show what we can do. And also it will be good present for our military, because they are every day fighting for our freedom. I hope they will watch this game and this game will will make them happy. The Azadi Stadium in Tehran can hold up to 78,000 at capacity. As Anton Miranchuk of Lokomotiv Moscow kicked off under a giant portrait of the former supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini on Thursday night, let’s generously say it wasn’t quite full. Still, what crowd there was made a pretty decent noise. There were even a few hundred travelling fans, who were rewarded when Miranchuk scored for Russia from the penalty spot. Early in the second half the Porto striker Mehdi Taremi equalised for Iran, and although the later stages disintegrated into a procession of substitutions, the visitors were ultimately a little fortunate to escape with a 1-1 draw. Honours even on the pitch, then, which felt like a diplomatically fitting result. Over the past year, as the west has begun to close ranks, these two pariah states have found themselves locked in a pragmatic but increasingly enthusiastic embrace. Russian money has been pouring into Iranian mining and infrastructure projects, to the point where it is now Iran’s largest source of foreign investment. Iran has invited Russian businesspeople to Tehran to share advice on circumventing western sanctions. The two countries have linked their banking systems and embarked on joint naval drills. And last month the Russian and Iranian sports ministers signed a “memorandum of mutual understanding”, vowing to strengthen their sporting ties. On Sunday evening, Ukraine’s footballers will step out at Wembley Stadium to a vivid fanfare: a sea of flags and bold gestures, an outpouring of affection and solidarity that has greeted them pretty much everywhere they have travelled in the last year. At exactly the same time, in St Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, Russia will play Iraq in their first national team game on home soil since the start of last year’s war. Good luck finding the game on television or tracking down a match report on the Fifa website. But seamlessly, almost imperceptibly, Russia has returned to the international football treadmill, and nobody seems overly perturbed by it. Even Ukraine, who called for Iran to be thrown out of last year’s World Cup for its role in supplying drones to the Russian war effort, has in this instance opted for apathy over outrage. “Those countries who play Russia, an aggressor, support Russian aggression and what Russia is doing to Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s caretaker manager, Ruslan Rotan, last week. “We don’t have to think about those countries, we don’t have to pay attention to them. They are not worthy. The bottom line is, forget Russia.” Read the full report here. Russia and China are not creating a military alliance, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in a televised interview broadcast on Sunday, stating that the two countries’ military cooperation was transparent, news agencies reported. Putin also said western powers were building a new “axis”, bearing some resemblance to Germany and Japan’s second world war alliance. Interfax quoted Putin as saying: We are not creating any military alliance with China. Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret. Kyiv on Sunday said Russia was holding Minsk as a “nuclear hostage” after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to ally Belarus, Agence France-Presse reports. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, Oleksiy Danilov, wrote on Twitter, adding that the move was “a step towards the internal destabilisation of the country”. The UK Ministry of Defence says that since the start of March 2023 Russia is likely to have launched at least 71 Iranian-designed Shahed series one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicle (OWA-UAVS) against targets across Ukraine. It says Russia is likely launching Shaheds from two axes: from Russia’s Krasnodar Krai in the east and from Bryansk Oblast in the north-east. Ukraine will no longer resort to “dangerous” monetary financing to fund the war against Russia, its central bank governor, Andriy Pyshnyi, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday. The head of the National Bank of Ukraine said that it had “created huge risks for macro-financial stability” when the bank was last year forced to print billions of hryvnia to plug a budget shortfall, adding that an “open conflict” with the government over the issue had been resolved. “It was a quick remedy, but very dangerous,” Pyshnyi told the newspaper. Reactions continue on Vladimir Putin’s announcement Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. “It’s a very significant move,” Nikolai Sokov, a senior fellow at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told Reuters. “Russia had always been very proud that it had no nuclear weapons outside its territory. So, now, yes, they are changing that and it’s a big change.” Putin did not specify when the weapons would be transferred to Belarus, which has borders with three Nato members – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. He said Russia would complete the construction of a storage facility there by 1 July. “This is part of Putin’s game to try to intimidate Nato … because there is no military utility from doing this in Belarus as Russia has so many of these weapons and forces inside Russia,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement on an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Christine Kearney to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The US – the world’s other nuclear superpower – has reacted cautiously to Russia’s deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. A senior US administration official says there are no signs Moscow plans to use its nuclear weapons. Putin likened his plans to the US stationing its weapons in Europe and said that Russia would not be transferring control to Belarus. But this could be the first time since the mid-1990s that Russia were to base such weapons outside the country. Hawkish Russian politicians and commentators have long-speculated about nuclear strikes, saying Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if it is pushed beyond its limits. “Tactical” nuclear weapons refer to those used for specific gains on a battlefield rather than those with the capacity to wipe out cities. It is unclear how many such weapons Russia has, given it is an area still shrouded in cold war secrecy. Experts say the development is significant, since Russia had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. The senior US administration official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. “We have seen reports of Russia’s announcement and will continue to monitor this situation,” the US defence department’s press office said in a written statement. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance.” In other key developments shortly after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Ukraine’s deputy minister of defence Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. The head of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid.” The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said the months-long Russian assault on the city had stalled, mainly as a result of heavy troop losses. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. Russian oil company Gazprom reduced gas exports to the EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On 24 March, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5m cubic metres. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2m cubic metres. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/sep/07/a-biblical-catastrophe-death-toll-rises-to-four-as-storm-daniel-lashes-greece","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-07T16:09:45Z","webTitle":"‘A biblical catastrophe’: death toll rises to four as Storm Daniel lashes Greece  ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/07/a-biblical-catastrophe-death-toll-rises-to-four-as-storm-daniel-lashes-greece","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/sep/07/a-biblical-catastrophe-death-toll-rises-to-four-as-storm-daniel-lashes-greece","fields":{"bodyText":"Four days of cataclysmic rain have lashed the central Greek region of Thessaly, triggering landslides, road and bridge collapses and severing water supplies. In what was described as a “biblical catastrophe”, storms also hit other parts of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey. Rescue services announced on Thursday that they had found a shepherd washed away by the flood waters, and later discovered the bodies of two elderly women in a village near Karditsa in the Thessaly region, bringing the death toll in Greece for Storm Daniel to six. Across the three countries, the storms have killed at least 18 people. Greek authorities have sent push alerts to people in Thessaly, 185 miles (300km) north of Athens, forbidding travel until the water subsided. At least 64 people were stranded in several villages near Karditsa, the civil protection and climate crisis minister, Vassilis Kikilias, said, and the flooding also affected the port city of Volos after more than a year of rain fell in 24 hours at the start of the week. Emergency services were using divers, lifeboats and at least one Super Puma helicopter to reach stranded people. Andreas Diakodimitris, 49, owner of a small-plates restaurant in Volos, said he has never seen anything like the storm, which has followed wildfires that stopped just short of the city last month. Farther north in Evros, the EU’s largest ever wildfire began to abate only this week. The storage space where Diakodimitris’s restaurant keeps its produce, as well as goods for other retailers, is severely flooded, with water levels beginning to climb beyond the basement to the ground floor. “The cellar is completely destroyed,” Diakodimitris said, giving an estimate of more than €100,000 worth of damage. “We’re lucky no one drowned.” Power has been restored to most areas of Volos since Tuesday, though some parts remain cut off. Τhe main problem is water. “Running water has been cut off since Tuesday and supermarkets are running out of bottled water. It was meant to be reconnected today but now that the rain has started again today, it’s looking like next week,” Diakodimitris said. He said that although cyclone Ianos, a medicane that hit central Greece in 2020, wreaked severe damage, he had never seen torrential rainfall like this. “There were some [human-made] issues – riverbeds blocked and not cleared, some local works haven’t been done in years. But even then, the rain has been too excessive to handle. Houses and businesses are flooded and destroyed. And this comes after we’ve only been open for business for [a couple] of years after lockdown. I don’t know what else we’ll have to do to survive,” he said. The summer has been unbearable for the region: extreme temperatures, wildfires and now record flooding. “Just as we said that is over, we’ll put it behind us, now this has happened,” Diakodimitris said. “We had 10 days of breathing in smoke, then the explosion, the unbearable heat … It’s a given that this will keep happening, as long as people don’t respect the environment.” The mayor of Volos described the situation as a “biblical catastrophe”, saying the wells and pumping stations that supplied the city with most of its water had been destroyed, while stretches of important roads remained impassable. Bottled water supplies were being distributed by the local authority while running water would return from limited sources on a rationed basis, he said. Bianca Stangaciu, a nurse in Volos, who was on call as the emergency unfolded, was particularly concerned about the region’s elderly people. “We may have an influx of older patients who have been without running water, power and food for days,” Stangaciu, 35, said. Some residents of a local nursing home are being housed in the hospital after a wing collapsed because of the storm. The basement of Volos general hospital flooded on Tuesday, with firefighters deployed to pump out water. Stangaciu was able to obtain some water bottles for her family from a neighbour after supplies in supermarkets were drained on Wednesday, adding that bread and milk were also hard to come by. “All the neighbourhood has been out with buckets and basins. I’m washing the dishes with rainwater,” she said. “It’s a very difficult situation. “People in their 70s are saying they’ve never seen anything like this. It’s been such a huge volume, at such speed, that the ground cannot absorb it. We don’t yet know exactly how bad the situation is.” Stangaciu said she felt a great deal of anxiety about the climate. “The heatwaves are getting longer each year and now this. The whole situation is changing – the years to come will be challenging.” Yiannis Pagonaris, 51, the owner of a cafe in the city, said Volos was being hit by a “third wave” of rain. He was among those who collected bottled water from the local authority this week after soft drinks were bought up in local shops. “The situation is similar to wartime,” he said. He said no one could have prepared for the environmental catastrophe that has struck the area. “Greece isn’t prepared for circumstances like this – but it isn’t humanly possible to be. Even if it happened to countries like New Zealand or Canada, they would be in a similar situation.” “It will take a long time for the area to bounce back,” he said. “This summer, we’ve been through every possible thing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T08:06:53Z","webTitle":"‘Visceral and powerful’: the everlasting appeal of giant art panoramas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/panorama-paintings-grand-views-exhibition-california","fields":{"bodyText":"“So much of the panorama experience is visceral and powerful, being transported in front of these massive works of art,” enthused James Fishburne, co-curator of Forest Lawn’s new exhibition Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas. Fishburne spoke with me about this little-known but spectacular art form, taking me behind the scenes of the exhibition he co-curated in conjunction with the Velaslavasay Panorama. Grand Views offers audiences a rare chance to immerse themselves in the fascinating world of panoramas. The show centers around Forest Lawn’s Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection – which has displayed two enormous panoramas for decades – and it also offers other enormous works, like the Panorama of the Valley of the Smokes, made by artist Sara Velas in 2000. In addition, the show provides a rich assortment of broadsides, rare objects and ephemera from the 19th-century world of panoramas that help audiences truly get inside the creation and exhibition of these massive pieces. Curating the show, Fishburne worked alongside panorama artist Sara Velas and writer Ruby Carlson, both of whom co-curate the Velaslavasay Panorama – a museum dedicated to panoramas located in nearby Los Angeles. According to Velas, her love of panoramas goes back to her early childhood, and getting to show her work in this exhibit alongside ephemera from panorama history is something of a full-circle moment. “I knew I wanted to make things since I was a child, and being in St Louis I learned about the 19th-century panorama tradition. I went on this huge pilgrimage to Europe when I graduated college to try and visit as many of the panoramas as I could from this era. Remarkably, a lot of the artifacts and things we’re displaying in this exhibit are tied to things that I saw in that self-assigned pilgrimage.” Carlson, who has served as secretary-general of the International Panorama Council and who writes on numerous subjects, including panoramas, realized she wanted to dedicate herself to panoramas during a chance visit to the Velaslavasay Panorama, where she had a transformative encounter with the massive Effulgence of the North. “Me and my friends were the only people there at the time, and we spent a good hour in the panorama itself,” she told me. “It was just an incredible atmosphere, unlike anything I’d ever been to before and spending that time with a couple of my favorite people just made it very magical. I spent a lot of time at the Velaslavasay Panorama that day, and as we were leaving, I thought to myself, ‘I want to be here more.’” With Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas, Fishburne, Velas and Carlson hope to help others understand just how wonderful this largescale artform is, while communicating the long and rich history behind it. Due to the Covid-19 lockdowns, the curators had more time than expected to piece the exhibition together, letting them trace the rich web of connections between panoramas and much of Los Angeles history. “The fun part was the early stage, thinking about the connections we want to make,” said Fishburne. “There’s been so many incredible threads that we’ve been able to combine, since we got to let the whole thing marinate for an extra year-and-a-half during the pandemic. I think it really helped to enrich it.” One of those threads is the history of Los Angeles film-making, which is woven into the history of panoramas in California. Grand Views exhibits a Hollywood backdrop, as well as numerous cinematic artefacts, letting audiences see how these huge artworks have contributed to the development and evolution of film. The exhibition also offers a sketch for a panorama made by Disney imagineer Herbert Ryman, who is celebrated as being the first artist to ever visualize Walt Disney’s aspiration to create a theme park. “It’s really fascinating that between Disney, Hollywood, Forest Lawn, etc there’s this sort of cross-pollination among these worlds. And the final product is different for each of them, but they’re all sort of these very powerful, immersive, moving experiences. For Grand Views, we took slices of panorama history that are also interwoven with LA history.” A major piece shown in Grand Views is the monumental crucifixion panorama painted by Polish artist Jan Styka – at 195ft by 45ft, it is one of the largest paintings ever created. Simply titled Crucifixion, the work’s immense size and impressive detail give it a dramatic, cinematic air, heightened by the immense hall that Forest Lawn created to house it and the dramatic show it uses to present the work to viewers. According to Fishburne, “Crucifixion is one of the only four surviving crucifixion panoramas in the world.” He went on to detail how, in contrast to the other three, which are exhibited in a circular format, Forest Lawn’s hall draws from LA inspiration. “You step into this building, which uses ecclesiastical architecture, but then it also uses very Los Angeles–inspired architecture. The panorama’s theater space is essentially a movie palace. It’s a panorama presented in the way of a cinematic format.” Grand Views offers substantial context on the making of Crucifixion, as well as offering windows into the other three major crucifixion panoramas, all currently in Europe. “Through Sara and Ruby’s contacts with the International Panorama Council, we were able to get artefacts and ephemera from the three others,” said Fishburne. “You get a really rich sense of the history surrounding these works. It’s the behind the scenes look at how these incredible artworks were created and presented.” In a world where digital experiences are more and more becoming the norm, and where artistic innovations of the 19th century may seem as antiquated as the Pony Express in a world of text messaging, Grand Views offers viewers the chance to challenge their expectations and experience something both old and new. “What I really like about panoramas is that it frames the experience of going to see a painting more theatrically,” said Velas. “I think in particular it’s feeling very special right now because we’re spending so much time in this digital space.” Grand Views: The Immersive World of Panoramas is on show at Forest Lawn, California, until 10 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jun/16/victorian-labor-prepares-for-its-first-state-conference-in-three-years","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-16T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"Factions, power and Daniel Andrews: Victorian Labor prepares for its first state conference in more than three years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/16/victorian-labor-prepares-for-its-first-state-conference-in-three-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jun/16/victorian-labor-prepares-for-its-first-state-conference-in-three-years","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s November 2019. Tones and I’s Dance Monkey has been on the top of the charts for so long, you’d be forgiven for thinking its actually crawled into your ear and started gnawing on your brain. Richmond are the reigning AFL premiers (again), Covid-19 is yet to exist and the Victorian Labor party is gathering for its annual state conference. There are some factional tensions on show – members of the CFMEU and other left-wing unions walk out of the new Labor deputy leader Richard Marles’ speech – though it is largely a stage-managed affair that garnered few headlines. State conferences used to be the setting of some of the party’s most dramatic spats – over the direction of policy, and between the endlessly warring factions on the left and right. But the most major realignment of factional power in the Victorian Labor branch in recent years has largely occurred behind closed doors. As a result, as the branch meets this weekend for the first time since 2019, it will look much different than it did then. A lot of this can be credited to the events of June 2020, when the Age reported that upper house MP Adem Somyurek, the powerbroker for the moderates faction, misused public funds to fuel a vast branch-stacking operation and amass political influence within the party. A joint investigation by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog and the Victorian ombudsman later found there was branch staking, but said there was not enough proof Somyurek had committed criminal offences to recommend prosecution. He continues to deny any wrongdoing. The controversy saw the premier, Daniel Andrews, of the socialist left faction, ask the federal party take over the branch and clean it up. Former premier Steve Bracks and former federal minister Jenny Macklin were appointed as administrators to audit the membership, stamp out branch stacking and overhaul party processes. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For three years, all voting rights in the Victorian branch were suspended, with preselections for state and federal elections conducted by the national executive. A new “stability deal” was also signed between the socialist left and parts of Labor’s right faction – including the Transport Workers Union and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association – to carve up seats. These moves all but destroyed Somyurek’s moderates and put at risk MPs linked to other right-wing factions that weren’t included in the deal. Ten sitting Labor MPs were pressured to leave parliament as part of the factional purge. About 1,700 Victorian Labor memberships were also cancelled having been found to be “non-genuine” members. Months later, other senior figures on the right, who weren’t aligned with Somyurek’s faction announced their resignations. One of them, James Merlino, was replaced as deputy by Jacinta Allan – a factional ally of Andrews – despite the role usually going to someone from the opposite faction to the premier. This break in convention was seen as a show of strength by the premier, and Allan is his pick to eventually succeed him as Labor leader. (When that occurs is anyone’s bet – Andrews maintains he will serve a full term, but it’s widely expected he will quit before the 2026 election.) There’s no doubt the left will be keen to use its growing power to secure a majority on the powerful administrative committee at this weekend’s conference. A party president and members for policy committees will also be elected, as will the makeup of a new panel that will have a say in preselections. Powerbrokers on the right will also test their strength, which they will undoubtably need to build if it wants to challenge a possible Allan leadership. But for most rank and file members, the conference will be a opportunity to influence the government’s policy for the first time in years. Several motions to be debated this weekend by the 600 delegates attending have a progressive bent. Of the 109 contained in a draft released earlier this week, eight suggest solutions to the state’s housing affordability crisis and three urge the government to increase access and funding for abortions. There are the usual divisive motions to ban duck hunting and to recognise Palestine as a state. The motions may be changed or dropped before the weekend, as factions and unions negotiate over proposals. But senior Labor sources say they expect modified housing motions will be passed, given the government is already working on a policy in the space. One source said they did not expect there to be debates on the duck hunting or Palestine proposals, with the latter likely to be delayed entirely. Another motion, put forward by the manufacturing union, expresses “profound disappointment” in the Albanese government’s $368bn Aukus submarine deal is also not expected to go to a vote. Instead, it will be referred on to the national policy forum. Even if they were to pass, they are non-binding on the parliamentary party and would be unlikely to alter the premier’s course. As is increasingly clear, it is Andrews’ party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/20/joe-biden-aims-for-a-middle-east-hat-trick-hes-delusional-and-out-of-time","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-20T05:00:38Z","webTitle":"Biden aims for a Middle East hat-trick.

It’s as if the countries of the region, having ditched one overweening imperium, are now rejecting another. Slowly but surely, ruling regimes and authoritarian leaders are asserting their independence and freedom of action – some democratically, most not – while courting new allies. This reflects in turn a fundamental shift towards a multipolar world, where solo superpowers no longer dominate. In Saudi Arabia and the UAE, ruthless royals inculcate a homogenous national identity and project power abroad through financial clout, oil and sport. Trading on their strategic importance, they reject the status of western protectorate conferred by the US and, before that, by Britain. In Israel, hardline Jewish nationalists and religious extremists battle to define the future character of the state in defiance of Washington’s wishes, echoing the violent end days of the British mandate. In Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, heir to another vanquished empire, sets west against east and vice versa, alternately playing kiss-me-quick with the US, Nato, the EU, Russia and China. Since taking office in 2021, US president Joe Biden, mindful of recent, scarring American calamities and preoccupied by China and Ukraine, has mostly steered clear of continuing crises in the West Bank, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya and Sudan. His one big Middle East pledge – to salvage the Iran nuclear pact wrecked by Donald Trump – remains unfulfilled. In 1956 the invasion of Egypt fatally undermined Britain as dominant regional power. Is an irrelevant America approaching its own Suez-like turning point? Unsurprisingly, given his lifelong belief in American pre-eminence, but perhaps unwisely given the tenor of the times, Biden’s answer is no. Instead he’s belatedly launched an ambitious push to re-establish US regional leadership. Partly, it’s to counter the influence of Beijing and Moscow, partly to remind unbiddable local allies who underwrites their security and prosperity. Making a point, Biden sent 3,000 extra troops to the Gulf this month, ostensibly to deter Iran but also to show who’s boss. Political calculations are in play, too. Facing re-election next year, Biden hopes to score an improbable hat-trick. The prize is diplomacy’s equivalent of the triple crown: a US working “understanding” with Iran, a historic Saudi Arabia-Israel peace deal and a breakthrough on Palestinian statehood. Take Iran first. Talks in Qatar on releasing imprisoned Americans in exchange for unfreezing $6bn in Iranian assets made significant progress this month. The two sides are also reportedly discussing an end to Iranian military drone sales to Russia. It’s suggested the ultimate aim is an informal bilateral deal halting Tehran’s alleged weapons-related nuclear programmes in return for the full lifting of US sanctions – which is what Iran’s unpopular, economically embattled regime craves most. Talks continue. The second, linked part of this Middle East makeover involves Iran’s old enemy, the Saudis. The US has been rattled by Chinese mediation between Tehran and Riyadh and Saudi collaboration with Moscow. Biden wants to get the de facto Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman, back on side – and secure an Abraham accords-style normalisation of relations with Israel. To this end, he is reportedly dangling a security pact and US support for a Saudi civil nuclear power programme that could potentially match Iran’s, despite obvious proliferation concerns. Such thinking rings alarm bells in Jerusalem. No problem, says Joe. Saudi-Israeli normalisation could include US defence guarantees and advanced weaponry for both. And it would have the added benefit, for him, of sidelining an importunate China. Why should the US help and defend a Saudi regime that scorns its democratic and human rights values? After the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, Biden vowed to make the kingdom a global “pariah”. The answer is that normalisation would represent a big pre-election win for the president, especially when linked to the third leg of his plan: advancing Palestinian statehood. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s domestically besieged prime minister, badly needs a Saudi deal. The Saudis want one, too, but insist, on paper at least, on tangible progress towards a Palestinian state. Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners oppose any concessions, he’s barely on speaking terms with Biden – and in October, just to spite him, he plans to visit China. Even so, Biden seems to think he can win Israeli agreement for increased Palestinian autonomy, a halt to West Bank annexation plans and maybe a revived two-state peace process in return for delivering the Saudis, defanging Iran and providing security guarantees all round. Biden’s hat-trick hopes look slightly delusional. Myriad local negative factors aside, time is against him. Like the rest of the world, self-interested regional leaders wonder how long he will last – and will Trump replace him. How things have changed. Time was, the US, like Britain before it, laid down the law in the Middle East. But that was before 9/11 and al-Qaida, Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of China and the malignant Vladimir Putin, and the authoritarian assault on global democracy and the rule of law. Even a motley bunch of Niger coup plotters can defy Uncle Sam with impunity these days. And yet, in other respects, this shift is welcome. Why shouldn’t the world’s less powerful but nonetheless independent countries be free to let their interests dictate their allegiances, rather than be herded into permanent blocs, inflexible alliances and mutually antagonistic pacts? In these unsentimental times, why not play the field? The era of the all-dominant superpower and the “indispensable nation” is drawing to a close. Biden may do his darnedest to sustain the old order. But like Britain’s lost “imperial age”, the “American century” in which he’s so firmly rooted is passing swiftly into history. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The defence strategic review, released on Monday, called for the ADF to develop the ability to precisely strike targets at longer range and develop a stronger network of bases, ports and barracks across northern Australia. The Australian army will gain the ability to strike targets more than 500km away, up from the current 40km range. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia would become “more self reliant, more prepared and more secure in the years ahead”. When asked about a possible future conflict over Taiwan, Albanese said there was no shift in Australia’s position opposing any unilateral changes to the status quo. “We call for peaceful resolution through dialogue,” he said. The public version of the final report did not label China a direct military threat to Australia, but said China’s assertion of sovereignty over the contested South China Sea “threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests”. It labelled the competition between China and the United States “the defining feature of our region and our time”. The Albanese government has opened the door to potential changes to the number of Hunter class frigates and offshore patrol vessels to be bought by Australia, with a snap review of the navy’s surface fleet to report back later this year. The government also said it would consider options to increase stocks of guided weapons and explosive ordnance, including the rapid establishment of domestic manufacturing. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government estimated the cost of implementing the review would be about $19bn over the initial four-year budget period. But it said this initial amount was fully funded, through a combination of existing budget allocations and $7.8bn in new savings within the defence portfolio. In the longer term, the government is likely to have to find more funding to deliver its promise to increase defence spending. The defence strategic review, billed by the Albanese government as the most significant update of defence planning in nearly 40 years, was carried out by former defence chief Angus Houston and former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. The review called for a renewed focus on “how we manage and seek to avoid the highest level of strategic risk we now face as a nation: the prospect of major conflict in the region that directly threatens our national interest”. Announcing its response to the review, the government declared that the ADF must be equipped to “hold an adversary at risk further from our shores”. Five-point mission for the ADF The government has outlined a five-point mission for the ADF to suit the current times. In addition to defending Australia and the immediate region, the ADF will be required to “deter through denial any adversary’s attempt to project power against Australia through our northern approaches”. The more expansive tasks for the ADF are: to protect Australia’s economic connections to the world, contribute with partners to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific, and contribute with partners to maintain the global rules-based order. In a new “national defence statement”, the government said these aims were grounded in the view that the defence of Australia “lies in the collective security of the Indo-Pacific”. “As most of these objectives lie well beyond our borders, the ADF must have the capacity to engage in impactful projection across the full spectrum of proportionate response,” the deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said in the statement. The government says it will prioritise developing the ADF’s ability to precisely strike targets at longer range and to manufacture munitions in Australia. The government said the ADF must also boost its capacity to “rapidly translate disruptive new technologies” into its own capabilities. The government argues the decisions – together with the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus agreement – will ensure Australia can project power in an “impactful” way across the Indo-Pacific region. The minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, said: “At the end of this process, we’ll go from an Australian army where the maximum range of its weapons is 40km to being able to fire missiles initially over a range of 300km, and with the acquisition of the precision strike missile, ranges in excess of 500km. “This is about giving the Australian army the firepower and mobility it needs into the future to face whatever it needs to face.” China-US competition the ‘defining feature of our region’ Smith and Houston’s full report remains classified but the government prepared a public version of the report. This report said that in the late stages of the cold war, Australia faced no direct military threat. “Australia’s strategic circumstances and the risks we face are now radically different,” the report said. “No longer is our alliance partner, the United States, the unipolar leader of the Indo-Pacific. Intense China-United States competition is the defining feature of our region and our time. Major power competition in our region has the potential to threaten our interests, including the potential for conflict.” The report said the nature of conflict and threats had also changed. “China’s military buildup is now the largest and most ambitious of any country since the end of the second world war. This has occurred alongside significant economic development, benefiting many countries in the Indo-Pacific, including Australia. This buildup is occurring without transparency or reassurance to the Indo-Pacific region of China’s strategic intent.” The report said in addition to developments in the South China Sea, China was also engaged in strategic competition in Australia’s near neighbourhood. The report said there was currently “only a remote possibility of any power contemplating an invasion of our continent” but added “the threat of the use of military force or coercion against Australia does not require invasion”. “The rise of the ‘missile age’ in modern warfare, crystallised by the proliferation of long-range precision strike weapons, has radically reduced Australia’s geographic benefits, the comfort of distance and our qualitative regional capability edge.” Decision on submarine base location deferred The government will hold off making a decision on the location of a new east coast base for nuclear-powered submarines, after the Morrison government shortlisted Brisbane, Port Kembla and Newcastle. While the Morrison government had planned to make a decision during this term of parliament, the Albanese government said it would make a decision on a location for the facility “late in this decade”. It is understood the reason for the delay is to focus, in the first instance, on upgrading HMAS Stirling in Western Australia for the rotational visits of US and UK submarines from 2027 in the first stage of the Aukus plan. The review also underlined the importance of diplomacy. It called for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to be given the resources it needs to “lead a whole-of-government statecraft effort in the Indo-Pacific”. The report warns that climate change is increasing the demand on the ADF for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief talks at home and abroad. The government will accelerate and expand numerous projects, including a land-based anti-ship missile system and new landing craft for the army. But the government has slashed the army’s plan to acquire up to 450 infantry fighting vehicles, which had been expected to cost up to $27bn, as a replacement for Australia’s Vietnam war-era armoured personnel carriers. The review recommended reducing this number to just 129 vehicles, enough for one mechanised battalion, in a move likely to cause consternation within the army."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T23:41:06Z","webTitle":"Microsoft to power Bing with AI as race with Google heats up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/feb/07/chatgpt-microsoft-search-ai-artificial-intelligence","fields":{"bodyText":"Microsoft is revamping its search products with more artificial intelligence, using technology behind the wildly popular ChatGPT, as tech companies race to take advantage of increasingly powerful AI tools. The company detailed its plans at a special event on Tuesday, saying it would work with OpenAI, the startup behind the ChatGPT tool, to upgrade its Bing search engine and Edge web browser and enhance the information available. The announcement comes a day after Google revealed it is releasing its own artificial intelligence chatbot, called Bard, in response to the huge success of ChatGPT. Microsoft is staking its future on AI through billions of dollars of investment and seeking to capitalize on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology, and is already changing how people gather information. “This technology is going to reshape pretty much every software category,” said Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, in a briefing for reporters at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The move is meant to rival Google and potentially claim vast returns from tools that speed up all manner of content creation, automating tasks if not jobs themselves. Shares of Microsoft rose 3.2% in afternoon US trading to $265.10 a share. The power of so-called generative AI that can create virtually any text or image dawned on the public last year with the release of ChatGPT. Its human-like responses to any prompt have given people new ways to think about the possibilities of marketing, writing term papers or disseminating news, or even how to query information online. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s consumer chief marketing officer, said at the briefing that the Bing search engine would be powered by AI and run on a new, next-generation “large language model” that is more powerful than ChatGPT. A chatbot will help users refine queries more easily, give more relevant, up-to-date results and even make shopping easier. Mehdi said a public preview of the new Bing launched on Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks. Everyone can try a limited number of queries, he said. As an example of how it works, Mehdi asked the new Bing to compare the most influential Mexican painters and it provided typical search results, but also, on the right side of the page, compiled a fact box summarizing details about Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and José Clemente Orozco. In another example, he quizzed it on 1990s-era rap, showing its ability to distinguish between the song Jump by Kris Kross and Jump Around by House of Pain. And he used it to show how it could plan a vacation or help with shopping. The strengthening partnership with the ChatGPT maker OpenAI has been years in the making, starting with a $1bn investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the development of a powerful supercomputer specifically built to train the San Francisco startup’s AI models. Microsoft is now aiming to market OpenAI’s technology, including ChatGPT, to its cloud customers and add the same power to its suite of products. Google has taken note. On Monday it unveiled Bard, and the company is planning to release AI for its search engine that can synthesize material when no simple answer exists online. Microsoft’s decision to update its Edge browser will intensify competition with Google’s Chrome browser. The rivalry in search is now among the industry’s biggest, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. “Microsoft is looking to win this AI battle,” he said in a research note on Monday. The shift to making search engines more conversational – able to confidently answer questions rather than offering links to other websites – could change the advertising-fueled search business, but also poses risks if the AI systems don’t get their facts right. Their opaqueness also makes it hard to source back to the original human-made images and texts they have, in effect, memorized, though the new Bing includes annotations that link to sources. “Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,” is a message that appears at the bottom of the preview version of Bing’s new homepage. “Make sure to check the facts.” By making it a destination for ChatGPT-like conversations, Microsoft could invite more users to give Bing a try, though the new version so far is limited to desktops and does not yet have an interface for smartphones – where most people now access the internet. On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. Appearing at Microsoft’s event, OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said the “the new Bing experience looks fantastic” and is based in part on lessons from its GPT line of large language models. He said a key reason for his startup’s Microsoft partnership was to help get OpenAI technology “into the hands of millions of people”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/22/what-is-the-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty-and-what-are-the-risks-if-russia-vladimir-putin-suspends-it","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T02:03:25Z","webTitle":"What is the New Start nuclear treaty and what are the risks of Russia suspending it?

Those decisions were taken in order to “maintain a sufficient degree of predictability and stability in the nuclear missile sphere”, the ministry said in a statement. What is New Start? Signed by then US president Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2010, the New Start treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy. Together, the US and Russia own 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. In this context, “deploy” means ready for immediate use, rather than have in storage. Weapons kept in storage are “non-deployed”. According to an explainer of the treaty written by the EU parliament, “Warheads count as deployed if loaded onto a missile that is itself deployed”. Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are committed to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers. Each side can conduct up to 18 inspections of strategic nuclear weapons sites every year to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years after Joe Biden took office. Inspections under the agreement were put on hold in March 2020 because of the Covid pandemic. Talks between Moscow and Washington on resuming inspections were due to take place in November last year in Egypt, but Russia postponed them. Neither side has set a new date. What are the implications of a suspension? While the foreign ministry has said it would continue abiding by the treaty’s restrictions, a suspension of the treaty may mean that it will be harder for the US to monitor compliance. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts say it would be a serious blow if Putin went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments. John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the move is “entirely symbolic”. He believes that Putin made the announcement to pressure Biden into approaching Russia about ending the war, “so Russia can dictate the terms under which that would happen”. Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the weapons of mass destruction and other strategic weapons programme at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, told the Guardian the suspension was, “a big deal; suspension of the treaty is not equal to withdrawal but in reality, it could become really close over time”. He said that now, “Russia will probably stick to the New Start treaty limits,” but that it will “be harder for the US to verify compliance only using the national technical means. And I would expect the US also suspending its obligations. “One silver lining is that Russian decision is political and can be easily reversed if the overall political relations change,” he added. “Also, since the treaty exists, getting back to implementation would be straightforward. The problem, of course, is that there is no change of political relations in sight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-24T18:29:44Z","webTitle":"Nasa to test nuclear rockets that could fly astronauts to Mars in record time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/jan/24/nasa-mars-trip-nuclear-rocket","fields":{"bodyText":"Nasa has unveiled plans to test nuclear-powered rockets that would fly astronauts to Mars in ultra-fast time. The agency has partnered with the US government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to demonstrate a nuclear thermal rocket engine in space as soon as 2027, it announced on Tuesday. The project is intended to develop a pioneering propulsion system for space travel far different from the chemical systems prevalent since the modern era of rocketry dawned almost a century ago. “Using a nuclear thermal rocket allows for faster transit time, reducing risk for astronauts,” Nasa said in a press release. “Reducing transit time is a key component for human missions to Mars, as longer trips require more supplies and more robust systems.” An additional benefit would be increased science payload capacity, and higher power for instrumentation and communication, according to the agency. Nasa, which successfully tested its new-era Artemis spacecraft last year as a springboard back to the moon and on to Mars, has hopes of landing humans on the red planet some time in the 2030s as part of its Moon to Mars program. Using current technology, Nasa says, the 300m-mile journey to Mars would take about seven months. Engineers do not yet know how much time could be shaved off using nuclear technology, but Bill Nelson, the Nasa administrator, said it would allow spacecraft, and humans, to travel in deep space at record speed. “With the help of this new technology, astronauts could journey to and from deep space faster than ever - a major capability to prepare for crewed missions to Mars,” Nelson said. Nuclear electric propulsion systems use propellants much more efficiently than chemical rockets but provide a low amount of thrust, the agency says. A reactor generates electricity that positively charges gas propellants like xenon or krypton, pushing the ions out through a thruster, which drives the spacecraft forward. Using low thrust efficiently, nuclear electric propulsion systems accelerate spacecraft for extended periods and can propel a Mars mission for a fraction of the propellant of high-thrust systems. In a statement, Darpa’s director, Dr Stefanie Tompkins, said the agreement was an extension of existing collaboration between the agencies. “Darpa and Nasa have a long history of fruitful collaboration in advancing technologies for our respective goals, from the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the moon for the first time to robotic servicing and refueling of satellites,” she said. “The space domain is critical to modern commerce, scientific discovery and national security. The ability to accomplish leap-ahead advances in space technology… will be essential for more efficiently and quickly transporting material to the moon and, eventually, people to Mars.” Nasa’s Artemis 2 mission, which will send humans around the moon for the first time in more than half a century, is scheduled for 2024. The subsequent Artemis 3 mission, which could come the following year, will land astronauts, including the first woman, on the moon’s surface for the first time since 1972. • The image caption was amended on 25 January 2023. An earlier version said that Nasa hoped to land humans on the moon in the 2030s; this should have been Mars."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jul/11/why-comedy-is-the-most-powerful-tool-we-have-to-change-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world","sectionName":"Who Gives A Crap: Uncrap the world","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-11T02:25:27Z","webTitle":"Why comedy is the most powerful tool we have to change the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jul/11/why-comedy-is-the-most-powerful-tool-we-have-to-change-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jul/11/why-comedy-is-the-most-powerful-tool-we-have-to-change-the-world","fields":{"bodyText":"October 2021: a crowd gathers in New York’s Times Square, eyes wide, to witness 10 minutes of advertising brilliance. A screen flickers. A woman appears, snuggling a famous Australian marsupial. Cuddle A Koala! pleads the animated sign. And then: (Before we make them extinct). It’s a funny billboard, but it’s a serious message. Dan Ilic is a comedian, writer, producer, and the driver behind the billboards. Humour, he says, is a powerful force for change. “People aren’t as engaged as comedians, satirists and journalists think they are,” he says. “It’s an incredibly effective tool for getting information across that they wouldn’t otherwise consume in a ‘serious fashion’. Humour has an ability to cut through.” As consumers of information, we don’t always know what to do with it. Research tells us that being bombarded with climate change messaging, for example, can make us less likely to act. It’s overwhelming. It’s terrifying. Without humour, it’s hard to find a place to land on the scary things in the world, which come in an ever-increasing smorgasbord of choices. Comedian, writer and producer Dan Ilic. Finding a way to laugh about them, Ilic says, can be a cathartic experience that “takes the fear out of the everyday news cycle” – and that can be just what we need to take the next step. “People are often looking for permission to engage in civic life,” he says. “We often forget that democracy is a participation sport. By coming to one of our shows, listening to a podcast, or sharing videos, hopefully it’ll give you licence to be more engaged in the world around you, and to act in a way that shows you want to see a better world.” It’s not only comedians making podcasts in their wardrobes who are using humour in the battle to be heard. Clever brands also understand the value of taking themselves a little less seriously to give customers a reason to listen. Brands such as Who Gives A Crap. Who Gives A Crap is, first and foremost, a loo roll brand. But it’s also making a real difference. It donates 50% of its profits – more than $11m to date – to providing people with access to clean water and toilets. Plus, its products are made of renewable bamboo and recycled paper, which miraculously do not feel like sandpaper on your first bathroom stop of the morning. While this is all stuff worth saying, finding an audience to hear it is a whole different battle. However, Who Gives A Crap has comedy in its arsenal. No pun intended. The name itself is a good sign this is a brand with a sense of humour, but Who Gives A Crap has gone a step further to embrace comedy’s unholy power to make folks take notice. Its tone of voice has just the right amount of tongue in cheek to tickle funny bones, from the words on its packaging to the headline on its website that demands: “Don’t be a doo doo head!!!” Who Gives A Crap’s comedic chops now extend to a partnership with Ilic, in a new podcast, Changing the Bog Standard (so you know it’s going to be both good and meaningful). It’s sustainable. It’s cleaning both bums and the planet. And it’s funny. “The entertainment factor is critical for building a vehicle for communication,” Ilic says. “If you’re entertaining people, you’re engaging people. In order to be delighted by something, you need to listen to the contexts in which it’s presented.” Ilic’s billboards – which began as an ambition for a single sign at COP26 in Glasgow – might have done some good. The then prime minister, Scott Morrison, who’d decided not to participate in the climate talks, changed his mind and went along. Was that because of the billboards? Let’s put that in the “maybe” column. The campaign raised so much money that it became a global phenomenon. It made a racket. And it attracted the attention of everyone from celebs to average Australians trying not to drown in the rising hot oceans. “It’s about building something entertaining and engaging, then delivering a strong message along with it,” Ilic says. “I try to create a pathway for hope that something could be better, and here’s how. Here’s what a better life could look like. That’s the reason I get up in the morning.” Ilic has built a career around being a funny guy who actually makes a difference to the world. All his work has purpose, whether it’s his podcast and travelling stage show, A Rational Fear, or auctioning a fence that had covered a wall that MP Tim Smith had demolished with his car to raise money for the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Humour works in these campaigns, he says, because it builds trusts between creator and audience. Firstly, that we’re on the same side, and secondly, that something funny is about to happen – so pay attention. When an audience is hanging out for a punchline, it becomes a chance to whack them with what’s really important. “It’s not being afraid to look stupid to deliver something with a serious point. “Humour is such a defining feature of any brand in this space – the toilet tissue slash arse-wiping market is incredibly earnest. It’s shit, for Christ’s sake. When I look at those other brands I wonder, ‘why the long face?’. Thankfully, Who Gives A Crap not only uses humour in its brand but it’s also purpose driven.” Comedy has the ability to transcend the visible walls that people have up; it can reach people who aren’t normally engaged, or who don’t necessarily agree with a certain point of view. It can be something of a Trojan horse, Ilic says – even when it comes to loo roll. “Why would you wipe your butt with a sad brand that’s making the world a sadder place when you can buff your crack with a funny brand trying to make the world a better place?” And, in the process, we can all learn to give a crap.

The activist group Republic plans to hold a demonstration a short walk from where the king is due to be crowned. They have said they received letters from the Home Office warning them about new powers handed to police to deal with public demonstrations, while Scotland Yard has said its tolerance of protest will be low on the day. “Republic will not be deterred and we will be protesting on Trafalgar Square and along the route of the coronation procession on Saturday,” said the group’s chief executive, Graham Smith. “It is telling that Charles, who has had no problem speaking up on various issues, has chosen not to defend democratic rights when they are being threatened in his name. Perhaps he might make it clear that he believes in the right to protest.” The group said it received communication from the Home Office’s police powers unit that new powers had been brought forward to prevent “disruption at major sporting and cultural events”. Under those powers, blocking roads, airports and railways could bring prison sentences of 12 months, while people locking on to others, objects or buildings could go to prison for six months and face an unlimited fine. Police have also been empowered to stop and search people if they suspect they are setting out to cause disruption by protesting. “We have had two meetings with the Met police, and numerous phone conversations. They have repeatedly said they have no concerns about Republic’s plans. It is a mystery why the Home Office thought it was necessary to send us an anonymous letter that could be interpreted as intimidation,” Smith said. Referring to planned protests in general – not Republic’s demonstration specifically – the Met has said: “Our tolerance for any disruption, whether through protest or otherwise, will be low. We will deal robustly with anyone intent on undermining this celebration.” His group plans to meet on Saturday morning to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square. Organisers intend to hand out placards and are encouraging attenders to wear yellow. They are also setting up smaller teams who will stage protests along the procession route. Asked about its plans for the day, the climate crisis campaign group Just Stop Oil said: “While everyone is focused on a billionaire in a shiny hat, the government is signing off on plans to destroy the lives of millions of ordinary people, while enacting laws to ensure that no one can stop them. “They are closing all avenues for dissent and restricting our legitimate rights to protest. But we will not die quietly. We will continue to do whatever is nonviolently possible to end new oil and gas.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"The Power review – Toni Collette rules in this sparky sci-fi about superpowered women","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/31/the-power-review-toni-collette-naomi-alderman","fields":{"bodyText":"Naomi Alderman’s 2016 bestseller The Power is an absolute banger. If you haven’t read it, do. It’s a great piece of counterfactual sci-fi teeming with characters and questions, and as full of ideas as action as it asks: “What would happen if women ruled the world?” Now it has been adapted by Raelle Tucker, Sarah Quintrell and Alderman herself into a 10-part series for Prime Video. All over the world, teenage girls and young women start developing the power to create electricity within themselves. Sparks fly from their fingertips and suddenly a new world of possibilities opens up. Their power shifts the balance of society. Now women can defend themselves. Now they can fight on equal physical terms with men. We follow a global array of characters. In the US we meet Allie (Halle Bush), who kills her rapist foster father and then, guided by an internal voice, embarks on a spiritual quest during which she is given sanctuary with a group of rebel nuns, from where she gathers the ambition to remake religion. We also meet Margot (Toni Collette), the mayor of Seattle, who must deal with the personal and political ramifications of the phenomenon as her angst-ridden daughter Jos (Auli’i Cravalho) develops her power and the world begins to wake up to the potential revolution ahead of it. In the UK there is Roxy (Ria Zmitrowicz), the neglected daughter of a London gangster (Eddie Marsan), who has always been passed over in favour of his sons despite being twice as capable even before she started exploding trucks and electrocuting things with a single touch. She wants a seat at the table – and after her mother is murdered by thugs, revenge. Tatiana (Zrinka Cvitešić) is the wife of a brutal eastern European dictator who soon looks to harness not just her own power but that of the other women, as the spread of the ability starts to transform her nation. Finally there is Nigerian journalist Tunde (Toheeb Jimoh), who exploits a female colleague’s early awareness of the phenomenon, gets offered a job with CNN and goes travelling round the world as the new order’s most ardent chronicler. In the book, this large cast is masterfully assembled and controlled by Alderman. There is time and detail enough to let the reader invest in each one. It doesn’t work quite so well on screen, where it feels like we are hopping endlessly about but, given that we don’t get to grips with what is going on until the third episode, moving ponderously slowly towards each revelation at the same time. If there was a flaw in the book it was that – to use a literary term – things went to shit too quickly. Although we are undoubtedly too wise and/or jaded now to believe in the kinds of women-led utopias depicted in such feminist classics as Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland or Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time, The Power felt as though it skipped too quickly over the possibilities for difference, let alone betterment, and slid straight into a repeat of all the problems we have now, just sex-swapped. The series only covers about a third of the book and would therefore seem to offer time to explore alternatives, even if ultimately they end the same way (electrical power corrupting as inevitably as any other, and all that). So far, however, the adaptation seems to be following the original’s path, which feels like a missed opportunity. The final two episodes were not available for review but let us assume they pave the way for a second series and hope that more can take place there. I see no reason why hunger for at least a fictional world in which women are gaining rather than losing power would have abated by then. • The Power is on Prime Video now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/16/six-things-to-watch-for-at-labor-party-national-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-16T00:00:32Z","webTitle":"From Aukus to tax cuts: six things to watch for at Labor’s national conference","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/16/six-things-to-watch-for-at-labor-party-national-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/16/six-things-to-watch-for-at-labor-party-national-conference","fields":{"bodyText":"Once every election cycle, delegates from each of Labor’s factions gather to decide on the party’s policy platform. This shapes what Labor takes to the next federal election, acting as both a policy framework and a vision of what party members want the political arm to achieve when in power. Labor’s 49th national conference, which begins on Thursday, is the first in more than a decade to be held while the party is in government and the first where the left factions hold the power on the voting floor. But don’t expect that to translate to more progressive policy positions. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, wants the party to stay in government for at least another two electoral terms, and policy fights have been largely settled. By the time delegates meet at the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre, most deals will have been done and most agenda items waved through. “It will be a little bit of a bizarro world,” one Labor delegate described it. “Where people will mostly be arguing with past versions of themselves.” Still, there are a number of policy platform items that are worth watching. Stage-three tax cuts Despite Labor’s election promise to leave the stage-three tax cuts as is, they remain an uncomfortable fit within the Labor diaspora. Jim Chalmers, the treasurer and a member of the Labor right faction, will lead the tax discussions. He says the party’s position on the tax cuts has not changed. But there is a growing push, led by the union heavyweight Tim Kennedy, to review the income tax brackets in the third stage of the Morrison government’s tax reforms. Kennedy, the United Workers Union’s national secretary, has suggested tweaking the policy to better help people earning between $45,000 and $120,000 instead of those earning above $120,000. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Aukus in focus At this stage, the Aukus defence pact looks like being among the most contentious of issues for delegates. Under chapter seven of the draft platform is the sole reference to Aukus: “Our self-reliant defence policy will be enhanced by strong bilateral and multilateral defence relationships, including Aukus. Where appropriate, Labor will strengthen existing defence ties with our key allies and through the United Nations (UN), as well as building new and strengthening existing relationships within the lndo-Pacific region.” There is a push, led by hardline left delegates, to remove the words “including Aukus” from the platform. This looks like being one of the issues heading to a vote, with no agreement reached ahead of the conference. At least 40 Labor branches have called for either a review of the pact or opposed it outright, and motions opposing Aukus have been submitted for debate on the floor of the conference. But it is unclear which ones, if any, will be accepted. There is strong support for a resolution which makes clear there is no “open chequebook” for the pact, but other delegates see that as the bare minimum. Labor’s commitment to signing and ratifying the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will also be a contentious talking point. With the news of Australia acquiring nuclear submarines under the Aukus deal, there is a push within Labor to reaffirm the party’s 2018 pledge to sign and ratify the treaty, and propose a timeframe to do so. Some suggest there is “strong appetite” among delegates to show that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons remains a core party value, although it is not expected the treaty will be signed in this term of the Albanese government. The housing crisis Under pressure from the Greens, there is a push on for Labor to adopt a more progressive approach when it comes to the housing crisis gripping the nation. While housing does form a significant part of the draft policy platform, delegates on the left are worried it does not go far enough and are disappointed with the response from the party so far. Labor’s left faction is pushing for a tax on corporate super profits and using the proceeds to build homes to alleviate the housing crisis. They warn inaction on housing could result in Albanese leading a one-term government. Renewables and the environment There is movement in the environment and climate space, with about 350 Labor branches endorsing a push to significantly lift subsidies for renewables amid a global race. Many are also seeking an end to native forest logging and land clearing, although supporters attending the conference admit moving towards 100% plantation logging is a “spiky” idea for the party. The tension will no doubt be felt most among MPs representing electorates where native forest logging is a major industry. A push for an updated forestry policy beyond the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement is also expected, given much has changed in the last three decades. Hecs debts and helping young people With the dramatic rise in many people’s Hecs and Help debts this year, some union delegates will call for the abolition of the indexation applied to the tertiary loans. Those within the party’s left faction and in left-aligned unions are looking to focus on policy platform changes to tackle issues of intergenerational wealth. Along with the aforementioned super profits tax proposal to build more houses, the push will look at reviewing other policies to ease financial pressures for younger people. Asylum and offshore detention The left has never been overly comfortable with Labor’s offshore detention policy, but despite them having the numbers and voting power there is unlikely to be much change at this Labor conference.

We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before.” The recording aired on CNN on Tuesday, the day Woodward published The Trump Tapes, an audio book of 20 interviews carried out as Woodward wrote three bestsellers on the Trump presidency, Fear, Rage and Peril (the last co-written with Robert Costa). Woodward said he looked into Trump’s claim and was told by an official it was true. “Xi [Jinping] and [Vladimir] Putin would not know about” the weapons system, Woodward said. “But why is Trump bragging about it?” Trump’s cavalier attitude to nuclear issues has landed him in hot water elsewhere. Documents dealing with nuclear weapons policy were reportedly among classified material recovered from Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home, by the FBI in August. That is just one front on which Trump remains in legal jeopardy, others including his incitement of the January 6 insurrection, his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his business affairs and a defamation suit from a writer who says Trump raped her. Trump denies wrongdoing and maintains a lead in polls concerning the Republican presidential nomination. He is reportedly trying to appoint senior campaign aides, including, according to the Post, the Republican operative behind the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attacks on John Kerry 20 years ago. Woodward, 79, made his name half a century ago, during the Watergate scandal which forced Richard Nixon from office. Nixon resigned when threatened with impeachment. Trump was impeached twice but acquitted by Senate Republicans. On CNN, Woodward said: “I once said to Trump, because he was kind of asking, ‘What do you think the president’s job is?’ And I said, it is to ascertain the next stage of good for a majority of people in the country, not one party or a bunch of interest groups, and then develop a comprehensive plan and execute it. “And he said: ‘Oh, that’s good. That’s great.’ Never did he do this.” Trump “doesn’t understand democracy”, Woodward said, adding: “The United States was one of the rare countries formed on an idea. And that idea is democracy. “Trump doesn’t understand that the January 6 committee has proven that. He does not understand that he’s got to take care of the people. He’s got to give them advice, warning. And he didn’t do this.” CNN also played a clip of Woodward asking Trump, in summer 2020, if the Covid pandemic had made him say to himself, “Ah, this is the leadership test of a lifetime?” Trump answered emphatically: “No.” Woodward said: “He’s dismissing any responsibility he has. And that no is like a thunderclap: ‘I’m walking away from this.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T02:52:02Z","webTitle":"Russia blocks UN nuclear treaty agreement over Zaporizhzhia clause","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/27/russia-blocks-un-nuclear-treaty-agreement-over-zaporizhzhia-clause","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia has blocked an agreement at the United Nations that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) because Moscow objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine. The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russian refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine’s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its “protectors”, calling the negotiations a “one-sided game”. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. The NPT was a deal struck in 1968 in which nuclear weapons states pledged to disarm while states without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them. At the time there were five acknowledged nuclear powers, though Israel had secretly developed a weapon of its own by then. There are now nine states which possess nuclear warheads. Before the NPT came into force, some had predicted there would be dozens countries with their own arsenals. It is the second five-yearly review conference that has failed to issue a joint statement recommitting to the goals of the treaty. It has been 12 years since there was even partial agreement. But Sarah Bidgood, the director of the Eurasia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, said the NPT was not irreparably broken, and that every other country would have accepted the text. “The bigger takeaway for me is just how far-reaching the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine has become,” she said. “Even at some of the darkest moments of the cold war, cooperation in support of the NPT was often possible. But what we saw at the final plenary today does not bode well for the future of nuclear diplomacy, including on issues like arms control.” Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the disarmament elements in the proposed text had already been diluted by all five of the official nuclear powers recognised by the treaty – Russia, the US, France, the UK and China. “So, in all honesty, I don’t think it makes much difference,” she said. “This is the very dangerous game the nuclear weapon states are playing by consistently failing to achieve anything in this treaty. At some point, non nuclear weapon states are really going to start questioning whether or not this treaty is worth the effort, and if it’s relevant.” Fihn argued that the continued failure of NPT review conferences to find common ground meant it was all the more important for countries to join the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which seeks to ban them outright. It came into force in January 2021, and so far 66 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. “It’s going to be really relevant that we quickly move forward with the TPNW and get more states,” Fihn said. “It’s really an insurance that if [the NPT] continues to fail, that we don’t stand without anything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/dec/31/the-cloisters-by-katy-hays-review-the-power-of-tarot","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T07:30:11Z","webTitle":"The Cloisters by Katy Hays review – the power of tarot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/31/the-cloisters-by-katy-hays-review-the-power-of-tarot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/dec/31/the-cloisters-by-katy-hays-review-the-power-of-tarot","fields":{"bodyText":"Already a hit in the US, where it has been compared to Donna Tartt’s The Secret History, Katy Hays’s debut novel is about tarot, obsession, academic jealousy and Renaissance magic. This subject matter will intrigue many and discourage others. I was initially in the latter category, but it turns out that Hays is a writer who can skilfully navigate the narrow territory between suspense and melodrama. The main character is Ann Stilwell, a young woman from Washington state who has just graduated from her local college. Ann is fascinated by the “overlooked edges of the Renaissance … their gilt and pageantry … their performance of power”. She loves small objects that “might make me bigger by association”. Ann’s father has recently been killed in a hit-and-run incident, and she is desperate to get away from home. She has a summer internship lined up at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but when she arrives in the big city the MoMa job evaporates and she is recruited instead to work at the Met Cloisters in upper Manhattan, a “jewel box” of a museum consisting of medieval abbeys and priories purchased in France and rebuilt in New York. Ann is immediately seduced by these ancient buildings “polished to a new world sheen”. She loves the fact that her new colleagues are all “beautiful and sharp and inaccessible”, even if she herself feels like “a hick from an unknown school”. Her colleague Rachel is an orphaned heiress with Ivy League qualifications. Ann admires Rachel but feels closer to Leo, the mysterious young gardener who grows herbs (or perhaps drugs and poisonous plants) in the museum’s luscious gardens. Both Ann and Rachel report to the charismatic Patrick Roland, who is working with art dealers to find a particular pack of 15th-century tarot cards. When Patrick begins to suspect that Ann has found the cards he has long been seeking, and is keeping them concealed, his behaviour become threatening, and Ann realises that she is trapped in a world fuelled by jealousy, greed and ambition. The atmosphere of the museum turns to suffocation, possession, control; the summer heat of New York “sticky and thick and slow”. Patrick has always believed that this pack of cards might hold the secret to understanding the workings of tarot. Ann is sure they are a parlour trick, but as the tension at the museum increases, she struggles to separate reality from dream, and it becomes easy for her to believe that everything is decided on the dice or a deal of the cards. The book is all told in the first person from Ann’s point of view. Initially, we sympathise with all her insecurities. Yet as the novel progresses we understand that she is far from reliable. Why did she leave her home town? Are discussions of fate and destiny simply excuses for immoral choices? Rachel seems to be the controlling force. “She turned us all like we existed on her axis.” But who is the manipulator and who is manipulated? Ann has become “no longer an academic, a researcher, but a detective one clue away from greatness”. How far will she go to become “bigger”? All these narrative threads are laid out with care, but I worried that they would not be woven into a satisfying conclusion. This is exactly the kind of novel that often has an extreme ending, in which supernatural and melodramatic elements become a substitute for coherent plotting. Not so here. Late in the book Hays steers away from plot and focuses on character. Increasingly we see that what lies at the heart of this novel is not magic or fate, but two young women caught up in a vicious world of rampant ambition. Finally, there is a satisfying brutality to this book. We have some sympathy when Ann offers her excuses. She has only been learning “the lessons the city teaches me”. • The Cloisters by Katy Hays is published by Bantam (£14.99).

The Rev Keith Burchell (Letters, 9 October) is correct that cooling water was drawn from and returned to the Thames without any steam being generated by the cooling process, and the chimneys emitted smoke. But Claude Scott (Letters, 7 October) is also correct that steam issued from the chimneys. This came not from the cooling process, but from the curtain of water jets used to wash the smoke clean of anything regarded as injurious or offensive. A detailed description of all this can be found in a 1937 edition of Wonders of World Engineering (price 7d weekly). Mike Lee Rossendale, Lancashire • There may have been “plenty of cooling water to be had from the Thames” to service Battersea power station, as the Rev Keith Burchell says, but actually an innovative use was found for the waste heat that it generated. A large social housing estate, Churchill Gardens, was built in Pimlico, on the opposite side of the Thames from the power station, and homes there were heated by waste hot water piped under the river. The system also provided constant hot water for residents. One of my school friends lived in Churchill Gardens in the 1960s and, at a time when very few homes had central heating, it was always a treat to visit her family’s warm and cosy flat.

Five letters, two syllables: it’s a fairly straightforward word. Its Spanish equivalent, lo siento, has an extra couple of syllables but it’s not exactly difficult to say. Or so you’d think. An extraordinary number of powerful men seem allergic to apologies, living life by the mantra (sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill) that you should never apologize, never explain. Take Luis Rubiales, for example. The Spanish soccer chief sparked outrage after he planted an unsolicited kiss on forward Jenni Hermoso’s lips during the Women’s World Cup medal presentation. If he had just said sorry, if he had just expressed genuine remorse for his actions and tried to understand why forcing a kiss on someone is problematic, the story would have fizzled out and people would have moved on. Most people weren’t asking for his head, after all, just for a little introspection. But he couldn’t do that, could he? Instead he dug his heels in and started ticking off every cliched move in the Aggrieved Aggressor’s Handbook. Step one: claim she was asking for it. That’s always the first argument to come up in any allegation of assault or misconduct, isn’t it? She wanted it, she asked for it. Despite the fact that Hermoso has said she didn’t consent to being kissed by the Spanish football federation president, Rubiales has said she did. Step two: cast yourself as the victim. It’s a witch-hunt, they’re out to destroy me. Aggressors love to turn the tables by claiming they’re the ones that we should feel sorry for. In a bizarre speech shortly after the incident, Rubiales said his critics are “trying to kill me” and hit out at “false feminism”. Dude, nobody is trying to kill you. We just want you to understand the basic concept of consent! Step three: weaponize the women in your life. Men charged with misconduct routinely go through their Rolodexes and get the women in their lives to vouch for them. If they’ve got daughters, then they love pulling out the “as a father of daughters” line. During the speech where he railed against “false feminism”, Rubiales pointed at his three daughters and addressed them directly. It’s not clear how Rubiales’s daughters feel about being used as defensive props by their father, but some of the women in his life would clearly do anything to support him. A flair for drama must run in the family because Rubiales’s mother, Ángeles Béjar, has gone quite the extra mile for him: on Monday she locked herself in the Divina Pastora church and announced she was going on a hunger strike over the “unwarranted, inhumane and bloodthirsty hunt” of her son. “I don’t mind dying for justice,” she told the broadcaster Telecinco on Tuesday. By Wednesday, however, it seems she started to think better of the hunger strike and reportedly checked herself into a hospital. (The Santa Ana hospital would not confirm to Reuters whether she had actually been admitted.). A local priest who identified himself as Father Antonio told reporters she was feeling tired and stressed out. Not everyone in the Rubiales family is starving themselves in support. Juan Rubiales, his uncle and former chief of staff, told reporters on Wednesday that he is Team Hermoso. He also called his nephew, who has been embroiled in many other scandals in the past, “a proud, arrogant person and … a cowardly man”. He didn’t stop there. Rubiales, in his uncle’s estimation, “is a man obsessed with power, luxury, money and even women. I think he needs a social re-education program”. I’m not sure he’s going to get a social re-education program, but might Rubiales be suspended? The jury is out on that one. Spain’s administrative sports court (TAD) has opened a case against Rubiales for a “serious” (but not “very serious”) breach of conduct. If TAD had found that his conduct was “very serious” the government could have suspended Rubiales from his role. As it is, he can’t be suspended, but there will be an investigation and he might be banned from football for a while. Long story short, this saga is going to drag on and on. The only silver lining to all this is that the misogyny in Spanish football has become impossible to ignore. Is Texas going to start enforcing pregnancy tests at its borders? The way things are going it doesn’t seem implausible. Texas has some of the toughest abortion bans in the US but it’s still theoretically possible to leave the state and get an abortion elsewhere. Anti-abortion activists want to clamp down on that. The Washington Post reports that a wave of new proposals would make it illegal to use certain roads to drive someone out of state for an abortion. “This really is building a wall to stop abortion trafficking,” said Mark Lee Dickson, the anti-abortion activist leading this dystopian initiative.

Prof Paul Dibb, an emeritus professor at the Australian National University and former director of Australia’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, said the current Russian invasion of Ukraine carried potential global nuclear consequences, with the possibility of a defeated and humiliated Russia pushed closer to China in “a grand coalition … united not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. In a paper released on Wednesday morning by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dibb said “the risk of nuclear war is now higher than at any time since the Cold War”. “There’s also a real risk that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could escalate to a wider major war in Europe – and perhaps the use of nuclear weapons”. Australia should not feel its geographic distance from the epicentre of the conflict affords it any significant protection, Dibb argued. “We need to plan on the basis that Pine Gap continues to be a nuclear target, and not only for Russia. If China attacks Taiwan, Pine Gap is likely to be heavily involved,” he said. “We need to remember that Pine Gap is a fundamentally important element in US war fighting and deterrence of conflict.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pine Gap is a highly secret US-Australian military installation near Alice Springs. It serves as a major hub for US global intelligence interception, and for satellite surveillance operations for military and nuclear missile threats in the region. Russia is unlikely to be able to subjugate Ukraine in its current invasion, Dibb said, but Ukrainian military is unlikely to succeed in driving out Russian troops entirely. “Most likely there’ll be a negotiated conclusion, probably at the ceasefire talk.” Regardless, Dibb argued, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was unlikely to be deposed as a result, but he would be a leader grown increasingly isolated, and the threat of nuclear escalation was real. “There’s little doubt that Putin is the sort of person who won’t resile from the use of nuclear weapons, particularly if it looks as though he’s losing this war. But he must surely realise that there’s no such thing as the limited use of tactical nuclear weapons in isolation from their escalation to a full-scale strategic nuclear war. “Once we enter the slippery slope of even limited nuclear exchanges, the end result will be escalation to mutual annihilation – something about which both Putin and Xi Jinping may need reminding.” The comprehensive defeat of Russia in Ukraine would bring its own dangers, Dibb argued. “A severely weakened, isolated and smaller Russia might then become more – not less – dangerous for the world.” A Russia left humiliated would be driven closer to China, Dibb said, with the nuclear powers forming what he described as a “grand coalition”, unified “not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. Dibb told the Guardian: “The most serious threat to America would be a de facto alliance between China and Russia, united in the common cause of their hatred for the west.” Dibb said he did not agree with assessments that the US was “finished” as a global power, and could no longer be relied upon as a security partner. “We went through a tricky and rocky period with Trump and if we got him back it would make matters a lot worse for us. But I don’t agree with those who are arguing that America is finished.” He said Putin was motivated by an irredentist desire to restore former Soviet glory and power. “Having studied the Soviet Union and the threat of nuclear war for decades, the depressing thing is nothing much has changed,” Dibb said. “That has a lot to do with that history and with geography, but the threat remains, and remains very real.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/07/queensland-to-spend-5bn-on-1100km-copperstring-power-line-to-unlock-renewables-potential","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-06T23:41:43Z","webTitle":"Queensland to spend $5bn on 1,100km CopperString power line to unlock renewables potential","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/queensland-to-spend-5bn-on-1100km-copperstring-power-line-to-unlock-renewables-potential","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/07/queensland-to-spend-5bn-on-1100km-copperstring-power-line-to-unlock-renewables-potential","fields":{"bodyText":"The Queensland government has said it will take control of a $5bn proposal to build a 1,100km power line connecting Mount Isa to the national grid, which it says will “unlock” development of new-economy mineral deposits in the state’s north west. The project, known as CopperString 2.0, has long been touted as necessary to provide future energy certainty to Queensland’s north-west minerals province, where miners are considering the potential to extract large amounts of copper, cobalt, vanadium, lead, zinc and phosphate. The government said the project was a “Eureka moment” that would also provide a trigger for new minerals processing, battery manufacturing and new renewable energy generation projects in north Queensland. The proposal, which had been developed by a private company, will now be controlled by state-owned transmission company Powerlink. “CopperString is the most significant investment in economic infrastructure in north Queensland in generations,” the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said. “Unlocking affordable renewable energy and our critical minerals will benefit Townsville, Mount Isa and every town in between – unlocking thousands of jobs and billions in investment.” The government also said the cost of the CopperString project had doubled from early estimates of $2.5bn due to current market conditions. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The high-voltage transmission line will be built in three sections, connecting Townsville to Hughenden, Hughenden to Cloncurry, and Cloncurry to Mount Isa. Construction is expected to begin next year, with the project completed by 2029. Within government, there have been some concerns that the pace of renewable development, particularly solar, in north Queensland has slowed in recent years. The CopperString project would provide more options for renewable energy generated in the region. It is hoped renewables can power minerals processing in Townsville and other parts of north Queensland, partly to meet growing global demand for exports with “green” credentials. The energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said the project would allow for the development of 6,000MW of potential renewable energy in north Queensland. The Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the state’s conscious decision to maintain majority public ownership of energy assets would be beneficial, amid pressures on the energy system. “Our Queensland energy and jobs plan makes clear that we will own 100% of our transmission assets,” Dick said. “This announcement delivers on that commitment. And we can only deliver on this commitment because at least $500 million of the cost is being delivered through our new progressive coal royalty tiers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T10:00:34Z","webTitle":"Fears of renewed FBI abuse of power after informant infiltrated BLM protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/14/fbi-abuse-of-power-alleged-informant-denver-blm-protests","fields":{"bodyText":"The FBI’s use of an informant to infiltrate Black Lives Matter in Denver during the wave of protests over the 2020 police killing of George Floyd has prompted concern in Congress that the federal agency is once again abusing its powers to harass and intimidate minority groups. Ron Wyden, the Democratic senator from Oregon, is calling for the FBI to explain how it came to recruit a violent felon as an informant who then went on to gain prominence among Denver racial justice activists. The informant is alleged to have encouraged protesters to engage in increasingly violent demonstrations while trying to entrap them in criminal misdeeds. “If the allegations are true, the FBI’s use of an informant to spy on first amendment-protected activity and stoke violence at peaceful protests is an outrageous abuse of law-enforcement resources and authority,” Wyden told the Guardian. Wyden sits on the Senate intelligence committee which has oversight over federal intelligence-gathering agencies, including the FBI. He also fought for public disclosure of Donald Trump’s deployment in 2020 of more than 750 officers to his home town of Portland, Oregon, based on what he called “politicised and false intelligence reports”. The FBI’s infiltration of Black Lives Matter in Denver “appears to show another instance of the Trump administration trampling on the rights of Americans in order to divide our country and gain a political advantage”, Wyden said. “The FBI owes the public a full accounting of its actions, including how anyone responsible for attempting to entrap and discredit racial justice activists will be held accountable.” The Guardian contacted the FBI for a response but did not immediately hear back. The new revelations of alleged FBI abuses towards Black activists comes at a paradoxical moment, given the efforts of the incoming Republican House leadership. On Thursday Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump loyalist from Ohio, chaired the opening hearing of his subcommittee on the “weaponization of the federal government” which seeks to show that the main victim of federal overreach is not minority and progressive groups but Donald Trump and his far-right supporters. The actions of the FBI informant, Michael Windecker, or Mickey, as he was known, are revealed in a new 10-episode podcast by the investigative journalist Trevor Aaronson. Drawing on hours of undercover FBI recordings, along with internal FBI reports and interviews Aaronson conducted with genuine racial justice protest leaders, Alphabet Boys pieces together how Windecker inveigled himself into Black Lives Matter from May 2020. Windecker, who the FBI paid $20,000 to spy on the activists, stood out from the crowd. He was white, while most protesters in Denver were African American, and dressed in military fatigues. He drove an ostentatious silver hearse with a boot filled with AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles and other firearms. Despite his glaring profile, Windecker managed to convince activists that he was committed to the struggle for racial justice and could help them cope with volatility on the streets. He bragged about having served with the French Foreign Legion and the Kurdish Peshmerga. As 2020’s long hot summer of protests deepened, Windecker became more prominent in the Denver scene. He also became more proactive in his advice, encouraging activists to consider taking the protests to the next level. He told one Black Lives Matter leader: “I can teach you how to shoot a gun, to hand-to-hand combat, all the way up to like blowing up fucking buildings and guerrilla warfare tactics and sabotage.” Audio clippings from the undercover recordings obtained by Aaronson reveal what Windecker then went on to ask the activist: “How extreme do you want it to go? Do you want to learn to shoot a gun and throw someone around, or do you want to go all the way uptown? If that’s what you want to do, I can make it happen.” The podcast reports that Windecker went on to give an activist $1,500 to buy a gun for him, which led to the individual being arrested on weapons charges. Aaronson also alleges that the informant helped to organize a series of demonstrations in August 2020 that led to violent assaults on police stations. Windecker denied being an FBI informant, but when Aaronson told him about the recordings he fell silent. Congressman Jordan and his Republican team have taken to calling their “weaponization” subcommittee “the new Church committee”. The reference is to the post-Watergate 1970s investigation led by the Democratic senator Frank Church into the rogue behaviour and abuses of power by the FBI and other federal agencies. The attempt by Trump-allied Republicans to claim the mantle of the Church committee to justify weakening federal action against far-right attacks on American democracy has incensed those who participated in the 1970s investigation. Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado who is the only surviving member of the Church committee, told the Guardian that the new House “weaponization” panel was the antithesis of what he and his colleagues had done. “We did not have a partisan axe to grind, we bent over backwards to ensure the Church committee was not a partisan activity,” Hart said. “What is going on in the House today is a purely Republican operation. They are trying to go back to the bad old days by destroying oversight, particularly as it applies to rightwing militias and the insurrection on January 6.” It is perhaps worth remembering what those “bad old days” of the 1960s and 70s invoked by Hart looked like. Before the Church committee succeeded in imposing guardrails on the surveillance and other activities of the FBI, the bureau was largely untethered. J Edgar Hoover, the FBI’s infamous director, ran rampant, instructing agents to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit and otherwise neutralize” dissenting political groups in the US, especially African American ones. Under the vast Counter Intelligence Program, Cointelpro, which ran from 1956 to 1971, informants were used to infiltrate the civil rights movement and the Black Panthers, going so far as to blackmail Martin Luther King in an attempt to cajole him into killing himself. One of the Bureau’s favourite tricks was for its undercover FBI informants to spread rumours that the real leaders of leftwing and civil rights movements were themselves undercover FBI informants. The technique, which had a devastating impact on the Panthers, is known in the trade as “snitch-jacketing”. Alphabet Boys reveals that, in a chilling echo of Cointelpro, the FBI informant Windecker used exactly the same “snitch-jacketing” tactic to sow discord among the Black Lives Matter crowd in Denver during the 2020 summer of protests. At a time when his own cover was in danger of being blown, he planted seeds of doubt about key leaders suggesting they might be cooperating with police. Hart told the Guardian that he had no special knowledge of the events in Denver. But he said that the podcast’s disclosures were a timely warning against complacency. “The Denver story and other recent stories indicate that in some ways oversight may have become lax,” he said. “Maybe – and I don’t know this for sure, but maybe – the FBI is slipping back into the old patterns.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"‘Punk was my weapon’: the rebel power of culture in siege of Sarajevo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/punk-rock-vital-power-culture-siege-of-sarajevo-bosnia","fields":{"bodyText":"As a radio operator during the siege of Sarajevo, Boris Siber made use of music to blast the enemy airwaves and destroy their communication. “The Clash, Jimi Hendrix and the Sex Pistols, as loud as possible on the frequencies they were using … they changed frequency, then I found them again. That was my task.” Siber – a member of a hit Yugoslav comedy troupe before the war forced its breakup – also kept up civilian and military morale as a radio comic. “Music and mic were my weapons.” Enes Zlatar Bure was a firefighter by day, helping to extinguish fires caused by exploding ammunition, a position he volunteered for as an alternative to going to fight. By night in the blockaded city, he was the frontman with the punk rock band Sikter. “Our punk rock was a weapon to say: fuck you … you can’t do anything to us. Yeah you can, you can keep on shooting at us, killing us … but we will tell you fuck you, anyway.” The two are among an underground community of Sarajevans who recall in a new documentary film the almost 47 months they spent trapped in their city between 1992 and 1996 under constant enemy fire from Serbian nationalists, and how culture became their key to resistance and survival. Kiss the Future, directed by Nenad Cicin-Sain, which had its premiere at the Berlin film festival, has brought together musicians, artists and journalists who used music and art to rebel against their imprisonment and to assert their right to a multicultural identity amid Serb nationalist attempts to destroy them and their cultural heritage. Cicin-Sain, who was born in Slovenia to a Serbian mother and Croatian father, said he had been inspired by the rise of nationalism around the world to grapple with the story, and felt it was timely to bring it to a new audience. “Our intention was to humanise what it was like to go through something so horrific but in that darkness to find the most beautiful signs of humanity,” he told the Guardian. “Even in the darkest of times, people used music and art as a form of rebellion and survival and to help others. They wanted to find purpose, to feel human, to feel normal.” The protagonists recount their daily struggles avoiding sniper fire, living without water, electricity, gas and heat amid shortages of food, fuel and medicines. At night they took refuge and sought each other’s company in underground clubs and bars, risking their lives as they ran through sniper zones even just to reach the venues. Zlatar Bure recalls how Sikter, his band, played in a club called Obala that took on a legendary status. “We would go there and we would play. People would come and listen; they would have fun. It was kind of like teleporting to another place, like Amsterdam or Berlin, London or New York,” he said at the film festival. “None of us thought about what’s going on outside. It was like a capsule and that’s what kept us sane all the time.” He recalled how if the owners of Obale were able to get hold of petrol to run their generator, they would summon the musicians for a gig. With Sarajevo surrounded on all sides by tanks and snipers, deaths and injuries were a daily reality, he said. “Our bass player came to me one day and said: ‘Oh, our drummer, he lost his hand on the frontline.’ So what did he do? He duct-taped the drumstick to the stump so that he could play – he still plays like that now.” Gino Jevđević, a Balkan punk rock musician, composer and playwright who staged an adaptation of the musical Hair that was performed almost daily during the war, recalled: “The audience literally risked their lives, running from the different bridges to the theatre. Our sound guy died before one of those performances.” Vesna Andree Zaimović, a journalist at Radio Sarajevo who acted as a researcher for the film, said making it had ultimately been like a healing process but also a painful experience, especially when the Russian invasion of Ukraine occurred when filming was about to start, reigniting post-traumatic stress disorder in a number of the Bosnian film crew. But she said the Ukrainians’ fight for freedom had given even more purpose to the project. “Our story is a moment of history,” she said. “But it’s also an issue that is relevant and essential for the global political situation today. Everything that happened 30 years ago is deeply connected to the events that are happening close by today.” The longest siege in modern history is estimated to have cost the lives of almost 14,000 people, including more than 1,600 children. It was brought to an end by the Dayton peace agreement, halting nearly four years of war between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks. Zaimović’s message to those enduring the conflict in Ukraine and elsewhere, she said, was to remember “you are on the right side of civilisation”. She recalled how her then boyfriend, and now husband, Senad Zaimović, would try to shield her from sniper fire on their daily walk to work at a TV station. He was editor-in-chief of War Art, a daily programme covering all aspects of culture from fashion shows to comedy, and which broadcast from the city via satellite as a deliberate act of cultural resistance. “I was young and in love, so it was a clash between the most elevating feelings that a woman can have and the most brutal horror of the siege of destruction, and this is how most of us in Sarajevo felt,” she said. Cicin-Sain said he had feared the project might have to be called off for security reasons amid concerns of Russian nationalism triggering an aggressive response from Kremlin allies in Serbia due to the conflict in Ukraine. The US actor Matt Damon, one of the film’s producers, said he was honoured to be associated with the project. “It was an incredibly moving experience watching the uncut interviews,” he said. The film culminates in a 1997 concert held by U2 after the group was lobbied during the siege by Bill Carter, a US aid worker affiliated with a maverick humanitarian circus NGO. Much of the documentary is based on his book, Fools Rush In. Attended by about 45,000 people from around former Yugoslavia who flocked to the city, the concert was only possible due to the thousands of steelworkers, truck drivers and construction workers who did everything from reconstructing bridges to renovating the Olympic stadium so the band could reach the war-torn city and for it to host the concert. Across the country, people came out on to the streets to welcome the band and their entourage as they travelled to Sarajevo. The Irish group’s lead singer, Bono, who had visited the city in secret during the war at the end of 1995, expressed his admiration for the Sarajevans in an interview with Carter, saying they were the definition of the phrase “grace under pressure”. The title of the film comes from a speech Bono delivered to the ecstatic crowd at the concert, his voice hoarse from emotion, in which he told them: “Fuck the past, kiss the future.” Sikter, Zlatar Bure’s band, were chosen as the supporting act and opened the show with a punk rock version of the Bosnian national anthem. “If you ask me, that was the most emotional moment,” Zlatar Bure said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-479-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-17T00:27:40Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 479 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-479-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/17/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-479-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The centre of the fighting in Ukraine has switched to the road to Mariupol, where the Ukrainian offensive is slowly pushing back Russian forces, and British Challenger tanks are ready to join the battle, a minister in Kyiv has said. Hanna Maliar, a deputy defence minister, said the most active fighting was no longer around Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region, but in the south, and specifically in the direction of the two coastal cities of Berdiansk and Mariupol. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said movement in the counteroffensive was “the most important thing”. Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia had deployed its first tranche of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. He said nuclear weapons would only be used in the event of a threat to the existence of the Russian state. Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday, the Russian president also said there was a “serious danger” that the Nato military alliance could be pulled further into the Ukraine war. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia was ready for further talks on arms control. The US said there was no indication the Kremlin planned to use nuclear weapons to attack Ukraine. A delegation of African leaders met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv and urged Russia and Ukraine to de-escalate and negotiate, hours after sheltering from missile strikes on the capital. The diplomatic team called their visit a “historic mission” and voiced concerns of a continent suffering from the fallout of the war, including rising grain prices. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said both sides needed to stop fighting and “this war must be settled and there should be peace through negotiations”. Zelenskiy rejected any negotiations with Moscow, saying he had made clear to the African leaders that “permitting any talks with Russia now, when the occupier is on our land, means freezing the war, freezing pain and suffering”. The head of the UN atomic energy agency has said the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine is “serious” and that ensuring water for cooling was a priority of his visit, adding that the station could operate safely for “some time”. Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe’s largest nuclear plant following last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro river. He said: “With the water that is here the plant can be kept safe for some time. The plant is going to be working to replenish the water so that safety functions can continue normally.” The Ukrainian air force said it destroyed six Kinzhals, six Kalibr cruise missiles and two reconnaissance drones, with the chief of the Kyiv military administration stating they were all intercepted over the Kyiv region. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said there was no damage in the capital and reported an explosion from air defence in the central Podil district. The US has announced a further $205m (£163m) in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to help with shortages of food, drinking water and other needs. The aid, to be distributed via partner NGOs in the region, was also aimed at helping victims of the war maintain contact with family members who have been separated. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said in a statement: “We continue to call for an immediate end to Russia’s war of aggression and for Russia to facilitate unhindered access to providers of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and safe passage for those who seek to move to safer areas.” Nato has launched a new centre for protecting undersea pipelines and cables after the unsolved Nord Stream attack. “The threat is developing,” said Lt Gen Hans-Werner Wiermann, who heads a special unit focused on the challenge, after Nato defence ministers gave the green light for the centre, located in Northwood, north-west London. “There are heightened concerns that Russia may target undersea cables and other critical infrastructure in an effort to disrupt western life.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/31/art-can-move-us-powerfully-towards-civic-activism-on-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-31T17:14:12Z","webTitle":"Art can move us powerfully towards civic activism on climate | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/art-can-move-us-powerfully-towards-civic-activism-on-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/31/art-can-move-us-powerfully-towards-civic-activism-on-climate","fields":{"bodyText":"As the founder and director of the Climate Museum, which is the first museum in the US dedicated to climate change, I agree that art is critical to our ability to move towards climate justice (‘It’s positive, not apocalyptic’: can climate change art help save the planet?, 24 July). But contrary to this article’s suggestion, in our work at the museum, which mobilises arts programming to build individual and collective climate engagement, we’ve found that art doesn’t need to be positive or cheerful to inspire momentum and resolve. The climate artwork at the centre of our last exhibition, the epic postcard mural “Someday, all this” by David Opdyke, is apocalyptic. It depicts a future in which everyone is trying to get somewhere else amid catastrophic floods, fires, and ecosystem disruption. But it is also beautiful and filled with remarkable details, some of them with a sci-fi bent, and with gallows humour (a gigantic moth destroys a Musk Mars rocket, for example). Despite its overall dystopian tone, it captured and held the attention of thousands of visitors – leaving them feeling not dispirited, but ready to engage in climate action. The piece cites an example of the challenge of changing behaviour: visitors to an art installation who stopped, over time, tracking their own emissions, as suggested. But maybe the problem is with the specific call to action. We’re all embedded in a fossil fuel economy, and we need systemic changes to stop the combustion of coal, oil, and gas that endangers us. Tracking our individual emissions can make us feel both ashamed and powerless. In contrast, outward-facing actions as simple as talking more often about climate build a palpable sense of community and resolve, especially when framed as a collective project. Art can move us powerfully towards civic activism on climate, enhancing our sense of agency to an almost astounding degree. To have the best chance of doing so, it does not need to be upbeat, but it must be aesthetically strong, interesting, and paired with explicit suggestions for collective and civic (rather than individual and consumer) action.

The new rules require four operators at the Osborne naval shipyard, including those building the Hunter-class frigates and offshore patrol vessels, to guard against espionage and foreign interference. These operators have been ordered to prepare for risks such as “deliberate or accidental manipulation” of critical components and the transfer of “sensitive operational information outside Australia”. According to the new rules, information that must be protected includes layout diagrams, schematics, geospatial information and operational constraints. The operators must carry out background and suitability checks before people are allowed unescorted access to the shipyard. They must record the date, time and duration of access by every person, whether escorted or unescorted. The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, quietly rolled out the measures last week under the country’s critical infrastructure laws and confirmed the moves when approached by Guardian Australia. “Our critical infrastructure assets are targets for foreign interference, cybercriminals and other malicious actors who wish to do Australia harm,” O’Neil said in a written response to questions. “By declaring the Osborne naval shipyard a critical infrastructure asset we can implement security measures and build resilience in the facility and its workforce against these threats.” The government has said nuclear-powered submarines will be built at Osborne – the first project under the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK – but it remains unclear how soon domestic construction can begin. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The US has previously only shared its naval nuclear propulsion secrets with the UK – in the late 1950s – and US officials are determined to ensure Australia can protect those secrets against foreign spies. With just weeks to go until the three countries announce the Aukus plans in more detail, the new rules designate the naval shipbuilding and sustainment assets at Osborne as critical infrastructure assets. The instrument covers areas overseen by four operators – including the government-owned Australian Naval Infrastructure and ASC. It also applies to the entity trading as BAE Systems Maritime Australia, which will build the Hunter-class frigates, and Luerssen Australia, which has a contract for offshore patrol vessels. Each operator must set out plans to protect the security of its area of responsibility at the precinct and prepare for critical risks such as “the storage, transmission or processing of sensitive operational information outside Australia”. Other critical risks include a stoppage or major slowdown or “deliberate or accidental manipulation” of critical components of the site. Operators must also, as much as possible, “minimise or eliminate material risks” posed by “a malicious or negligent person” or by dissatisfied employees and contractors after they are fired or their contracts expire. The operators will have to provide annual reports to the Department of Defence. O’Neil said the country faced “evolving threats” and the Australian government would “continue to use our national security laws to protect the critical infrastructure assets that all Australians should be able to rely on every day”. In a human rights assessment attached to the new rules, O’Neil acknowledged collecting personal information about employees and contractors had an impact on their right to privacy. But she said this was “reasonable, necessary and proportionate in achieving the legitimate objective of protecting national security and the defence of Australia”. The head of Asio, Mike Burgess, warned this week that the online targeting of Australian defence industry insiders had increased since the Aukus announcement a year and a half ago. Declaring that his agency was taking a “more aggressive counterespionage posture”, Burgess conceded that Australia’s allies and partners were looking for assurances that their military secrets would be protected. Burgess said one of the reasons he was disclosing the successful operation to expel a “hive of spies” from Australia was because “as we progress Aukus, it’s critical that our allies know we can keep our secrets and keep their secrets”. He did not disclose the country responsible for the “hive” but said the spies were working undercover – some for years – with sophisticated tradecraft and wanted to steal sensitive information."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/31/former-ibac-commissioner-robert-redlich-legislation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-31T08:50:58Z","webTitle":"Former Ibac commissioner says watchdog has been ‘stifled’ by legislative powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/31/former-ibac-commissioner-robert-redlich-legislation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/31/former-ibac-commissioner-robert-redlich-legislation","fields":{"bodyText":"The former head of Victoria’s anti-corruption watchdog says it is being “stifled” by limited investigation powers as he called for an overhaul of the legislation governing the body. Robert Redlich, the former commissioner of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (Ibac), spoke publicly for the first time since leaving the role when he appeared before a parliamentary integrity hearing on Monday. He called for an overhaul of Ibac’s legislation, saying the threshold required for the agency to be able to launch an investigation – if it believes a criminal offence has been committed – has “stifled” its role. “That is far too onerous an obligation,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He pointed to the recent Operation Daintree report, which began as a probe into the government’s awarding of a $1.2m contract to the health worker’s union before Ibac took it over. Ibac’s report, published in April, found that a Victorian government adviser “improperly influenced” the awarding of the union contract. He said while its findings did not constitute criminal conduct, there was a “range of misconduct” identified. After the report was handed down the premier, Daniel Andrews, said it was an “educational report”. “The whole report is about findings of misconduct, and all of those findings go to a lack of integrity in the way in which the decisions that pertained to the union were made,” Redlich told the hearing. He also said there was “deficiency” in Ibac’s legislation, because only recommendations that can be published are those tabled in parliament. “Ibac doesn’t table more than two or three reports a year but we write countless outcome letters to councils, departments at the end of an investigation when we identify failings and set out recommendations,” he said. He said published recommendations should not include those related to individuals, but focus on institutional failings. “The community should be alive to recommendations that address institutional failings,” he said. In March, the Herald Sun published a letter Redlich sent in the final weeks of his term to parliament’s presiding officers in December, which included a claim that government MPs involved in the integrity committee had sought to discredit the agency. He alleged in the letter that government MPs instructed consultants to “dig up dirt” on Ibac as a form of retaliation for its numerous probes into the government He also used the letter to call for an overhaul of the state’s integrity and oversight committee to ensure it could not be dominated or chaired by government MPs. On Monday, Redlich said he wrote the letter because of evidence that “political issues” had interfered with how the committee conducted itself. “That’s to be regretted surely by all of us,” he told the hearing. “If this committee is stymied at the outset because political considerations override an objective determination to things that are wrong, then it’s a very sad day.” “If we can’t say the integrity committee of the Victorian parliament is acting with integrity, we have a very, very serious problem.” The government later cemented a deal with the Greens to relinquish its control of the committee and allow it to be chaired by a non-government MP. The integrity committee is holding hearings to probe the performance of Ibac, the Victorian Ombudsman and the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner. A report by Ibac last week found Victorian MPs and two councillors received large amounts of money and political donations to advance the interests of a millionaire property industry identity. Prosecutors will consider criminal charges, with the agency signalling it would send evidence to the Office of Public Prosecutions for consideration."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine says it has pushed Russian forces back near Kramatorsk; last Zaporizhzhia reactor disconnected after Russian shelling – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","fields":{"bodyText":"It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. He also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. In a joint press conference with Shmyhal, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe in full until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed western sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, adding that Russia’s full resumption of gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 was “undoubtedly” dependent on whether the west would lift its sanctions on Moscow. Concerns over Russian gas supplies continued to drive up energy prices, while the pound and euro slumped after Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. The contract for gas delivery next month in the UK soared by 35%, to 550p a therm. Winter gas prices were also up sharply. On Monday, the euro hit a 20-year low against the US dollar, falling as low as $0.9879 in early trading. Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to knock Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk city and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counteroffensive, with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dnieper River, which links the two sides of the region. The final working reactor block of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. Energoatom told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs despite its disconnection from the grid. Four of the six International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The meeting was the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. The EU is running low on weapon stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The country’s media regular, Rozkomnadzor, had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, its editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate, Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom after the verdict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. Johnson told the Ukrainian president that he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The Kremlin has said diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia could worsen under the next British prime minister. Speaking to reporters before Liz Truss was declared the winner of the UK’s Conservative party leadership election, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he didn’t think “we can hope for anything positive” as the contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia.

Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to destroy Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said: Our defenders successfully repelled enemy offensive attempts in the areas of the settlements of Bilohorivka, Hryhorivka, Pokrovske, Bakhmutske, Lozove, Spartak, Soledar, Zaitseve and Semihiria. In the Kramatorsk direction, they had tactical success and knocked the enemy out of the positions he had previously occupied. It went on to say that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. It added: As a result of Ukraine’s successful fire attack on Kharkiv Region’s Kupiansk, Russian occupiers lost over 100 troops killed and wounded, and two combat vehicles were destroyed. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has urged residents of temporarily occupied territories and Russian-occupied Crimea to prepare bomb shelters and stock up on drinking water. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: We ask residents of occupied territories, including the Crimean peninsula, to follow the officials’ recommendations during de-occupation measures. In particular, to prepare a bomb shelter, stock up on a sufficient amount of water and charge the powerbanks. Everything will be Ukraine. Russian officials have privately warned that the country may face a longer and deeper recession as the impact of western sanctions spreads in an internal report prepared for the government, Bloomberg reports. The confidential report, which was seen by the network, finds that sanctions by western allies could handicap sectors that Russia has relied on for years to power its economy. It paints a much bleaker picture of the true impact of Russia’s economic isolation as a result of its invasion of Ukraine than officials usually do in their public pronouncements. In two of the three scenarios in the report, Russia’s economy could return to prewar levels only at the end of the decade or later. All the scenarios see the pressure of sanctions intensifying, with more countries likely to join them. As many as 200,000 Russian IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, the report says, while also warning that the country faces a “blockade” that “has affected practically all forms of transport,” further cutting off its economy. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. Shmyhal told reporters after a meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council in Brussels: We need more modern weapons, such as air defence, missile defence and ship defence. Ukraine needed aircraft and more armoured vehicles as there were no signs Russia was willing to end its war, he added. Shmyhal also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. He said: We can replace to a large extent the Russian imports. 30bn cubic meters is what we have in our gas stores, and we can offer some of it to our European partners in order to replace the Russian Federation in the unstable market. In a joint press conference with the Ukrainian prime minister, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Borrell said: We will provide our support politically, financially, humanitarian and militarily as long as it takes and as much as needed. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was also on the sanctions list, as well as the US senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Rick Scott of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia. Penn and Stiller have been outspoken critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have both met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in high-profile shows of support. It’s 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe in full until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed western sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, adding that Russia’s full resumption of gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 was “undoubtedly” dependent on whether the west would lift its sanctions on Moscow. Concerns over Russian gas supplies continued to drive up energy prices, while the pound and euro slumped after Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. The contract for gas delivery next month in the UK soared by 35%, to 550p a therm. Winter gas prices were also up sharply. On Monday, the euro hit a 20-year low against the US dollar, falling as low as $0.9879 in early trading. The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available and that European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season but “we have more work to do”, a US official said. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk city and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counteroffensive, with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dnieper River, which links the two sides of the region. The final working reactor block of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. Energoatom told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs despite its disconnection from the grid. Four of the six International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The meeting was the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. The EU is running low on weapon stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The country’s media regular, Rozkomnadzor, had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, its editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate, Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom after the verdict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. Johnson told the Ukrainian president that he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The Kremlin has said diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia could worsen under the next British prime minister. Speaking to reporters before Liz Truss was declared the winner of the UK’s Conservative party leadership election, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he didn’t think “we can hope for anything positive” as the contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia had yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives in its war in Ukraine. Russia “continues to lose significant equipment and personnel”, Wallace told MPs in the Commons. He said: It is estimated to date that over 25,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives, and in all if you include killed, casualties, captured, or the now reported tens of thousands of deserters, over 80,000 dead or injured and the other categories. This will have long-lasting impact on Russia’s army and its future combat effectiveness. Russia has yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives. And we are now on day 194 of what was envisaged in total to be a month-long campaign. Wallace likened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to a drug dealer who gets European countries “hooked” on gas. He urged unity across the continent over the winter, adding: If we don’t stand together, we don’t deal with it now, these threats won’t go away on their own and to the people in Prague or Cologne, if you give in to the dealer – the drug dealer, or the guy that gets you hooked on heroin – he will be back for more in a good few years. The final working reactor block of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. In a Telegram statement, Energoatom said: Today, as a result of a fire caused by shelling, the [last working] transmission line was disconnected. As a result, [reactor] unit No 6, which currently supplies the [plant’s] own needs, was unloaded and disconnected from the grid. The company told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs, despite its disconnection from the grid. The plant’s backup diesel generators, which provide power for cooling in the event of a shutdown, have not been turned on, they added. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, warned that the world was “once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster” following the initial news. Galushchenko added that the only way to ensure nuclear safety was the de-occupation of the plant and the creation of a demilitarised zone around the facility. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, has been covering the sentencing of the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison for treason. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom following the verdict. Speaking outside the courtroom, Safronov’s lawyer, Dmitry Katchev, said he was almost lost for words at the ruling. Katchev told reporters: Safronov was given 22 years for his journalistic activity. I want each of you, who are looking at me now, to think whether it is worth staying in this profession. If somebody was given 22 years for doing his job. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was found guilty in the Moscow court of treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. Many will see today’s ruling as an enormous blow to media freedom in Russia, as it comes on the same day that a Moscow court stripped Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside the country. Boris Johnson thanked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for his “leadership and friendship” during a phone call this afternoon, Downing Street has said. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: The prime minister made clear that he believed President Zelenskiy and his people can and will win the war in Ukraine. President Zelenskiy thanked the prime minister for believing in Ukraine and his people and updated on the recent progress of his armed forces in the south of the country. Johnson said he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The spokesperson added: The prime minister told President Zelenskiy it had been a privilege to work with him and support him and the leaders agreed to stay in close touch as friends. The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. “Russia is using energy as a weapon and it is choosing to shut down the pipeline,” a US official said. “The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available. As a result of these efforts, European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season. We have more work to do.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked outgoing British prime minister Boris Johnson for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. The Ukrainian president had a “summing up conversation” with Johnson, he wrote on Twitter: Russian-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia due to attacks by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine last week said it had launched offensives in several directions in the southern region but has since released few details and continues to insist on a “regime of silence” for strategic reasons. The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” due to the security situation. Stremousov told TASS that attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dneiper River, which links the two sides of the region. In the conference, Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, congratulated Liz Truss for her “clear victory” and wished her the best as Britain’s new leader – but said he was not expecting the UK to return to the EU any time soon. A press conference with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell is under way in Brussels. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason, in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. His lawyers told the RIA Novosti news agency they will appeal the verdict. My colleague Andrew Roth is in court covering Safronov’s ruling: French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a “substantive” phone call to discuss the situation on the frontline and to coordinate further defence support from France, the Ukrainian leader said. The talks between the two leaders took more than an hour and a half, according to Zelenskiy. Following the call, Macron said the only way to restore security at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was via withdrawal of Russian troops, the Élysée palace said in a statement. The Kremlin has warned that Russia will not resume gas supplies to Europe until western sanctions are lifted, blaming the “collective west” for its decision to shut down flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was cited earlier today by the Interfax news agency as saying: The problems pumping gas came about because of the sanctions western countries introduced against our country and several companies. There are no other reasons that could have caused this pumping problem. Peskov’s comments mark Moscow’s clearest demand to date that the EU roll back its sanctions in exchange for Russia resuming gas deliveries to the continent. But the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, points out that Peskov did leave some wiggle room. China’s foreign ministry has voiced its opposition to the agreement by G7 countries to impose a price cap on Russian oil, and urged countries to ease the situation “through dialogue”. Oil is one of the global commodities and it is “crucial to ensure the security of global energy supply”, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, told reporters. Mao added: We hope that relevant countries will make constructive efforts to ease the situation through dialogue and consultation, not do the opposite. The EU is running low on weapons stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Borrell said: The military stocks of most member states has been, I wouldn’t say exhausted, but depleted in a high proportion, because we have been providing a lot of capacity to the Ukrainians. He added: It has to be refilled. The best way of refilling is doing that together. It will be cheaper. If EU countries continue to expand their military capabilities in the same way, “the result will be a big waste of money, because this is not a way of cancelling our duplications – there are a lot of them – or filling our gaps”, he said. Borrell admitted that the EU should have begun to train Ukraine’s armed forces a year ago, months before Russia launched its invasion, after several member countries requested such an operation. Had the EU responded at the time, “we would be in a better situation”, he said, adding: Unhappily we didn’t, and today we regret. We regret that last August we were not following this request, fulfilling this request. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. In addition to the latest aid package, Ukraine will also be able to apply to the EU digital economy fund to develop hi-tech training and industry. The meeting today in Brussels will be the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. It was chaired by the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and enlargement commissioner Olivér Várhelyi. During the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war, the invading force was approaching the Irpin River and the gates of the Ukrainian capital. But the river waters suddenly rose, forcing the Russians to turn back and leaving a trail of abandoned tanks and military hardware. Kyiv breathed again and a wetland ecosystem was reflooded for the first time in more than 70 years. Miraculous as it might have seemed, it wasn’t the hand of God that helped save Ukraine. “That’s warWilding,” says Jasper Humphreys, the director of programmes for the Marjan Study Group in the department of war studies at King’s College London, which researches conflict and the environment. “I woke up in the middle of the night, a few days after reading the ‘hero river’ story in the Guardian about how the Ukrainian army reflooded the dying Irpin River and its former wetlands to save the Ukrainian capital,” says the academic, of how he came up with the word. “And I just sat up in bed and whispered to myself, ‘It’s warWilding’.” Read the full story: WarWilding: a new word to describe the startling effects of using nature as a weapon A Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Kherson region said plans for a referendum on joining Russia have “taken a pause due to security considerations”, Russian state media reported. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the occupied Kherson region, was cited by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency as saying: We have got prepared for voting. We wanted to organise the referendum in the near future, but because of the current developments, I think we will take a pause. It is quite explainable from the practical point of view. We are not running before the hounds and are focused on our key task - to feed people, to ensure their security. The Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in Kherson had previously said it had begun preparations for a referendum on joining Russia. The Guardian has spoken with people in the Russian-controlled region who said they were opposed to voting in a referendum or joining Russia. Stremousov was also quoted as saying that the vital Antonivskyi bridge, which crosses the Dnipro river near Kherson city, can no longer be crossed by car after weeks of Ukrainian shelling. Almost all of the Kherson region has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Last week, Ukraine announced it had begun its counteroffensive in an attempt to retake the southern region from occupying forces. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The Basmanny district court in Moscow said it had invalidated the newspaper’s licence at the request of the country’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor. Rozkomnadzor had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Novaya Gazeta’s lawyers insist that the changes did not require presenting the charter to the authorities. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. Novaya Gazeta suspended operations in late March after being forced to remove material from its website on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court verdict in effect bans the outlet from operating. Rozkomnadzor is also seeking to shut down Novaya Gazeta’s website and a print magazine that it launched in July. Two court hearings are scheduled for later this month. Today’s ruling comes less than a week after the death of the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped in the founding of Novaya Gazeta in the early 1990s. Muratov led the procession at Gorbachev’s Moscow funeral on Saturday. Six of Novaya Gazeta’s reporters have been killed in assassinations that the newspaper and human rights groups say were connected with their work, including top investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far. The Kremlin has said they think there is little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also warned that Moscow would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely. The move has stoked renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his government had planned a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under pressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. The Kremlin has warned also warned that it would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. A group of seven finance ministers agreed the cap on Friday in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but Moscow has vowed to halt sales to countries imposing it. The Kremlin said has that they think there was little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister, as they think the leadership contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. “I don’t think we can hope for anything positive,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with the UK. Peskov said: I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse. Asked if Vladimir Putin would send a congratulatory telegram to the next PM, he said: Let’s wait and see who becomes prime minister. Britain’s next prime minister is set to be announced later today, following a weeks-long party leadership contest between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, while the remaining two still stay on a permanent basis. You can read the Guardian’s previous reporting on the issue here: European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely, stoking renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. Reuters reports: The benchmark gas price surged as high as 272 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) when the market opened after Russia said on Friday that a leak in Nord Stream 1 pipeline equipment meant it would stay shut beyond last week’s three-day maintenance halt. The Dutch TTF October gas contract had eased to 256 euros, up 23% on the day by 0723 GMT but almost 400% higher than a year ago. This year’s price surge has squeezed struggling already consumers and forced some industries to halt production. Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia says the West has launched an economic war and sanctions have hampered pipeline operations. The Nord Stream pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe but it was already running at just 20% of capacity before flows were halted last week for maintenance. Russian gas being supplied via Ukraine, another major route, has also been reduced, leaving the EU racing to find alternative supplies to refill gas storage facilities for winter. Several states have trigger emergency plans that could lead to energy rationing and raising prospects for a recession. “Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn’t come from Russia,” said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. A suicide bomber detonated explosives near the entrance of the Russian embassy in Kabul, police said on Monday, adding the attacker was shot dead by armed guards as he approached the gate. The head of the police district, Mawlawi Sabir, told Reuters: “The suicide attacker before reaching the target, was recognised and shot by Russian embassy (Taliban) guards … there is no information about casualties yet”. Russia is one of the few countries to have maintained an embassy in Kabul after the Taliban took over the country more than a year ago. Myanmar’s junta leader has been on a visit to Russia, his second trip there in less than two months, as Myanmar’s ruling military tries to shore up one of its few diplomatic alliances as it comes under growing international pressure. Reuters reports: Min Aung Hlaing, the country’s senior general, has been barred from representing Myanmar at most international gatherings since leading a coup early last year against an elected government led by Noble laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. He first visited Moscow as leader in June last year, when both sides committed to strengthening military cooperation. He also visited in July on what Russia said was a private visit. Russia, a main source of military hardware for Myanmar, was one of the first countries to voice support for the junta after the coup, at a time when it was receiving international condemnation over its use of lethal force against opponents. Myanmar state media said he would attend an economic summit, visit landmarks, universities and factories and his ministers and senior military officials would meet counterparts and “cement friendly cooperation”. Russia has been providing Myanmar with COVID-19 vaccines and Myanmar is planning to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns, as Russia looks for new sources of business amid Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Myanmar’s junta has been hit by a raft of sanctions targeting the generals and the extensive business network the military operates. The United Nations and activists have accused the Myanmar military of atrocities and crimes against humanity and have urged the international community to cut off arms sales, with Russia singled out for supplying drones, jets and air defence systems since the coup. Myanmar’s military says it is fighting “terrorists” and is seeking to restore peace and re-establish democratic rule after a 2020 election it said was marred by fraud. On Sunday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked his forces for taking two settlements in the south and a third, along with additional territory, in the east, citing “good reports” from his military commanders and intelligence head. Reuters reports: Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, earlier posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in the southern area that is the main focus of the counter-offensive. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook over a photograph of three soldiers on rooftops, one of them fixing a Ukrainian flag to a post. Ukraine began the counter-offensive last week targeting the south, particularly the Kherson region, which Russia seized early in the conflict. After Ukrainian forces’ intense shelling of clusters of Russian troops in the region, the Russians have banned movement of residents, forbidding them to cross the Dnipro River, the Ukrainian general staff said on Monday. Russia has launched 25 missile strikes, and more than 22 air strikes, on military and civilian targets in Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the statement added, keeping up its focus on establishing full control over the Donetsk region. The prospect of higher natural gas prices raises the spectre of recession in Europe this winter and that is bad news for the euro which has fallen to a 20-year low against the US dollar this morning. The single currency dropped 0.7% in early trade on Monday taking it below 99c to US0.9880 – its lowest mark for more than 20 years. The pound is also being crushed by the grim economic outlook across Europe and has lost 0.6% to stand at $1.145. Liz Truss is likely to take power in the UK on Tuesday and has pledged to act in her first week of office to tackle the crisis caused by rising energy bills. Full report here: The UK Ministry of Defence says in its morning intelligence update that despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said in a tweet on Monday morning, “… but its forces have still only been advancing around 1km per week towards Bakhmut.” “The political goal of the Donbas operation almost certainly remains to secure the whole of Donetsk Oblast, which would enable the Kremlin to announce the ‘liberation’ of the Donbas. Russian forces have highly likely repeatedly missed deadlines to achieve this aim. “The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that Russian forces are now under orders to complete this mission by 15 September 2022. The force is highly unlikely to achieve this, which will further complicate Russia’s plans to run referendums on the occupied areas joining the Russian Federation.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Sunday that progress was being made to “liberate all our lands, all our people” after the beginning of the counteroffensive against the Russians in the south. “The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this,” Zelenskiy said in a speech posted on Facebook. “These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them.” He also thanked the “warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade” who liberated a settlement in the Donetsk region. The “54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights”, while the “42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated”. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. The Kremlin has blamed European politicians for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, one of its main gas supply routes, saying their economic sanctions on Russia had hindered Gazprom’s maintenance of the pipeline, Reuters reports. “If the Europeans absolutely absurdly make a decision to refuse to service their equipment, or rather, equipment that belongs to Gazprom, but which they are contractually required to service, this is not Gazprom’s fault,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russia’s state television, according to the Interfax news agency. “It is the fault of those politicians who made decisions on sanctions.” Gas prices are tipped to rise sharply in Europe on Monday morning after Russian company Gazprom said it was closing the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline until further notice, citing maintenance issues. Prices have soared since the invasion of Ukraine led to western sanctions on Russia, with the Kremlin responding by cutting gas exports to Europe. Prices had begun to fall last week amid some optimism that Europe could make it through the forthcoming winter months without households and industry having their supplies cut off. But the Nord Stream closure has refeocused markets on the problem and seem certain to send prices up again. Here’s the state of play in the UK natural gas market on Monday morning – prices in pence per therm: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Russia’s war against Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s a little bit after 8am in Ukraine and the main developments you need to know about are here: Gas prices in Europe are expected to surge to record highs this week after Russia shut down a key pipeline to Europe. Many commentators warned that European prices will further rise when markets open on Monday after Moscow scrapped a Saturday deadline for flows to resume through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, saying it had discovered a fault during maintenance. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government had been planning for a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under poressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday The pipeline shutdown pushed the pound lower by 0.37% on Monday morning to $1.147 amid concerns about the economy’s ability to withstand higher gas prices. The euro is also down 0.3% and looks likely to test the recent 20-year low of $0.99005 as traders priced in more risk of a European recession. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy claimed during his Sunday evening address. “The Ukrainian flags are returning to the places where they should be by right,” he added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. Russia said the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine controlled by its troops was calm on Sunday, after UN inspectors said on Saturday it had again lost external power. The last remaining main external power line was cut off although a reserve line continued supplying electricity to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement. Only one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said. Thousands gathered in Prague on Sunday to protest at soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. About 70,000 far-right and extreme-left elements coalesced at a “Czech Republic First” rally to call for a new agreement with Moscow over gas supplies and a halt to the sending of arms to Ukraine on Sunday. A Russian journalist is facing a 24-year jail term for treason. Ivan Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, is facing a “record” sentence on treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. A Russian judge is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. The Russian state should be tried for historical crimes committed by the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa said before the premiere of his new documentary, The Kiev Trial, at Venice. Speaking at a press conference, Loznitza said there needed to be contrition for the wrongs of the past. “History repeats itself when we don’t learn from history, when we didn’t study it and don’t want to know what happened with us,” he said. Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia. The Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources after its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September. China’s top legislator, Li Zhanshu, will attend the seventh Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok this week, becoming the most senior Chinese official to visit Russia since the Ukraine war began. Li, chairman of the national people’s Congress Standing Committee, will pay official visits to Russia, Mongolia, Nepal and South Korea from Wednesday to 17 September, according to Xinhua news agency. He will attend the four-day forum, set to begin on Monday, during his stay in Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/27/nick-hitchon-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-27T11:00:40Z","webTitle":"Nick Hitchon obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/27/nick-hitchon-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/27/nick-hitchon-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My brother, Nick Hitchon, was an expert in nuclear fusion who eventually accepted that he would always be best known for appearing in a groundbreaking TV documentary rather than as a scientist. Nick, who has died aged 65 following a long illness, was a determined and committed individual whose work took him thousands of miles from his upbringing in a Yorkshire Dales farming family. His dream was to provide the world with relatively cheap and clean power, an ambition that remains unfulfilled. He was also one of the participants in the award-winning Up series of TV films. This began in 1964, when a researcher was struggling to find a rural child who would talk to the camera for an edition of Granada TV’s World in Action programme called Seven Up! It featured children aged seven from differing backgrounds giving their views on various subjects. Directed to the one-room Arncliffe CE primary school in Littondale, North Yorkshire, the researcher was told Nick would definitely talk, but he was only six. He said that was near enough, and Nick was filmed explaining that he wanted to learn about the Moon, though he refused to say what he thought about girls. It was meant to be a one-off programme, but the cameras returned for a follow-up, 7 Plus Seven, and then every seven years after that. Nick was born in Skipton, the eldest of the three sons of Iona (nee Hall) and Guy Hitchon, who farmed in the Littondale hamlet of Hawkswick. When the next instalment of Up was filmed, Nick was actually 13 and at Ermysted’s grammar school, Skipton, where his love of science was flourishing, he captained the rugby first XV and played for a Yorkshire Schools team. From there he went to Merton College, Oxford, to study physics, gaining his DPhil at the age of 23. He was about to make a major change, as he moved to the US in 1982 with his first wife, Jacqui Bush, to continue his work on nuclear fusion at the University of Wisconsin. Nick and Jacqui later divorced. He remained at the university’s Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering for four decades, becoming a full professor in 1994 and department chair from 1999 to 2002. He was the author of more than 100 articles and three books in his specialist field. Nick participated in all the Up series films. Though he felt poorly represented in some of the early programmes and always found the interviews uncomfortable, he brought the same commitment to making the films as he did to other areas of his life. Nick was diagnosed with cancer five years ago but was determined to live as full a life as possible, only retiring from the university in the spring of 2022. He is survived by his second wife, Cryss Brunner, whom he married in 2001, and his son, Adam, from his first marriage, and by his brothers, Chris and me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jul/07/scottish-governments-drugs-proposal-is-new-wrangle-over-devolved-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-07T16:05:21Z","webTitle":"Scottish government’s drugs proposal is new wrangle over devolved powers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/07/scottish-governments-drugs-proposal-is-new-wrangle-over-devolved-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jul/07/scottish-governments-drugs-proposal-is-new-wrangle-over-devolved-powers","fields":{"bodyText":"It is a constitutional two-step that is wearyingly familiar: the Scottish government puts forward a proposal it presents as an innovative solution to a pressing problem, if only Westminster would allow some flexibility and grant it the necessary powers … and the UK government responds immediately in the negative. The tune may vary – be it a deposit return scheme, gender recognition reform, or indeed the opportunity to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence – but the steps are the same every time. And so on Friday the Scottish government’s challenge to their UK counterparts to decriminalise drugs for personal use, or devolve to Holyrood the powers to do so themselves, met perhaps understandable cynicism. Surely the UK government would say no? It did, categorically, within the hour – so why make such a show of asking in the first place? Context is all, and it is worth noting that the announcement, flagged by Scottish ministers and their supporters as radical and ambitious, was made on the day that the first minister, Humza Yousaf, celebrated his first 100 days in office. During a turbulent early tenure, dominated by the continuing police investigation into SNP finances, Yousaf has been keen to distinguish himself from his predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon. Despite running his leadership contest as “the continuity candidate”, he has scrapped or substantially revised a series of her government’s flagship policies. But on her pledge to challenge the UK government’s veto on Holyrood’s gender reform bill, he has stood firm. Regardless of the substance of the bill, Yousaf has said, the precedent of Westminster blocking legislation passed by a majority of the Holyrood parliament is a dangerous one. The Scottish government says it is profoundly concerned about what it sees as increasingly unguarded attacks on the devolution settlement, and an exercise such as today’s confirms there is no room for negotiation as far as Westminster is concerned. Labour’s response similarly gave short shrift. It links with a question posed repeatedly at the SNP’s recent independence convention: if it is indeed a voluntary union, as the UK government claims, then how do you leave it when Westminster continually refuses another vote on the subject? The SNP has increasingly been basing its argument for independence around the democratic principle that Scots should have the right to be asked the question again. The response from the prime minister’s spokesperson on Friday afternoon, shooting down the drug reform proposals while admitting he had not actually seen the report, only bolsters these arguments about Westminster’s unthinking intransigence, particularly, Yousaf will be hoping, for previous SNP voters now drawn to Labour. But those closer to the drug policy sector suggest it is possible to over-interpret the constitutional context. Elena Whitham, Scotland’s drug policy minister, made the announcement flanked by key members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, which is holding its AGM in Edinburgh. It suggested that the timing of the announcement was more to do with seizing the opportunity of global support, and being able to place the Scottish government’s demands within the international context of growing support for decriminalisation. Nonetheless, the frustration among charities and specialists is plain that improvements that could be made now are overshadowed by wrangling about Westminster’s obstinacy. And with the next drug death figures due on 22 August, the Scottish government remains under huge pressure to deliver on its “national mission” to save lives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/jul/07/they-review-john-rylands-library-manchester-maxine-peake","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-07T10:05:13Z","webTitle":"They review – Maxine Peake’s powerful delivery leaves us wanting more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jul/07/they-review-john-rylands-library-manchester-maxine-peake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/jul/07/they-review-john-rylands-library-manchester-maxine-peake","fields":{"bodyText":"It is eerily fitting that a dystopian tale in which books are banned and writers are under threat of having their hands amputated is staged in one of Manchester’s most revered libraries. For the Manchester international festival, Maxine Peake, Sarah Frankcom and Imogen Knight have co-adapted Kay Dick’s recently re-issued 1977 novel to stage within John Rylands Library’s gloomy, grand neogothic interior. The story, delivered as a dramatised reading by Peake, is of a world in which culture is obliterated by authoritarian forces and artists criminalised. Peake plays a poet who sees horrors unfold around her, and encounters artists who have been punished for their art (painters blinded, musicians made deaf) and those who resist. The nave-like room is the perfect place for the piece, housing such precious tomes as an early manuscript of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and a fragment of The Gospel of John, and symbolically infusing books with a sense of the sacred. The stage is arranged as a narrow traverse which Peake walks along, quiveringly, throwing sheaves of script on the floor. She is pale and shoeless, but there is a controlled inner outrage to her character as she speaks of fellow artists who are intent on congregating and creating work despite the risks. In between telling her story she stops to repeat the names of the dead and it feels liturgical. Reports of violence come in flashes: dogs with broken necks, writers whose hands are forced into fires. Peake is caught within the harsh glare of Amy Mae’s lighting design, which spotlights her as if in an interrogation. Her voice carries the hollow edge of the library’s acoustics and Melanie Wilson’s composition and sound design builds dread. They is thoroughly atmospheric and bears obvious resonances to erosions of creative freedoms around the world today. But at under an hour, it is rather too short and sketchy, with a narrative arc which creates intrigue but does not stretch very far. We hear that love and nonconformity are outlawed and want more detail. Peake wonders if her group of friends can simply create for themselves, leaving paintings to hang in their studios, which begs questions around what and who art is for, but the show does not delve further. It is testimony to Peake’s powerful delivery that we are left wanting more. She reels us in, as she always does and holds us in a state of bated breath. • At John Rylands Library, Manchester, until 9 July.

The plant was captured in early May by Russian forces, who are reportedly storing equipment at Europe’s largest nuclear facility, but is still being run by Ukrainian technicians under the gaze of occupying forces. Three of the four power connections the plant relies on to keep its reactors cool were previously cut during fighting, and on Thursday, fires around the plant that Zelenskiy blamed on Russian shelling brought down the fourth, disconnecting it for the first time in its history. Russia blamed Ukrainian shelling and on Friday said it had destroyed the gun responsible. Zelenskiy said the disconnection had put “Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster”. Ukraine’s authorities said backup systems had kicked in to ensure the cooling and safety systems at the plant but as of Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. “Zaporizhzhia NPP nuclear power professionals are real heroes! They tirelessly and tightly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,” wrote Energoatom on its Telegram channel. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. Ukrainian authorities and international experts have consistently warned of the potential for nuclear catastrophe because of fighting around the facility, which sits close to the frontlines in the south. Disconnecting from the grid raises the risk of a catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. A nuclear incident could have disastrous consequences for the immediate population and clouds of radiation could travel across Europe. A mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to visit the plant next week to monitor the situation and take protective measures, said Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, on Ukraine’s Radio NV. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had received assurances from Zelenskiy and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, that the mission would be allowed to reach the plant safely. But Zerkal said she remained sceptical that the mission would reach it. “All the logistical routes are now being worked out,” Zerkal said. “Despite the fact that the Russians agreed that the mission will go through Ukrainian territory, they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission does not reach the object given the situation around [the plant].” Civilians across Ukraine’s south who rely on the plant for electricity, including those in the occupied territories, have experienced power outages with the disconnection of the plant. More that 18,000 people in 72 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were without power as on Friday, the regional administration said. People living in occupied areas already face severe problems accessing medicine, basic goods, information and freedom of movement, and those who disagree politically face repressive measures from the new administration. Thousands living along the contact line have been caught up in shelling. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over whose shells have damaged the power plant and the surrounding area. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia was using the plant as a military base and Washington’s Institute for the Study of War said that Russia had failed to present evidence that the shelling was caused by Ukraine, despite the fact they controlled the territory. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, the plant must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If these break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative impasse, with no significant territorial gains or losses in the last two months. This week, Putin signed a decree to increase the size of the Russian army by 137,000 men, and the UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday it believed he had fired six generals for advancing too slowly. Also on Friday, Ukraine said it would expand the number of districts on the frontline where civilian evacuations would be mandatory, as those areas could be occupied and face central heating problems this winter. Russia’s takeover of the plant is the latest in a long list of challenges Russia and its occupying authorities are facing in running newly conquered territories. Ukrainians continue to use the western-supplied long-range missiles to target infrastructure within enemy lines. Explosions could be heard in occupied Kherson on Friday afternoon as Ukraine’s southern command said it had successfully disabled the Dariiv Bridge to the north of the city. Russia’s RIA news agency reported that the Russian air defence systems had been activated. It is not clear if the two incidents were connected. Video footage released on Thursday show the occupying authorities are attempting to build a pontoon bridge across the river to replace the Antonovskiy Bridge struck by Ukrainian forces last month, rendering it unusable. Russian authorities will hold referendums in newly occupied parts of southern Ukraine, although it appears they will take different forms and may be conducted on different dates. In the city of Melitopol in the occupied-Zaporizhzhia region, pollsters will go door-to-door instead of voters attending polling stations, according to its mayor-in-exile, Ivan Fedorov, citing sources on the ground. Authorities are trying to operate while apparently being attacked from within. RIA reported that a bomb exploded in the building from where the referendum was being planned and Russian passports were issued. In the occupied southern city of Berdiansk, the deputy head of the traffic police was killed on Friday by an explosion, Russia’s state news agency, Tass, reported. On Wednesday, Ivan Sushko, the head of another occupied city nearby, was killed by a car bomb, occupying authorities reported on Telegram. Their deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations that have targeted members of the occupying authorities. On 23 August, Ihor Telehin, the deputy head of the internal policy department for the occupied Kherson region, was also targeted with a bomb but survived, according to Tass."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-10T11:00:04Z","webTitle":"Democrat accuses Republicans of ‘power grab’ in North Carolina voting rights cases","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/10/north-carolina-voting-rights-cases-supreme-court","fields":{"bodyText":"The North Carolina supreme court agreed to rehear two major voting rights cases in recent days, an unusual move that one Democrat on the court bluntly described as a “power grab” by the new Republican majority. The court will reconsider two recent rulings that struck down the state’s voter ID law and congressional districts. Both of those decisions were losses for Republicans, who both enacted the ID law and drew the districts to give their candidates a significant advantage in elections. The rulings came down when Democrats had a 4-3 majority on the court, but in November, Republicans flipped control of the court and now have a 5-2 advantage. The court will rehear the cases in March. The decision could also upend a blockbuster case pending at the supreme court that would dramatically reshape US election law. The unusual decision to rehear the cases is the latest in a series of rulings that underscore the increasingly powerful role state supreme courts are taking on in redistricting disputes. State supreme courts in Ohio and Wisconsin have also played critical roles in this issue recently. Last year, the North Carolina supreme court court struck down state legislative districts as well as congressional plan that would have given Republicans control of 11 of the state’s 14 congressional districts. The map that was ultimately in place in November led to a 7-7 split in the seats. In December, the court struck down a law that would have required voters in the state to provide one form of acceptable photo ID, saying it was passed to discriminate against Black people. Justice Trey Allen, a Republican elected last year, said on Friday that by choosing to rehear those cases, the court was “exercising our duty and authority to address alleged errors of law”. But Anita Earls, one of two remaining Democrats on the court, harshly criticized that decision in a scathing dissent. Over the last 30 years, the court has received 214 requests to rehear cases and only granted two of them. “Nothing has changed since we rendered our opinion in this case on 16 December 2022: the legal issues are the same; the evidence is the same; and the controlling law is the same. The only thing that has changed is the political composition of the court,” she wrote. “It took this court just one month to send a smoke signal to the public that our decisions are fleeting, and our precedent is only as enduring as the terms of the justices who sit on the bench. “The majority has cloaked its power grab with a thin veil of mischaracterized legal authorities. I write to make clear that the emperor has no clothes.” Mitchell Brown, a senior attorney at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which challenged both the maps and the ID laws, said the rare decision to rehear the cases was “very strange”. “The voting rights wins that we won, voters won in North Carolina have a good chance of being reversed both with voter ID and redistricting,” he said. “If that’s the case that whoever is sitting in the seat can change the law on a whim and not respect precedent, then that’s going to make it hard for people to adjust their conduct to follow the law,” he added. “Because all they have to do is say we’ll follow the law now but we’ll do something different later.” The decision to rehear also could have consequences in the US supreme court. In December, the court heard an argument from North Carolina Republicans who said that state courts did not have the constitutional authority to alter district boundaries or rules for federal elections. It’s an argument based on a novel legal theory, called the independent state legislature theory (ISL), and if the court were to endorse it, it would be a major boon for Republicans. Because the state supreme court is now rehearing the case, the US supreme court could now decide that the issues before it are moot, punting the underlying issues into the future. Doing so would be a mistake, Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California Los Angeles, wrote in a post for Slate. The underlying dispute over the power of state courts when it comes to federal elections is likely to keep coming up until the US supreme court says something clear about it. “It is far better for this ISL theory to be resolved when it is not in the context of a disputed presidential election,” he wrote. J Michael Luttig, a well-respected former federal appellate judge, tweeted on Monday that the decision to rehear the case did not necessarily make moot the case before the US supreme court. “For a state supreme court to overrule one of its decisions while it is pending imminent decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, would be an act of judicial and political hubris – not to mention disrespect for the U.S. Supreme Court – that I do not believe any state supreme court would do on the eve of the Supreme Court’s decision,” he tweeted. Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, also told NPR that the US supreme court could still issue a ruling on the case. The North Carolina supreme court could wait to issue a ruling in its case until after the US supreme court does. “There’s a little bit of a game of chicken,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T17:58:55Z","webTitle":"Energy contracts reform can bring prices down – if the new PM is tough enough | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","fields":{"bodyText":"Welcome news: a consensus is emerging around one way to attack energy costs – stop paying sky-high prices for electricity that is generated in the UK by firms whose costs are unaffected by soaring gas prices. We’re talking about nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar projects and biomass facilities, some of which are making fortunes thanks to the UK’s outdated wholesale energy pricing system. The basic problem, revealed starkly by the crisis, is that electricity in the UK is tied to global gas prices. When the gas price spikes, as now, it has perverse consequences: a nuclear power station is paid as if its input costs had just risen fivefold, when they plainly haven’t. This “clearing price” setup was designed for another age – not one where nuclear and renewables together produce about 60% of electricity in the UK. One idea to crack the problem in the short term (ie before the government settles on a method to decouple gas and electricity prices, which is the plan) was sketched out here on Tuesday. Academics at the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), followed by the consultancy Cornwall Insight, have been pushing the idea of shifting as many UK generators as possible onto contracts for difference, or CfDs. Under CfDs, the problem of overpayments doesn’t arise: when wholesale prices are above a fixed “strike” price, the projects return cash to be recycled into lowering bills. But the CfD setup has been only been widely used since 2017. Before then, the main system for encouraging investment in renewables was renewable obligation certificates, or ROCs, which are still attached to 40% of UK electricity generation. Such projects get the wholesale price plus, for instance, one ROC worth at least £50 per megawatt hour. The arrangement looked roughly fair when wholesale prices were £100 per megawatt hour, but, at £400-plus, somebody is raking in undeserved and unintended windfalls. If it’s not the owner, then it’s middlemen who bought the power via forward-selling arrangements. Thus a switch to CfDs has right on its side. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday that the government is looking at a voluntary shift to CfDs, albeit one that won’t be ready until next year in order to get around the forward-selling wrinkles. The lure to developers would be a 15-year contract that guarantees still-profitable terms when the current emergency has passed and (we hope) gas prices plunge. That sounds roughly like the original UKERC proposal from April. And Energy UK, the trade body, says the industry is backing the plan. All that is welcome – it is movement in the right direction. But, before anyone gets the idea that salvation has arrived, two related points needed to be made. First, the obvious one: the savings may not be huge if ROC generators don’t all sign up for CfDs, or if the new contracts are too generous. Energy UK is projecting only £150-£250 for a typical household, albeit businesses would also benefit. So the second issue is how robust the government wishes to be. A blistering letter in the Times this week from five former energy bosses, including former chiefs of Shell, National Grid and BG Group, backed a more radical idea to address the same core problem: just cap the prices of domestic electricity produced by non-gas generators. The firms could still make returns “that reflect the investment risk”, but energy prices would be reduced at source. Yes, that idea indicates what could be possible with a bit of arm-twisting. An invitation to generators to enter a “voluntary” negotiation is far more likely to produce big savings if it is accompanied with the threat of a windfall tax. The picture is riddled with politics, it should be said. A contract for 15 years is less appealing if your nuclear power station is due to close in five; and the 80% owner of the existing nuclear fleet is EDF, under the control of the French state. Therein lies an awkward negotiation, just as commercial terms for EDF-backed Sizewell C are on the table. And getting nuclear to sign up would be crucial to maximising savings – it is the big player. But the bottom line here is that tackling prices in the wholesale generation market looks an open goal for an incoming prime minister. Some versions of the CfD suggest average household savings of £500-£600 would be possible with maximum corporate participation. But it would require an incoming PM to, first, recognise the problem; and, second, be willing to face down vested interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/24/they-wont-buy-it-fish-traders-anxious-after-fukushima-wastewater-release","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-24T13:52:27Z","webTitle":"‘They won’t buy it’: fish traders anxious after Fukushima wastewater release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/24/they-wont-buy-it-fish-traders-anxious-after-fukushima-wastewater-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/24/they-wont-buy-it-fish-traders-anxious-after-fukushima-wastewater-release","fields":{"bodyText":"Awa-jinja is a place of pilgrimage for the more superstitious fishers of Shinchi-machi, a coastal town in Fukushima, who come here to lower their heads and ask the Shinto gods to look kindly on them as they prepare to steer their boats into the vast Pacific Ocean. Today, though, the “safe waves” implicit in the shrine’s name are of little concern to the men and women coming to the end of the working day at the town’s fishing port. “That has only just started, and prices were already down at auction this morning,” says Haruko, a fish trader, as she sits in the shade with a carton of fruit juice while other workers hose down the concrete forecourt. “That,” she indicates with the wave of a hand in the direction of the sea, is the start of the most controversial stage in the long, and fraught, task of decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after it was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, which caused three of its reactors to go into meltdown. In images broadcast live online on Thursday, engineers behind computer screens opened valves to allow the first batch of 1.3m tonnes of wastewater from the plant to flow into the sea. “Our family eats seafood from Fukushima all the time, but now I hear people say that they won’t buy it,” says Haruko, a mother of three who declined to give her family name. “They certainly don’t want to give it to their children. And if people stop buying fish from Fukushima, I’m out of a job.” China’s decision to ban all Japanese seafood in response to the discharge added to fears among people in coastal communities near the stricken plant that pumping “contaminated” water into the sea will sound the death knell for the local fishing industry. “The fishing communities of Japan are feeling increasingly anxious as they witness this moment” despite government assurances, the head of the country’s fisheries co-operative said in a statement. The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), uses on-site filtration to reduce amounts of more than 60 radionuclides to government-set releasable levels. But the technology is unable to do the same to tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that Japanese officials backed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and many scientists, insist has no detrimental effect on human health in low doses. Haruo Ono, 71, who has fished off the Fukushima coast since he was 15, says government assurances will do nothing to protect him and other fishers from harmful rumours over the safety of their catch. He says fishing cooperatives across Fukushima are united in the belief that pumping the water – enough to fill of 540 Olympic swimming pools – into the ocean will undermine more than a decade of work to revive their industry. “We were 100% opposed the water release, we still oppose it, and we will continue to oppose it,” says Ono, whose brother died in the triple disaster. “The government hasn’t listened to fishing communities in deciding how to deal with the water. It has abandoned the people of Fukushima to protect Tepco.” While many in Fukushima accept the science behind the decision to discharge diluted wastewater into the sea over the next 30 to 40 years, they believe Japan’s government has failed to convince consumers that their catch is safe. The government has allocated ¥80bn ($550m) to support fisheries and seafood processing and address potential reputational damage. But Ono, who will fish for flounder, mackerel and whitebait next week, said he would rather work without fear than depend on financial support. “That’s my job,” he says. “The sea is our workplace … it’s where we go to make a living.” Tepco’s announcement that it had begun releasing the water did not deter anglers dotted along a jetty south of the port. “I come here three times a week, and I plan to keep coming,” said one, referring to himself as Morimoto. “I eat migratory fish I catch, but I’m cautious about bottom feeders,” he said, nodding in the direction of Fukushima Daiichi, 30 miles to the south. “I fish for fun, but I feel sorry for people who depend on it for their livelihoods.” On nearby Odohama beach, Takayuki Endo is braving the fierce early afternoon sunshine, casting his lines into the Pacific in the hope of catching a flounder to take home for dinner. “They only just started releasing the water today, so perhaps my fish won’t be affected yet,” he jokes. “I accept the scientific explanations about why the tritium doesn’t pose a risk, but this is all about natural human reactions,” the 48-year-old adds. “And my gut feeling is that what Tepco and the government are doing isn’t right.” Even so, he has no intention of removing local seafood from his diet. “If I thought it was going to impact my health in the short-term, then I wouldn’t touch it. But the science says that isn’t going to happen, if at all,” says Endo, who stopped fishing off Fukushima for several years after the nuclear meltdown, only returning to his favourite spot on the beach three years ago. After the chaos and destruction of the triple disaster – in which more than 18,000 people died, most of them in the tsunami that laid waste to Japan’s north-east coast – fishing cooperatives were beginning to sense that better days were ahead. “Prices were rising and we were rebuilding our brand,” says Ono, whose three sons followed him into the fishing industry. “We could see a happy ending, but that’s been taken away from us by what happened today. But we will carry on fishing … and fighting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant temporarily disconnected from grid; death toll from Russian strike on rail station rises to 25 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said the power line was restored and was “currently up again”. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the IAEA could travel on a mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next '“coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to do to the plant. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station on Wednesday. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine”, she said in a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said she was “truly shocked” by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. The hundreds of cluster munition attacks that have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred show a “blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms”, the Cluster Munition Coalition said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel on a mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next coming days. Galushchenko told Reuters: A visit is planned. We are talking about the coming days - this is definitely no later than the beginning of September. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. The new package is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date, bringing to over $13bn the total the US has supplied or pledged to Kyiv under the Biden administration. The last regular power line supplying electricity to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been restored, according to the UN nuclear watchdog, citing Ukraine. It comes after Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: Ukraine told the IAEA that the ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, at least twice lost connection to the power line during the day but that it was currently up again. A Soviet-era monument in the Latvian capital, Riga, has been demolished after the memorial became a rallying point for supporters of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Demolition machinery was used to remove the 79-meter second world war memorial, built in 1985. Latvia’s parliament voted to remove all remaining Soviet statues, plaques and bas-reliefs by mid-November, despite protests from the country’s ethnic Russian minority to keep the memorial. The Hague in the Netherlands has said it will ask for a temporary exemption of EU sanctions against Russia, as it struggles to find a new gas supplier to replace the Russian supplier Gazprom. The city said it held an EU-wide tender in June and July, but failed to attract any bids from potential suppliers, Reuters reports. In a letter to the city council, alderman, Saskia Bruines, wrote: We will ask for an exemption for our current arrangement until 1 Jan. 2023 to guarantee the safety of supply and to facilitate negotiations. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. It affirms Starmer’s support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia and proposes he travels to Kyiv and hold talks with Zelenskiy. The proposed trip follows a previous visit by Starmer to the Polish border, and to visit British troops in Estonia to affirm Labour’s “unshakeable” commitment to Nato. The letter sets out Starmer’s previous meetings with prominent international figures. Sources in the Ukrainian government suggest a date for Starmer’s trip has not yet been agreed, despite what one said was a shortage in August of high-profile foreign guests. They expressed some reservations about not wanting to antagonise the Conservative party after having received strong support from Boris Johnson and his likely successor Liz Truss. However, it is understood the principle of the trip has been agreed and organisational planning is under way, with Starmer looking likely to undertake the journey later this year.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid on Thursday, for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power operator Energoatom said. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant. Three other lines had already been taken out in months of fighting. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” the company said in a statement. The nuclear power plant needs electricity to run cooling systems for the reactors and spent fuel rods. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. During the outage, the plant still got supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connecting the plant to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. Energoatom’s chief on Wednesday told the Guardian that Russian engineers have drawn up a risky blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from its national grid, and connect it to the Russian power network instead. The plan is ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine are cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday, Petro Kotin said. Ukraine and world leaders have warned Russia against attempting to change connections at the plant. They have also called on it to demilitarise the area, after military vehicles were parked in turbine halls and other sensitive areas of the plant, potentially blocking access for firefighters. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. The order, which will come into effect on 1 January, includes a 137,000 rise in the number of combat personnel to 1.15 million. It marks a noticeable increase in army personnel since the last time Russia expanded the size of its military in 2017, when it added 13,698 military personnel and 5,357 non-combatants. The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement: I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine. Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or travelling with their families. In case you missed it earlier, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Its chief, Rafael Grossi, told France 24 TV on Thursday: “We are very, very close to that [gaining access to the facility].” It comes as the last two working reactors at the power plant were disconnected from Ukraine’s electricity grid on Thursday after nearby fires damaged overhead power lines. Ukrainian staff are still operating the plant but the site has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the six-month war. Each side has accused the other of shelling the site, fuelling international concern about the potential for a nuclear accident. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under occupation by Russian troops was disconnected from the national power supply on Thursday, the state energy operator said. In a statement, Energoatom said the plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after a power line was damaged by fires at ash pits in a nearby thermal power plant. Energoatom said: The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid - the first in the history of the plant. Three of the nuclear plant’s power lines “were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks” by Russian forces, the operator said. As a result, the two remaining working of the plant’s six reactors still functioning “were disconnected from the network”. The operator added that the plant’s security systems were working normally and work was under way to reconnect one of the reactor blocks to the grid. A 17-year-old boy has died after Russian shelling in the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, wrote on Telegram: Another massive enemy shelling in the city of Orikhiv and surrounding settlements. The occupier used artillery and fired several hours in a row. A 17-year-old boy died. He was seriously wounded and died on the way to hospital. A 66-year-old woman from the village of Preobrazhenka was seriously injured in the enemy attack. Dozens of private houses had also been destroyed as a result of the shelling, he added. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Fedorov said: Tonight, the headquarters of the occupiers in the village of Pryazovske was blown up. It was there that the Russians prepared for the ‘voting’ and issued Russian passports. Fedorov also claimed that very few people had taken up the offer of Russian passports, although he did not have an exact number. The Guardian has not been able to verify his claims. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. Russia classifies military deaths as state secrets and has not updated its official casualty figures regularly during the war in Ukraine. On 25 March, it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine, 6.8 million of whom have had to flee their country”, she said. Millions of others had been internally displaced, she added. Bachelet said: I call on the Russian president to halt the armed attack against Ukraine. The former Chilean president added that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant must be “immediately demilitarised”, adding: The fighting continues, amid almost unthinkable risks posed to civilians and the environment as hostilities are conducted close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. Hundreds of cluster munition attacks by Russian forces have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred, the Cluster Munition Coalition said in an annual report. Mary Wareham, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement cited by AFP: Russia’s extensive use of internationally banned cluster munitions in Ukraine demonstrates a blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, said his team is “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Asked by French television France 24 if talks on gaining access to the facility had succeeded, Grossi replied: We are very, very close to that. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief cautioned that the operation was “extremely complex” and said he hoped the mission would take place within “days”. Faced with the risk of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia, Grossi stressed that “we need to go there, we need to stabilise the situation, we need to ensure a presence of the IAEA soon”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has also publicly condemned the Russian rocket strike on the Chaplyne railway station. The attack on a train station full of civilians “fits a pattern of atrocities” by Russia, Blinken wrote on Twitter. Russia’s defence ministry has now confirmed its forces struck the Chaplyne railway station in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region on Wednesday. But the Russian ministry said the strike hit a military train that was set to deliver arms to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine says at least 25 civilians died in the Russian strike, which it says was aimed at residential areas. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has discussed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a telephone call with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, the Russian defence ministry has said. Shoigu informed Lecornu “about Russia’s stance on Ukraine’s actions” related to the nuclear power plant during the call earlier today, which was initiated by the French side, the ministry said in a statement. The Russian minister also “noted the importance of sending a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant” and said Russia was ready to provide the necessary assistance to the UN nuclear watchdog’s inspectors, the ministry added. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, has condemned a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station that killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens. Writing on Twitter, Borrell described the attack on Wednesday in the town of Chaplyne as “heinous” and vowed that those responsible “will be held accountable”. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. 25 people have now been confirmed dead after Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday, the Kyiv Independent reports. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. The western Synelnykove district in Dnipropetrovsk oblast has been shelled overnight with eight people injured so far, the Kyiv Independent reports. The southern Nikopol district was shelled with rockets and heavy artillery overnight, while a Russian missile was shot down near the city of Dnipro. Google’s subsidiary Jigsaw is to launch an anti-disinformation campaign aimed at tackling disinformation in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic about Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports. The campaign will run for one month and has been designed to establish resilience to anti-refugee rhetoric online. Google has conducted research with psychologists at two British universities and will work alongside academics, fact checkers, non-government organisations and disinformation experts on the project. It is 9am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy,after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments. Russia plans to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “There are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. Zelenskiy says Russia has placed the world “on the brink of a radiation disaster”. “The Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe a combat zone … Now all of Europe and all neighbouring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution,” he said in a Wednesday evening address. Zelenskiy also called for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to take “permanent control” of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. US president Joe Biden confirmed a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in military aid, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. US officials said the equipment, which will have to be ordered and will not be delivered for months or years, represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Ukraine for the third time since Russia invaded, urging the international community to “stay the course” in its support. Announcing £54m in support, he told Zelenskiy that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Other senior politicians from across Europe travelled to Kyiv to show their support in person. Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. “We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said. “We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Plans by Russian-backed authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol would be a “mockery of justice”, the US secretary of state spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,” he said on Wednesday. Russia has claimed that the slowing pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is deliberate and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said: “Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately.” Ukraine’s top military intelligence official, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia’s offensive was slowing because of moral and physical fatigue in its ranks and Moscow’s “exhausted” resource base. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. On 21 August, imagery indicated that Russia maintained an enhanced military presence at the site, with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres of reactor number five. Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries.” The head of the Kyiv regional military administration has issued an update regarding the series of explosions reported near the city earlier this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia launched a rocket attack on the Vyshgorod district north of the city centre. “Two arrivals were recorded,” Kuleba said seemingly in reference to Russian missiles. The regional head said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces earlier said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am on Thursday as residents were urged to seek shelter immediately. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Charlotte Graham-McLay brings us this report from Wellington. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. He had served in New Zealand’s army for 10 years, the military said in a written statement on Thursday. Abelen had previously deployed to Iraq and was based in Christchurch before he left for Ukraine. He had not told the defence force he was travelling to Ukraine or sought its permission. Two people who knew Abelen – one in Ukraine and another in New Zealand – told the Guardian he had enlisted with Ukraine’s international legion and had fought on the frontline of the conflict. They would not say how long Abelen had been in Ukraine, but it is understood to have been some months. New Zealand’s military would not comment on the circumstances of Abelen’s death because he was not on active duty, but his commanding officer said he was well liked and respected. The United Nations voiced similar alarm to Russian attempts to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol. UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva: Under international law, individuals entitled to prisoner of war status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the armed conflict, even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offence under domestic law.” She warned there are few details available about the potential for such trials, but that images posted by news outlets and on social media appear to show metal enclosures - possibly intended to confine the detainees - being built near a concert hall in Mariupol. The US has condemned any Russian effort to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied southern city of Mariupol, labelling the proceedings “illegitimate.” Reports surfaced this week that Moscow is considering prosecuting Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) under conditions that could amount to war crimes. US state department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement on Wednesday: The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them.” The Kremlin is attempting to deflect responsibility for President [Vladimir] Putin’s war of aggression and distract from overwhelming evidence of the atrocities Russian forces have committed in Ukraine… All members of Ukraine’s armed forces, including domestic and foreign volunteers incorporated into the armed forces, are entitled to prisoner of war status if they are captured and must be afforded the treatment and protections commensurate with that status, according to the Geneva Conventions.” The statement also called on Moscow to “comply with its obligations under international law.” Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. Spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said: We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Kirby said that holding referendums, intended as a prelude to annexation, was proving a challenge to Russian organisers in the face of the near-total opposition of Ukraine’s population. Our information is that Russian officials are so concerned that there will be a low voter turnout … that they’re trying to work on workarounds and how they would how they would communicate that,” he said, but did not describe what those “workarounds” might be. A detailed plan has been drawn up by Russia to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station, as the country marked a sombre independence day, and six months since Moscow’s invasion started. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. US President, Joe Biden, will speak with Ukrainian President, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, following the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the US would continue to “rally the free world” and “galvanise allies and partners” to support Ukraine as the Russian invasion hits the six-month mark. He said the phone call between Biden and Zelenskiy would reaffirm those commitments and would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments and congratulate him on Ukraine’s independence day, according to the White House. “The President’s looking forward to that,” Kirby said, while saying there were no travel plans to discuss for Biden to visit Kyiv. He said if a “trip makes sense,” it would come under consideration. Ukrainian officials are reporting explosions near Kyiv early this morning . Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard in the Vyshgorod district around 3am on Thursday, a district north of the city centre, in an alert issued via its official Telegram account. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, also issued a Telegram update, saying: We have information about several sounds of explosions in one of the communities of the Vyshgorod district. We are clarifying the information. Emergency services are already working.” Kuleba urged resident to seek shelter immediately. According to Ukraine’s emergency services, an air raid alert was issued throughout the region at 3.21am. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Ukrainian officials are reporting a series of explosions near Kyiv early this morning. Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard in the Vyshgorod district around 3am on Thursday, a district north of the city centre. It is 5am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: Russia plans to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station, as the country marked a sombre independence day, and six months since Moscow’s invasion started.

As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. Zelenskiy says Russia has placed the world “on the brink of a radiation disaster”. “It is a fact that the Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe a combat zone … Now all of Europe and all neighbouring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution,” he said in a Wednesday evening address. Zelenskiy also called for th UN’s nuclear watchdog to take “permanent control” of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. US president Joe Biden confirmed a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in military aid, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. US officials said the equipment, which will have to be ordered and will not be delivered for months or years, represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Ukraine for the third time since Russia invaded, urging the international community to “stay the course” in its support. Announcing £54m in support, he told Zelenskiy that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Other senior politicians from across Europe travelled to Kyiv to show their support in person. Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. “We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said. “We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Plans by Russian-backed authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol would be a “mockery of justice”, the US secretary of state spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,” he said on Wednesday. Russia has claimed that the slowing pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is deliberate, and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said: “Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately.” Ukraine’s top military intelligence official, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia’s offensive was slowing because of moral and physical fatigue in its ranks and Moscow’s “exhausted” resource base. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-11T16:00:24Z","webTitle":"‘Russia has lost its soft power’: how war in Ukraine destabilises old Soviet allies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/11/russia-has-lost-its-soft-power-how-war-in-ukraine-destabilises-old-soviet-allies","fields":{"bodyText":"As Georgian protesters marched on the country’s parliament against a new “foreign agents” law this week, they bore signs that said “No to Russian law!”, and others decrying the spirit of autocracy and imperialism that is now firmly associated with Moscow’s influence in the region. By all appearances, the law they opposed was a local initiative to allow the ruling Georgian Dream party to crack down on civil society and win forthcoming elections. But that party’s perceived closeness to Moscow and the similarities to a notorious Russian law against “foreign agents” were a popular rallying cry for Georgians who joined the protests. “Everybody knows that Russia is not popular here,” said Kornely Kakachia, a professor at Tbilisi State University and director of the Tbilisi-based Georgian Institute of Politics. “And [the protesters] also want to show Georgians what would be the result of this [law]. Just look at what has happened with Russia.” From Yerevan to Chișinău, and Tbilisi to Astana, the invasion of Ukraine has amplified fears of Russian aggression in some countries and forced others, considered allies, to at least reappraise Moscow’s role as a stable partner. And it has accelerated a trend among young people who were born after the Soviet Union era to take a more vocal stance against Russian influence in the region. “Russia has lost its soft power,” said Kakachia. “They don’t know how to use it any more with their neighbours. They just use this brutal force.” Russia’s actions have backfired in many ways. It has seen Ukraine receive unprecedented military aid from a US-led coalition; Finland and Sweden apply for Nato membership; and the west has shown unexpected fortitude in imposing sanctions on Moscow and resisting the use of Russian energy. Among Moscow’s near neighbours, years of work to cultivate political elites, develop a reliance on Russian security guarantees and instil local nostalgia for the Soviet Union have also been shaken by Russia’s gamble in Ukraine. “How do you live next to this kind of state that is toxic?” said Nargis Kassenova, director of the programme on central Asia at the Davis centre for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, speaking about Kazakhstan. “It’s difficult because the vulnerabilities are big and they are across the board. We can’t move out of the region, and we need to live next to Russia for ever. So we need to find some modus vivendi. It’s not easy, but maybe it’s a good chance to build up some sovereignty and decouple partially from Russia.” In 2020, Vladimir Putin negotiated a ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan in a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The settlement gave Moscow a military presence through 2,000 peacekeepers and painted Putin as a deft negotiator. Now, with Moscow’s attention focused firmly on Ukraine, tensions are rising again in the vacuum left behind, with Azerbaijan now appearing to be emboldened by Russia’s inactivity. Since December, Azerbaijani proxies have blocked the sole land corridor into the Nagorno-Karabakh region, leading to shortages of food and electricity there. And Russia’s own peacekeeping contingent, sidelined and potentially undersupplied, has not stepped in. “Not only is Russia distracted but it is simply overwhelmed by its failed invasion of Ukraine,” said Richard Giragosian, head of the Regional Studies Centre in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan. “Russia has lost the diplomatic initiative regarding Armenia-Azerbaijan, as well as Nagorno-Karabakh.” But Armenia remained heavily dependent on Russia for security, energy and trade, which had almost doubled in the last year. Directly challenging Russian influence in the country would be “suicidal”, Giragosian said. At the same time, the relationship has become far more unpredictable. “For Armenia, Russia has emerged as a much more serious challenge,” said Giragosian. “The challenge is that Russia has become an unreliable so-called partner, and the [Russian-led] Collective Security Treaty Organisation has become meaningless.” While Russia has appeared distracted from some of its foreign interests, it has increased pressure in other countries in an attempt to blackmail its leaders into loyalty or even provoke a new “Ukraine scenario”. In Moldova, President Maia Sandu has warned that Russia has been planning a coup d’etat. “The plan included sabotage and militarily-trained people disguised as civilians carrying out violent actions, attacks on government buildings and taking hostages,” Sandu said last month, during a press conference where she called for heightened security measures. The media in the Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria has claimed there has been a thwarted attempt to assassinate its leader, and the US has also warned that “Russian actors, some with current ties to Russian intelligence, are seeking to stage and use protests in Moldova as a basis to foment a manufactured insurrection against the Moldovan government”. Russia has been marshalling “energy dependency, church dependency, media, using hybrid aggression,” said Iulian Groza of the Institution for European Policies and Reforms in Chișinău. “Since the war started last year, all the security risks coming from Russia have been increasing. Russia’s imperialistic ambitions, apparently, were not only about Ukraine but about increasing its control and expanding its influence, including in Moldova.” While that was the case before the war, he said, threats of a “Ukraine scenario” were now coming directly from senior Russian officials, rather than just media propagandists. As he and others noted, Russia’s use of resources has come with costs for Moscow, alienating some of those in the country who were sympathetic to Russia, convincing Moldova to reduce its dependency on Russian gas despite the high costs involved, and increasing law enforcement scrutiny of political forces in the country, such as the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, whose political aims appear to align with Moscow’s. More broadly, the Russian strategy has moved toward strong-arm tactics rather than more subtle ways of spreading influence. “Russia has had to switch more and more from a strategy of using soft power and leverage … it was never that soft, but they didn’t need to rely on coercion all the time,” said Bob Deen, an expert on the region, and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank. “In Moldova, they cultivated links with numerous politicians, they have a massive presence in the media, a lot of Russian content gets rebroadcast, and there was a genuine affinity among a sizeable part of the population.” “All of that is diminishing really quickly because of the aggression against Ukraine,” he said, as Russia leveraged its control over gas flows and threatened political instability instead. In central Asia, which includes some of Moscow’s most committed partners, the war had also affected Russia’s image, said Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who is based in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. “For some people, [Russia] has seemed comparatively stable – now it’s seen more as an unpredictable country that is no longer the kind of role model that everyone wants to follow,” he said. The generational gap in views on Russia was particularly distinct, he said, with younger people “reflecting a lot on the history of their own countries”. At the same time, he added, the political leadership maintained “a huge element of trust with Russian political elites. I don’t see huge changes in this regard”. “We see that countries are being very pragmatic and using the current economic changes for their own good,” he said, pointing to growth in exports from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to Russia, and gas cooperation deals with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. “What central Asian countries want is to do just enough not to fall under secondary sanctions, and to extract as many possible bonuses out of the whole economic crisis,” he said. Leaders of countries that are even more dependent on Moscow, such as Tajikistan’s Emomali Rahmon, have delivered emotional demands for greater “respect”, including attention from Putin and investment. Russia has notably stepped up its diplomatic outreach to the region, with Putin visiting all five central Asian nations and holding more than 50 meetings (online and in person) with central Asian leaders in 2022. “Because the western direction is closed for Russia, they are more interested in central Asia,” said Kassenova. “We see a lot more attention from Russia, more high-level visits to all central Asian states. Their world shrank – where they can work and what they can do. And central Asia is where they can work,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/14/we-need-to-break-down-their-power-why-australian-music-is-facing-an-existential-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-13T15:00:49Z","webTitle":"‘We need to break down their power’: why Australian music is facing an ‘existential threat’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/14/we-need-to-break-down-their-power-why-australian-music-is-facing-an-existential-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/14/we-need-to-break-down-their-power-why-australian-music-is-facing-an-existential-threat","fields":{"bodyText":"In February, Australian TikTok users noticed a strange glitch: the app was limiting the number of songs some users could post. TikTok, it turned out, was using Australia as a test market to find out whether popular music was driving time spent on the app. The experiment finished in March, and TikTok Australia told the Guardian that only half of its users were impacted. But it left the local music industry rattled – providing a discomforting demonstration of the power wielded by the tech industry over artists. Australian musician Kota Banks, for instance, had been on the eve of releasing a new single. As she explained to fans in a post on her Instagram account, she wasn’t even able to post her own songs; she labelled the test “lazy and inconsiderate”. “It’s already so hard for Australian independent artists, and now we’re the test,” she said in her post. “It just feels wack to be a guinea pig.” The move by TikTok highlighted an increasingly urgent issue for new Australian music: it’s becoming harder and harder to reach audiences. Traditional channels such as radio and gigging still matter, but the explosive growth of TikTok in particular has given it a disproportionate power over the industry. As Los Angeles music industry maven Ari Herstand pointed out last year, “TikTok is currently the most powerful free promotional tool that musicians have at their disposal.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads In January, the federal government announced its long-awaited cultural policy, which included a new body to support the sector, Music Australia. At the policy launch, the federal arts minister, Tony Burke, drew attention to the fact that only two Australian artists featured on that week’s charts, with none in the top 20. One of Music Australia’s priorities, he said, would be to address the issue of discoverability – the ability for Australian listeners to find new Australian music – and to ensure that Australian music was “visible, discoverable and easily accessible across platforms to all Australians”. ‘We are creating a vacuum’: the music discovery crisis It’s been three months since Burke’s announcement and once again there are no Australian artists in the top 20 singles on the Aria charts and only two in the top 50 – both by the Kid Laroi. Across 2022, 296 songs appeared in the weekly top 50 singles – only 22 of which were Australian; and there were only five Australian songs among the top 50 most streamed tracks that year, and four among the 50 highest selling. Veteran music manager John Watson says there’s an “existential threat” facing Australian music. “Every year there are fewer and fewer songs being added to the great Australian songbook,” he says. It’s being driven by a confluence of factors, including the increasingly narrow reach of terrestrial radio and the dominance of tech platforms. Consumers who might once have fallen in love with an Australian act on radio or down at their local record store are now more likely to have a US or British act pushed to them by a digital algorithm. In this new landscape, an app with TikTok’s footprint becomes vital. According to market research firm We Are Social, the app reaches 32% of the Australian population aged 16-64, with Australian users scrolling out more than 23 hours per month – a 40% increase since the beginning of 2021. TikTok’s power as a vector for music virality has made it a focus for music labels and managers. “TikTok has really become a critical part of artist storytelling,” said Kristen Bender, a senior executive at Universal Music Group, in a 2021 webinar. Watson agrees. “TikTok is, in my mind, easily the number one place of music discovery, particularly for young people right now,” he says. James Clark from Digital Rights Watch Australia believes TikTok’s power is being driven by a consolidation of music industry power players. “We’ve lost a lot of the infrastructure like smaller labels, smaller curation – like community radio, music magazines, even venues – and now algorithmic curation is driving music discovery more than those human, communal projects,” he says. There’s been much discussion about algorithmic curation and the way in which tech platforms push certain products in front of consumers – but it’s begun to seem like algorithms may matter less on these platforms than more straightforward corporate decisions. At Audible, for instance, Amazon drove a calculated policy that gave listeners a free credit when they “returned” an audiobook they’d bought – in the process, bilking authors of royalty revenue. Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has also made a series of personal decisions affecting content on his site, even ordering Twitter engineers to boost the views of his own tweets. Decisions like these can have a massive impact on the careers of creators, who are beholden to the corporate owners of the platforms they rely on. On top of that, the algorithms themselves can be gamed. There is a vibrant grey market for songs on TikTok and Spotify, where influencers are happy to promote or playlist a new track on their next post – for the right price. On the other side of the equation, big-name pop artists such as Halsey, FKA twigs and Charlie XCX have complained about the incessant demands from labels and platforms for ever more posts. Last year, Halsey told her followers that her record label, Capitol, wouldn’t let her release her new single “unless they can fake a viral moment on TikTok”. Digital Rights Watch’s James Clark says the federal government needs to work harder on cultural regulations to protect local culture. “A thriving cultural scene is rooted in place. No great artist emerges from a vacuum … but we are creating a vacuum. “We need to see a bigger investment in public sector content, in the ABC, funding for community media, and ensuring there are vibrant public spaces out there,” Clark says. “These [digital platforms] capture audiences and then they capture creatives – we do need to look at how to break down their power.” ‘What are TikTok trying to prove?’ A number of prominent Australian labels and managers refused to comment for this story, an indication of the risk at play when criticising platforms they rely on. But Aria’s CEO Annabelle Herd tells Guardian Australia that while TikTok’s experiment only lasted a few weeks, it had “a real impact” on artists and “didn’t make any sense”. “We know music is such an important part of the platform,” she says. “What are they trying to prove, and why are they doing this to Australia?” Watson believes the app wanted to show artists that they needed TikTok more than TikTok needed them – and to build a stronger case when negotiating with record labels over music royalties, which TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, has only recently started paying. TikTok has also launched its SoundOn app in Australia, which it is selling as a creator-friendly platform for independent artists. “TikTok is seeking to show that by removing these artists from the platform, they can do more harm to the artists than the absence of the artists is doing to the platform,” Watson says. “That the benefits of quote unquote ‘exposure’ is such that artists should be willing to provide their content for free. “They’re trying to say: we don’t need that content, because people will continue to consume TikTok and they won’t notice if artist X or label Y is not on their platform.” The experiment may have proved the opposite. In March, Bloomberg reported the number of people using TikTok in Australia actually fell following the test, suggesting the platform still needs users to access the artists it had tried to cut out. But the essentially unregulated nature of tech platforms poses interesting questions for policymakers. The arts minister has signalled the federal government is moving to impose local content quotas on streaming video services, but their intentions for streaming audio are less clear. In February, Burke told the National Press Club he will send the issue to the newly created Music Australia for advice. The possibility of local quotas for TikTok in Australia may be the least of ByteDance’s concerns. In March, its CEO Shou Zi Chew was hauled before the US House of Representatives for tough questioning on the company’s practices and future. The US, UK and Europe have banned TikTok from government mobiles, and in April the Australian government followed suit. But for Australian musicians, the quota question across all platforms is becoming pressing – and the industry hopes the government will act on its promises. As Burke told the National Press Club: “The streaming services do not only have available what you might choose; they also push music to you. Getting inside those algorithms and getting a better deal for Australian music will make a huge difference for Australian artists.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T18:04:05Z","webTitle":"Dam collapse a global problem as waters may poison Black Sea, Zelenskiy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the ecological disaster triggered by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam has become a global problem as severely contaminated waters flow into the Black Sea. The Ukrainian president said the flood waters raging through the lower Dnipro River valley brought with them sewage, oil, chemicals and possibly anthrax from animal burial sites. “At least two anthrax burial places are in the temporarily occupied territories,” Zelenskiy said through an interpreter in an online discussion with environmental activists. “What is happening to those sites we do not know yet.” Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam on Tuesday morning and thereby committing ecocide. As well as the 100,000 people affected downstream, Zelinskiy said 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres) of forests had been flooded, and 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. “Altogether 2 million living beings are in danger,” Zelenskiy said, warning that as the contaminated water spreads, so would the environmental devastation. “The poisoning and contamination coming from the flooding area goes to the groundwater almost immediately, poisoning rivers and then the water basin of the Black Sea,” he said. “So it’s not happening somewhere else. It is all interrelated in the world.” Zelenskiy was speaking amid growing concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, about 125 miles (200km) upstream from the dam. The plant has drawn on the Kakhova reservoir to cool its reactor cores and spent fuel, but the reservoir is now rapidly draining into the lower Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said there is no immediate risk to the plant because it has water reserves, particularly a large cooling pond. However, a report by the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has said that earlier studies suggested the dyke around the cooling pond could collapse under the pressure of the water in it if the depth of the reservoir on the other side of the dyke dipped below 10 metres. It is currently below 13 metres and falling. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs were limited and in an emergency could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou said. However, nuclear experts warned the safety of the plant would then be extremely fragile. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear energy corporation, said the destruction of the dam meant the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant could also be under threat of Russian sabotage. “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. The relief effort on the Ukrainian-held right bank of the Dnipro continued on Thursday, as the official death toll rose to six. One person was killed and two injured as displaced people and relief workers came under artillery fire from the Russian side of the river. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy had criticised the UN and the Red Cross for failing to support the flood relief effort. On Thursday evening, he thanked international organisations for their help on the right bank but said they still had no presence in the Russian-occupied area where people were still trapped. As Ukraine struggled to contain the damage of the dam collapse on Thursday, fighting was intensifying along the frontline with Russian occupation forces. In particular, a substantial Ukrainian force, reportedly including western tanks and other equipment, appeared to be making a concerted push south of the city of Zaporizhzhia towards a Russian logistics hub in the town of Tokmak. The US press quoted unnamed US and Ukrainian officials as saying that Kyiv’s long-awaited counteroffensive had begun, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff said: “We have no such information.” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine’s hydro power corporation Ukrhydroenergo, which oversees the Kakhova dam, said the left bank would have to be liberated before reconstruction work could begin, but plans were already being drawn up in anticipation. “Water is continually flowing over it and destroying the foundation. Only when the water has calmed will we be able to see the extent of the destruction,” Syrota told the Guardian. He thought that would take 10 days. He said the next step would be to build a 15 metre-high buffer dam upstream of the ruined hydroelectric station so that work could start on building a new one. “It will take us four months to make the [buffer dam],” he said. “But we can start the work only after the liberation of this territory.” In a later interview with Ukrainian media, Syrota, said the construction time for the new buffer dam could be halved to two months “provided that we work 24/7”. Syrota dismissed suggestions that the dam could have been destroyed as result of partial damage that led to catastrophic structural failure, calling them Russian propaganda. “The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,” Syrota said. “To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.” He added: “In October 2022, the Russians kicked all the workers out of the station, and from then the facility produced no energy. It became just a fortification for the Russian military. They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined.

The Met Office issued a number of yellow and amber weather warnings for snow and ice on Tuesday, with Scotland expected to be the worst hit. An amber warning for heavy snow is in place for parts of eastern Scotland, including Inverness and Aberdeen, from 3pm on Tuesday, with the Met Office warning drivers are expected to become stranded. With up to 15cm of snow expected in the area, it said some rural communities could become cut off, there will be rail and air cancellations, mobile phone coverage may be affected and power cuts were likely. Yellow warnings for snow and ice are in place for Wales, Devon and Cornwall, the West Midlands, the north-west, south-western Scotland and Northern Ireland on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the public was urged to travel only if “absolutely essential” in some parts of the country. Avon and Somerset police said it was advising the public to stay off the roads after receiving more than 100 reports of road-related incidents in five hours. Fifty-three road traffic collisions were reported to police between 6-11pm on Monday, the majority a result of the freezing weather conditions. On Tuesday morning, a serious incident was declared after a doubledecker bus carrying 70 passengers overturned on the A39 in Somerset, leaving dozens injured. Supt Mark Runacres said: “We are advising the public to only travel where absolutely essential due to the treacherous driving conditions. If travel is necessary, we ask the public to take extreme caution and allow additional time to travel.” The Met Office said Monday night was the UK’s coldest of the year so far, with a low of -9.8C recorded in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire, and all of England is expected to experience cold weather until 9am on Friday. Jason Kelly, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “Cold, icy and sometimes snowy conditions are in the forecast this week with the UK seeing more of a north-westerly regime, with temperatures well below average for the time of year. Wintry showers are likely at points through the week in the north of England.” The UK Health Security Agency has also encouraged people to stay warm and look out for those most at risk from the effects of cold weather. Meanwhile, the Environment Agency (EA) said its officers were working around the clock to protect homes and businesses along the River Severn, with more than 25 flood warnings in place across Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. Across England, there were 83 flood warnings in place on Tuesday afternoon, meaning flooding is expected, with East Sussex, the Isle of Wight and other areas in south-east England predicted to be affected. The EA said rivers in the West Midlands and north-east England were likely to remain high for the next four days and could lead to further flooding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/aug/14/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review-the-most-powerful-folding-phone-tablet","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-14T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 review: the most powerful folding phone-tablet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/14/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review-the-most-powerful-folding-phone-tablet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/aug/14/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review-the-most-powerful-folding-phone-tablet","fields":{"bodyText":"Samsung’s latest folding phone-tablet sets new standards for the most hi-tech of gadgets – and with it comes a very high price tag. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 is an important update for Samsung in the face of stiff new competition from the Google Pixel line. The new folder costs £1,749 ($1,799.99/A$2,599), making it £100 more than last year’s excellent Fold 4 and the same eye-wateringly expensive price as Google’s Fold. These bleeding-edge devices are best thought of as more than just phones. Samsung pitches the Fold 5 as full PC, tablet and phone you can fold up and put in your pocket, and it is certainly the most multitalented Android device you can buy. The design has been refined since last year’s model, ditching the wedge shape and folding flat when closed owing to the same new hinge design as the Z Flip 5 – a big improvement. The device is thinner and 10g lighter than its predecessor, and the crease along the screen fold is less visible. It is still thicker than a regular phone, but it is only 13g heavier than an iPhone 14 Pro Max. It certainly feels less of a burden carried in the pocket and is significantly lighter than its key rival. The external 6.2in display is a little narrow, making the keyboard slightly cramped, but it is good-looking and works well enough for phone-related activities such as messaging, music and other quick things. For everything else, the 7.6in internal display remains a wonder to behold when unfolded. It is brighter than last year, which helps overcome glare outdoors. Samsung says a new design makes it 25% more durable than before, but like every other folding screen it is still softer than regular tablet glass so must be treated with care. Specifications Main screen: 7.6in QXGA+ 120Hz Amoled flexible display Cover screen: 6.2in HD+ 120Hz Amoled Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 RAM: 12GB of RAM Storage: 256, 512GB or 1TB Operating system: One UI 5.1 based on Android 13 Camera: 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto; 10MP and 4MP selfie cameras Connectivity: 5G, dual sim, esim, USB-C, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.3, GNSS Water resistance: IPX8 (1.5 metres for 30 minutes) Dimensions folded: 154.9 x 67.1 x 13.4mm Dimensions unfolded: 154.9 x 129.9 x 6.1mm Weight: 253g Rapid and long-lasting The Fold 5 has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip from the Galaxy S23 Ultra with 12GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful Android devices you can buy. Unlike most other phones, you might actually use all the power – running eight apps on screen at the same time will require all it has to offer. The battery lasts about 48 hours between charges when using a mix of the outside and inside screens for about six hours. This is better than last year’s model, much longer than the main competition and similar to the best regular phones. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone is generally repairable. Inside screen repairs cost £514, while the battery is replaceable by authorised service centres. Samsung offers a self-repair programme in the UK and US, as well as Care+ accidental damage insurance that reduces the cost of repairs to £115. The Fold 5 is made from recycled aluminium, glass and plastic. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Powerful software With key competition from Google’s Pixel Fold, software is Samsung’s big differentiator. Samsung’s One UI 5.1, based on Android 13, allows you to run three apps split screen at once, plus floating windows on top if you choose, which is a boon for productivity power users. The taskbar at the bottom of the screen makes it easy to put multiple apps on screen. The Fold 5 supports, but does not come with, Samsung’s excellent S Pen stylus for drawing and note taking, something no other foldable can manage. Apps can also be forced to fill the screen, not relying on the letterboxing with black bars on either side, which some rivals demand. Some apps, such as Gmail or Kindle, still require you to rotate the Fold 5 into landscape orientation to enable their two-pane view, however. There are also many more options to pick how things work compared with the Pixel Fold. For instance, you can have a separate home screen layout for the outside and inside displays, so you can put phone-related apps on the small screen and tablet-related apps on the large one. You can also choose which apps remain open and appear on the small screen when you shut them on the main screen, handy for maps on the go. The new “Flex Mode” panel allows you to push an app to the top half of the screen when it is folded in an L-shape and is a definite improvement. For most video apps, it shows playback controls such as a progress bar and skip buttons at the bottom half with the video above. With other apps it can turn into a trackpad for a mouse cursor – a bit like a tiny laptop. Samsung’s longstanding Dex mode, which produces a full Android desktop computer, can be used when the phone is plugged into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. For some, the Fold 5 could be the only computer they need. The foldable will receive at least five years of software updates from release, including four major Android version updates and monthly security patches. Camera The Fold 5 has five cameras in total, which are essentially the same as its predecessor. The combination is useful, with three good cameras on the back, a standard selfie camera in the outside screen and 4MP camera hidden under the folding screen, which is only good for video calls. The main cameras, including the 3x telephoto, shoot good images across a range of lighting conditions. The night mode is noticeably quicker than older models and the images are slightly sharper too. The Fold 5 still has plenty of tricks, such as shooting selfies with the main cameras and the ability to prop it up and capture hands-free photos and video. Overall, the cameras are good and about the same as those on Samsung’s S23, but cannot match the Pixel Fold for best cameras on a foldable. Price The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 starts at £1,749 ($1,799.99/A$2,599). For comparison, the Z Flip 5 costs £1,049, the S23 Ultra costs £1,249, the Google Pixel Fold costs £1,749 and the Honor Magic Vs costs £1,399.99. Verdict For its fifth generation, Samsung’s folding phone-tablet is lighter, thinner, feels better built and is a more mature device than ever. The Z Fold 5 is still extremely expensive – the price you pay for the still cutting-edge technology that makes the folding screen work – and it must be treated with more care than a standard phone. But it is one of the fastest and most adaptable devices you can fit in your pocket, with long battery life and the best folding display on the market. Samsung’s powerful software sets it apart, making it more productive and taking better advantage of the folding form even when apps are not specifically designed for it. The cameras cannot quite match the Google Pixel Fold and the thinner outer display makes the keyboard a bit more cramped for messaging. It is close, but overall the Fold 5 is the best folder you can buy, if you can stomach the wallet-emptying price. Pros: a phone and tablet in one, powerful multitasking abilities, phone-like outside screen, fantastic tablet screen, top performance, great battery life, water resistance, gap-free when closed and lighter. Cons: extremely expensive, more fragile than a regular device and costly to repair, no dust resistance, thicker than a normal phone, not a big leap over the previous generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-10T15:42:58Z","webTitle":"John Oliver on homeowners associations: ‘Glorified debt collectors with the power to upend your life’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/10/john-oliver-homeowners-associations-last-week-tonight","fields":{"bodyText":"John Oliver looked into American home ownership on Last Week Tonight, and particularly the private governing structure of homeowners associations (HOAs). (For millennials under 35 and unlikely to ever own a home – “sorry, that is the deal you made when you decided to be born after 1988,” Oliver quipped – Last Week Tonight prepared a segment on Chuck E Cheese.) But for everyone else, HOAs are a sneakily common force in daily life – 29% of the US population lives in community associations, and 82% of all single-family homes sold in 2021 were in one. They are also often widely loathed. Oliver pointed to one Facebook comment claiming good HOAs are “one vote away from hellish nightmares”, which is a “pretty intense comment”, he said. “It’s also the DNC’s sole campaign message for the last two elections.” Oliver then dug into what HOAs are and how they wield “surprising power” to “wreak havoc in people’s lives”. Formally, HOAs are run by an elected board of fellow homeowners. They collect dues averaging around $200-$300 a month to manage amenities such as pools and playgrounds, and can enforce architectural and landscaping guidelines often mandating a uniform aesthetic. Usually, such enforcement comes in the form of fines, which can be ludicrously applied. Oliver pointed to the example of one disabled veteran, whose HOA used Google maps to spy on his backyard and fine him for having a shed that was not approved, nor visible from the street. “If you’re relying on the achievements of the space program to find out what is in someone’s backyard, it’s probably not your business,” said Oliver. HOAs are often not voluntary – developers write them into deed restrictions, with automatic membership upon purchasing a new home. “And they’re set up as not-for-profit private corporations that can often function like a local government,” Oliver explained. “Basically, the way HOAs work is they get to set the rules and select the punishment for breaking them,” he said. “Think of it like Disney World. When you walk into the mouse’s house, you play by the mouse’s rules. And if you step out of line, Goofy is allowed to break your fucking knees. “HOAs can have the authority of a government and collect fees and fines like one,” he added, “but when it comes to accountability, they can actively resist it in ways that government officials could only dream about.” And they can reinforce the racial divides that have long plagued American home ownership. Oliver cited the example of an HOA in Denton county, Texas, which oversaw 2,200 homes and passed a rule that would ban renting to anyone using a publicly financed or subsidized housing program such as Section 8. The measure threatened to displace more than 150 families, 93% of which were Black. “I know that those HOA officials might not think of themselves as racists, but 93% is a pretty solid A for racism,” said Oliver. That policy is now under investigation, although there is no state or federal law that forbids HOAs from enacting such bans. “It’s basically a segregation loophole which, by the way, would be a pretty good slogan for the suburbs,” he noted. Even worse, the majority of the HOAs hire professional companies to handle their day-to-day needs. “The problem is, when you introduce for-profit companies to find problems in your neighborhood, things can change fast,” said Oliver, as people whose job it is to drive around and find infractions will find issues. Oliver cited the story of a woman charged $17,000 in late fees for infractions such as visible trash cans, an unsightly hose, lack of power washing and distasteful lawn art. Another “incredible power” that HOAs have over homeowners is the ability to foreclose on one’s home. Colorado’s HOAs for example, filed more than 2,400 foreclosure cases from January 2018 to February 2022. “Which is one of those things that sounds ridiculous but is absolutely true,” said Oliver, “like how there is four times as many chickens as people on Earth, or Lenny Kravitz is Al Roker’s second cousin, or that the first song Charlie Puth ever masturbated to was This Love by Maroon 5.” The nation’s 350,000 HOAs are largely unregulated, as the government considers disputes with them to be private matters. The state of New York’s attorney general’s office says “there is no government agency that can help unhappy owners who are having problems with their homeowners association,” adding “good luck!” “Which is basically just a cute way to say ‘you’re fucked!’” said Oliver “It’s like ‘you’re fucked’ washed her hair and put on a little church dress. “I’m not saying that all HOAs should immediately be gone,” said Oliver. “For a start, some people do like theirs and besides, right now local governments just aren’t equipped to suddenly take over the services like trash collection or maintenance that they provide. But at the very least, states should be looking for ways to avoid the worst possible outcome for homeowners who simply find themselves in a tough spot.” Oliver suggested measures such as mandating HOAs offer payment plans on unpaid debt before taking legal action and banning on foreclosures based on fines and attorneys fees. “At their best, HOAs are annoying student council adults telling you to trim your shrubs and move your trash cans,” he concluded. “But at their worst, they are glorified debt collectors with the power to upend your life and expel people from a neighborhood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T16:00:05Z","webTitle":"English hospitals make emergency plans amid winter power loss fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/12/english-hospitals-emergency-plans-power-nhs-trusts","fields":{"bodyText":"English hospitals have increased emergency fuel supplies and put staff on standby to postpone operations and switch off X-ray scanners amid heightened concerns over energy provision this winter. NHS hospital trusts across England have put their power plans under the microscope as they look to protect patients from potential outages for lifesaving equipment. Responses to freedom of information requests to 63 NHS trusts revealed that 41 are re-examining their plans for a loss of power for this winter. A further 10 trusts said they conducted routine reviews of their business continuity plans this year, while 12 had not revised their strategies. Concerns over the combination of a cold snap and a sudden cut-off in Russian gas supplies this winter have led ministers to examine power winter power supplies. National Grid warned in October that, in extreme circumstances, it would be forced to enact planned three-hour power cuts with a days’ notice. Major hospitals are exempt from this system, called rota disconnection, however businesses and the government have studied their plans for a complete power failure on the network. The Guardian revealed last month that Whitehall officials had “war gamed” emergency plans to cope with extended energy blackouts. Documents marked “official sensitive”, which warn that in a “reasonable worst-case scenario” all sectors including transport, food and water supply, communications and energy could be “severely disrupted” for up to a week. Despite the pressure on the NHS budgets, the responses show that most hospitals have up-to-date plans and backup generators to ensure lives are not lost due to lack of power. A quarter of hospital trusts said they were able to run indefinitely on backup diesel generator power, providing they had access to fuel supplies. Just over 10% said they could run on backup power for 10 days. St George’s University Hospitals, which serves 3.5 million people in south London, said its backup generators had eight to 12 hours of supply and it was in the “process of obtaining an additional contract for emergency oil supply”. The Royal Marsden, which has hospitals in London and Surrey, said its generators could run constantly and it is keeping a higher levels of fuel in existing tanks. Frimley Health, also in Surrey, has also increased fuel volumes. Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals in Surrey said it had brought in additional fuel suppliers, bought spare electrical parts in case of failure, developed “more detailed action cards”, and acquired other equipment for this winter. University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay, in north-west England, said that, in the event of planned power cuts, it would consider the “introduction of a shift system to align staff to the outage times”. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust in Kent said that, in the event of a loss of power, it would advise theatres and other specialists to “consider if they carry out essential procedures only”. The Royal Wolverhampton said if there were warnings of outages, staff would be advised to reduce or stop non-essential services. It added that some high-powered scanners and a linear accelerator used for cancer treatment, were not protected with essential power. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust plans to tell staff not to use kettles and microwaves during maintenance of key equipment, including defibrillators, to prevent unexpected power surges. The revised power plans come before what is expected to be another gruelling winter for NHS staff. The NHS will grind to a halt on 20 December under plans being discussed for a coordinated Christmas strike in England and Wales by nurses, ambulance workers and hospital staff. Energy companies have also been urged to protect at-risk consumers, including those on dialysis, from being cut off. National energy blackouts this winter would put more than 1.6 million people at heightened risk of a serious injury in their own home because of the poor quality of their property, an analysis from the Centre for Ageing Better reveals. Holly Holder, the deputy director for homes at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: “We are calling for the rollout of a national retrofit programme to make homes warmer, safer and more energy efficient.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-16T12:02:55Z","webTitle":"The case for a new Keynesianism when Labour returns to power | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jan/16/the-case-for-a-new-keynesianism-when-labour-returns-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"There is little point in James Meadway regretting Keir Starmer’s lack of spending commitments while maintaining the fiction that “spending increases will have to be met by at least some tax rises” (Keir Starmer may win power, but he won’t be able to turn the UK around on the cheap, 9 January). The government creates new money by instructing the Bank of England to credit private bank accounts to pay salaries, benefits, grants, etc. It needs neither taxes nor borrowing (its own money) to do this. Taxes cancel some of that money, but they have other important purposes. Tax rises to accommodate a “fiscal rule” serve no purpose. The government’s economic remit is to facilitate the fair and efficient allocation of the real resources available – in the world’s sixth-richest country, we have plenty. It does this by spending and by curbing the power of other economic actors via taxation and regulation. We had the same real resources after the financial crash as we did before. There was never a need for austerity. It is time that the monetarist policies that caused the crash were replaced by a new Keynesianism in this age of free-floating fiat money. Carol Wilcox Highcliffe, Dorset • It was very disappointing to read James Meadway, the director of the Progressive Economy Forum, perpetuating an underlying institutional myth about government expenditure. How do you know if it’s spending or investment? In popular political discourse, if money is being devoted to the creation of private profit, it’s investment, but if it’s being devoted to health, security and education, it’s spending. What nonsense. Intelligent investment is about allocating resources in the most effective way, which will sometimes be through the market, and very often through public services. Either way, if it’s done right, it’s investment, not pouring money down the drain. Please don’t reinforce the false paradigm that private expenditure is always wise and good, and public expenditure foolish and spendthrift.

Almost eight decades on, the spectre of nuclear war has returned with greater menace than at any time since the cold war, amid Vladimir Putin’s threats against Ukraine and North Korea’s seemingly unstoppable rise to the status of nuclear-armed state. Despite their advancing years, Mimaki and other survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and – three days later – Nagasaki are again urging world leaders to ensure that the human misery of nuclear warfare remains consigned to the final, catastrophic days of the Pacific war. “My greatest fear is that the Ukraine conflict will escalate,” Mimaki, 80, told the Guardian at the Hiroshima office of Hidankyo – a confederation of A-bomb survivor groups he has co-chaired since last year. “When I think about what Putin said recently, I wouldn’t be surprised if he used nuclear weapons. And what would the US response be? We could be on the verge of another world war. I don’t think Putin is listening.” The destruction of Hiroshima has become a gruesome reference point since Putin first threatened to use nuclear weapons in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from supporting Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion. The prospect that he could order the use of a smaller “battlefield” nuclear weapon to alter the course of the war in Moscow’s favour prompted Joe Biden to warn that the world was on the brink of “Armageddon” for the first time since the Cuban missile crisis. As Biden conceded this month that the US would soon be confronted by two major nuclear weapon states – Russia and China – North Korea claimed that its recent volley of missile tests were intended to simulate a tactical nuclear strike against South Korea. “The power of the Hiroshima peace message is as strong as ever, but its resonance is even greater given the current international situation,” said Makoto Kubo, assistant director of Hiroshima city’s international peace promotion department. “It isn’t just relevant to North Korea and Russia, but to every country that possesses nuclear weapons.” More than 60 countries have ratified a 2021 treaty to ban the possession and use of nuclear weapons, but they do not include any of the recognised nuclear states or countries, including Japan, that fall under the US nuclear umbrella. The failure to make progress on disarmament prompted the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, to warn in August that humanity was “in danger of forgetting the lessons forged in the terrifying fires of Hiroshima and Nagasaki”. The mayor of Nagasaki, Tomihisa Taue, said he feared the devastation visited on his city in 1945 had “not got across to the world well enough, and [is] looking to become a reality”. Drawing on faint memories and conversations with his mother, Mimaki knows those horrors only too well. He and his family were living in Tokyo when his father, who was from Hiroshima, evacuated them to his home town after large areas of the Japanese capital were destroyed in the March 1945 firebombings. Months later, the Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 15-kiloton nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, instantly killing between 60,000 and 80,000 people, with the death toll rising to 140,000 by the end of the year. Mimaki recalled watching, petrified, as people who had been in downtown Hiroshima when the bomb exploded passed his home, 17km from the centre, as they fled the fires that raged across the city, the air thick with radioactive ash. “Their hair had been burned off and they were begging for water,” he said. Today, the number of people officially recognised as having died from the effects of the Hiroshima bomb stands at just over 330,000, while the average age of the 118,000 survivors has crept up to 84. “I’m reasonably healthy, but I can sense my physical strength and memory weakening,” said Mimaki, who has taken his message to the UN headquarters and gives talks to schoolchildren about his experiences. “But our aim is still to achieve a world without nuclear weapons while we are still alive.” Hiroshima’s recovery began in the immediate aftermath of the attack; today, the burned-out shell of the “A-bomb dome” and the sprawling peace park are among the few physical reminders of the attack. It will have the opportunity to remind world leaders of the horrors of nuclear annihilation – whether in a Japanese city or, potentially, on a Ukrainian battlefield – when it hosts the G7 summit next May. “I want them to go to the peace museum and look at the photographs of children with their skin and clothes hanging off,” Mimaki said. “Let’s show them the reality of nuclear war, so that they go home with those images imprinted on their minds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-22T01:03:05Z","webTitle":"Australia must play an active role in ending nuclear arms race, cross-party MPs urge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/22/australia-must-play-an-active-role-in-ending-nuclear-arms-race-cross-party-mps-urge","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian MPs from across the political spectrum have called on the Albanese government to join a landmark treaty banning nuclear weapons, declaring that the weapons “fundamentally undermine our peace and humanity”. In a statement provided to Guardian Australia, a cross-party group of MPs warned of “escalating nuclear threats and provocations from nuclear-armed states” and said Australia must play an active role to end the nuclear arms race. The new treaty is a chance for Australia to stand with its neighbours in south-east Asia and the Pacific, according to the Labor MP Josh Wilson, the Liberal MP Russell Broadbent and the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John. Speaking out on the second anniversary of the UN treaty coming into force, the MPs said the agreement was supported by “the clear majority of our regional neighbours with whom we share a common goal of peace, cooperation, and security”. They called for Australia’s “timely signature and ratification”. “The members of this cross-party group are ready to work constructively with the Albanese government to ensure Australia becomes a state party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,” the MPs wrote. The US and other nuclear-armed countries are firmly against the treaty, which imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. But the treaty now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it is strongly backed by neighbours like Indonesia and New Zealand. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In opposition, Labor committed to sign and ratify the treaty, but only “after taking account” of several significant factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. Gem Romuld, the Australian director of the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the organisation hoped the cross-party statement would “spur the Albanese government on to fulfil its pre-election commitment”. “Nuclear disarmament is an urgent humanitarian issue above party politics,” Romuld said. “We can’t trust any of the nuclear-armed leaders to do the responsible thing and disarm; pressure from the global majority of nations, using the nuclear weapon ban treaty, is essential to move forward.” The MPs said the treaty was intended to create a new international norm on the illegitimacy of nuclear weapons. They said history showed “prohibition treaties on weapons of mass destruction are essential to facilitate progress towards their elimination”. Wilson, who is chair of the joint standing committee on treaties, said Australia’s peace and security was “massively improved when we help build and enhance the framework of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament”. He said the Albanese government had “wasted no time embarking on a serious and steady re-engagement” with both the longstanding nuclear non-proliferation treaty and also the newer ban treaty. Australia attended a key meeting in Vienna in June as an observer. In a symbolic step in October, Australia changed its voting position on an annual UN resolution regarding the treaty, shifting to “abstain” after five years of “no”. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the ban treaty “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security.” That was a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. But Indonesia’s ambassador, Siswo Pramono, said Australia’s positive shift on the treaty would “give encouragement to others to believe that we are on the right path” in seeking a world free of nuclear weapons. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, told the UN general assembly last year that Australia would “redouble our efforts” towards disarmament because Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-23T21:27:02Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi’s rock-star welcome to Sydney is part concert, part political rally and all about soft power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/24/narendra-modis-rock-star-welcome-to-sydney-is-part-concert-part-political-rally-and-all-about-soft-power","fields":{"bodyText":"It was a rock-star welcome that would have made any of the world’s biggest stars blush. But not Narendra Modi. Entering a heaving Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney’s west on Tuesday night, he was greeted by a roaring crowd who cheered and clapped throughout his speech. The Indian leader, who has been prime minister since 2014 and is vying for a third term at next year’s elections, spoke for nearly an hour, on both Australian-Indian relations as well as Indian economic and cultural successes. “There are three Cs that defined our relationship with Australia: the commonwealth, cricket and curry. But now it is three Ds: democracy, diaspora, dosti [friendship],” he started. “Now there are also three Es that define the relationship: energy, economy and education.” Modi went on to list popular eateries in Harris Park, a central suburb for the Indian diaspora in Sydney, much to the delight of the crowd: “I want you all to take my friend Australian PM Albanese to these places.” He said: “Mutual trust and mutual respect have not developed only due to the diplomatic relations of India-Australia. The real reason, the real power is – all of you Indians who live in Australia.” The arena event felt closer to a concert than a public appearance by two world leaders, as attendees held up flags and signs, and hung on Modi’s every word. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Organised by the Indian Australian Diaspora Foundation, the event ran for hours before the leaders arrived and featured dances and singing by local and international groups. At one point, a countdown was featured on the massive screens above the centre stage, with every update cheered by the crowd. “Man, this is awesome,” said Bhoomika Sampath, one of the volunteers at the event. “We are very proud of our country, we each hold on to that pride and want to be a part of it. We want to participate, and thats why we’re here.” The event resembled a political rally, with Modi regularly inviting the audience to cheer for India and its economic or cultural achievements, such as the size of the country’s workforce, the number of smartphones, the growth of fintech startups and the uptake of Covid vaccines. And while Modi covered a lot of ground, he did not mention the suppression of free media in India, with the Committee to Protect Journalists reporting 32 journalists and media workers killed since 2014. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party government is also accused of using repressive and intimidatory tactics against political opponents and civil society organisations, and of unlawfully discriminating against Muslims. None of these issues were addressed by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, or the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, who opened for Modi. His visit comes as the diaspora is exploding, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics forecasting the community will reach 1.07 million by 2035. Rajni Anand Luthra, from the local media platform Indian Link, said the repetition of lines about Indian success aimed to engage the local diaspora’s sense of identity and patriotism. “Indian soft power is so strong at the moment that something like this gives the community confidence and a big sense of identity, and you can see it in the way the community is changing,” Luthra said, adding: “We will play Bollywood music from our cars and bring our food into the office – the community is not shy about itself any more. And to attend an event with Albanese instills confidence in that identity.” Albanese, who announced the opening of the new Centre for Australia-India Relations in Parramatta, said he had never seen a reception like this. “The last time I saw someone on this stage was Bruce Springsteen and he did not get the welcome that prime minister Modi has got,” he said. “Prime minister Modi is the boss.” He said the centre would help foster stronger ties: “We want to see more connections, more Australian and Indian students living and studying in each other’s countries and bringing those experiences home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Police should be given power to charge suspects, say senior officers in England","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/27/police-should-be-given-power-to-charge-suspects-say-senior-officers-cps","fields":{"bodyText":"The police, rather than independent prosecution lawyers, should have the power to charge suspects in most cases, three senior police chiefs have said, as they warned of a deepening crisis in the justice system. The controversial change is being called for by the chief constables of the West Midlands, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire forces, respectively the second, third and fourth biggest in England after the Met, the Guardian has learned. They say the Crown Prosecution Service should be stripped of having the sole power to authorise charges in most cases, helping to drag the justice system out of a worsening crisis. This would include for crimes such as domestic abuse, harassment, burglary, robbery, theft, knife crime, and violent crime. The chiefs say delays in charging suspects are leading to the guilty walking free and delayed justice, as victims and witnesses tire of long waits. They say the CPS – which faced government cuts under austerity – should concentrate on the most serious cases, but is “far too thinly spread” to manage its current workload and increasingly complex cases. The police chiefs say sticking “plasters” no longer work and radical change – in effect a return to the way things were before the CPS was created in 1986 – is necessary and could be enacted quickly. In an unprecedented intervention, the three police chiefs say: “The ability for the CPS to give timely charging advice (namely while the suspect is under arrest and in the cells) is broken; not because of anything the CPS has done, but because they do not have the resources or the people to do what they used to. “We have tried to fix it together over the last two years, but the plasters are not sticking and things are getting worse. So for the sake of victims, witnesses and all in the criminal justice system, we need to replace it now, by restoring to the police the ability to charge most offences whilst suspects are in the cells.” The call is made by Craig Guildford who leads the West Midlands force, Stephen Watson of Greater Manchester police and John Robins of West Yorkshire police. All three senior police chiefs told the Guardian: “The director of public prosecutions needs to give the right back to the police to make charging decisions there and then in far more cases: domestic abuse, harassment, burglary, robbery, theft, knife crime, violent crime. “We used to do this, officers want it, victims want it, defence lawyers want it, and we are sure the courts do too, but the system keeps saying no. We are trying to help free up CPS and partner agency work to do what they should be doing – prosecuting, not administration.” The causes of big backlogs in the justice system include cuts made by the government as part of austerity, with that then exacerbated by the turmoil caused by Covid and subsequent lockdowns. Police in England and Wales report that their charging rates of suspects plummet in recent years. The three senior chief constables say: “Where is the evidence to support our call? In March 2015, 16% of crimes were resolved with a charge and/or summons and now it is 5.6%.. “This is not because police have suddenly become less effective. It is because of so called ‘attrition’ where victim disengagement occurs and results in fewer charges due to time delays and a feeling of being unsupported by a seemingly faceless and insensitive system.” Watson, reputed to be one of the favourite police chiefs of the home secretary, Suella Braverman, told the Guardian that long waits led to the lifeblood of the justice system – victims and witnesses willing to testify and support prosecutions – giving up. “We lose victims and witnesses in the process. Nothing reassures victims and witnesses like a charge – it’s validation. Delays lead to victims and witnesses losing faith in the system,” he said. The claim by the three senior chief constables – that the crisis is worsening – is embarrassing for the Conservatives – who made the cuts in the first place, and for the government also as it claims to be fixing the problem. The police chiefs say: “The CPS like many other public bodies, including the police and courts, had to change through austerity, we all get that and it led to a commensurate reduction in capacity. Yet we appear to be trying to do the same things, despite some elements of the system being broken through no fault of any agency.” The call will be seen by some critics as self-serving. Policing is under fire for scandals involving its own officers’ wrongdoing and for a perceived decline in effective crime-fighting. Jo Sidhu KC, a barrister and former chair of the criminal bar association, said the police chiefs’ plan was no substitute for proper funding and risked merely shifting the problem. He said: “Simply giving the police more responsibility for charging suspects will do little to reduce the unprecedented delays and huge backlog that have accumulated over recent years and which are now baked into the criminal justice system as a result of a deliberate government policy of neglect and disinvestment. “If a wrong decision to charge is made by the police then it is the CPS who will have to step in to reverse it, causing unnecessary additional delays and further distress to complainants. If the police wrongly fail to charge a suspect then this can also cause real injustice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T22:36:51Z","webTitle":"£1m paid to Octopus Energy customers as part of power saving scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/25/1m-paid-to-octopus-energy-customers-as-part-of-power-saving-scheme","fields":{"bodyText":"More than £1m was paid to energy customers with Octopus Energy on Tuesday as part of a power saving scheme. The energy supplier said more than 400,000 customers took part by reducing their electricity use between 4.30pm and 6pm. National Grid’s Demand Flexibility Scheme kicked in for the first time on Monday amid cold temperatures, meaning more energy was being used while less energy was being generated by wind power. There was also uncertainty over how much power Britain could import through undersea cables from Europe. Coal-fired power stations in North Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire were put on standby in case supplies ran low, but were later stood down. It had been feared that the mixture of weather conditions, demand and generation issues could lead to blackouts. Octopus, British Gas, EDF and E.ON are all taking part in the scheme. It is only available to households with smart meters. The average customer was paid £2.50 in points for reducing their usage by an average of 60%. The top 5% were paid £15 in points. The Octopus deal can see the points turned into cash, “prizes” or donated to a fund for customers in need. More energy was saved on Tuesday, when the payment was larger, than on Monday, the firm revealed. Less than £1m was paid out on Monday. Energy firms had advised that customers could delay cooking their evening meal, or putting loads of washing on – as cookers and washing machines can use lots of electricity. The total amount of energy saved was about 250MWh (megawatt hours) nationwide, the same as the city of Liverpool going off grid for an hour, PA Media said. After being in action for two days, the scheme was not triggered for Wednesday. There had been trials before it was used properly for the first time this week. It will be in place until March 2023, the National Grid has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/live/2023/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-air-defences-shoot-down-drones-targeting-moscow-and-sevastopol-russian-officials-say","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T17:37:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: two killed in shelling of Russian village; drones targeting Moscow and Sevastopol shot down – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-air-defences-shoot-down-drones-targeting-moscow-and-sevastopol-russian-officials-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/aug/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-air-defences-shoot-down-drones-targeting-moscow-and-sevastopol-russian-officials-say","fields":{"bodyText":"This blog is now closing. Below is a roundup of today’s stories: Ukrainian forces have recaptured the heights over Bakhmut and are successfully encircling Russian troops in the city, the deputy defence minister in Kyiv has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Hanna Maliar said Russian soldiers could no longer move around Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region and progress was being made in outflanking enemy forces after months of deadly battle. Two people have been killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian village of Chausy in the Bryansk region, the region’s governor has claimed. Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram: “Currently, two civilians have died from the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.” Bryansk borders Ukraine to the north-east. Russia’s defence ministry said early on Thursday it had downed 11 Ukrainian drones near Crimea overnight, as well as two drones flying toward the capital Moscow. It said two Ukrainian drones were shot down near the city of Sevastopol on the Crimean coast, and “another 9 were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed in the Black Sea”. The ministry said there were no reports of damage or casualties in any of the affected areas. Ukraine claims to have shot down seven of ten “Shahed” drones launched at it overnight by Russia. Air defence was said to be active in Kyiv region and Khmelnytskyi. Six residents of Bilozerka in the Kherson region have been hopitalised after Russian artilerry fire hit people receiving humanitarian aid, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. Three people are now known to have died after a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia late on Wednesday. Two young women and a man were killed and nine other people were wounded, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. Zaporizhzhia city council secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said a church had been destroyed and about 15 high-rise buildings had been damaged. The authorities received requests from residents of at least 400 apartments to repair smashed windows and damaged balconies. Russian drones destroyed a fuel depot in Ukraine’s western Rivne region on Thursday, governor Vitaly Koval wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant again lost connection to its last remaining main external power line overnight and was switched to a reserve line, state-owned power generating company Energoatom said on Thursday. Additionally, the station’s Russian-installed administration said the Number 4 reactor had been moved from a “hot” to a “cold” shutdown because of signs of a steam leak. The co-founder of Russian internet giant Yandex, Arkady Volozh, condemned what he described as Russia’s “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine, days after criticism in Russia over his apparent efforts to distance himself from the country. Volozh described himself as a “Kazakhstan-born Israeli tech entrepreneur” on a personal website, drawing some criticism in Russian media and on the Telegram messenging platform for apparently playing down his links to Russia. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is barbaric, and I am categorically against it,” Reuters reports Volozh said in a statement. “I am horrified about the fate of people in Ukraine – many of them my personal friends and relatives – whose houses are being bombed every day.” Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, the defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said on Thursday. “About 10,000 soldiers will be on the border, of which 4,000 will directly support the Border Guard and 6,000 will be in the reserve,” the minister said in an interview for public radio. “We move the army closer to the border with Belarus to scare away the aggressor so that it does not dare to attack us,” Błaszczak said. Last week Poland said Belarusian helicopters had violated its airspace and has warned of provocations. The UK Ministry of Defence has claimed Russian authorities have stepped up efforts to block citizens’ access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to bypass restrictions on the internet. It notes “VPNs are hugely popular in Russia, despite being illegal since 2017. They allow users to access objective international news sources, including about the war in Ukraine.” Reuters reports that a Zaporizhzhia city official claims Russia attacked a “civilian infrastructure object” in the city on Thursday evening. Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary, said on Telegram that a fire broke out at the site of the attack and two people were injured. He did not give more details about the incident. Our chief reporter, Daniel Boffey, has this report from Kyiv. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has vowed to help pursue army commanders credibly accused of sexual harassment through the courts after allegations of “unacceptable” behaviour were raised by a female soldier speaking to the Guardian. Hanna Maliar, a lawyer by training, called on those who claimed to have been targeted to meet her, after a whistleblower alleged that a commander in a combat unit had ordered female subordinates to have sex with him or face their husbands being sent to the front. She also said she would investigate allegations that women in the armed forces had been threatened with being sent to psychiatric units for raising allegations of sexual harassment or seeking to transfer to a combat unit, warning the accused that she would personally take any credible cases to the police. The allegations were made last week by a platoon sergeant, Nadiya Haran, 27, who told the Guardian that she felt forced to ask to be transferred from her previous unit after raising the cases with senior officers but being told to “shut up”. “I left [my brigade] because there was this person high up the food chain who would harass women and I know these women,” she had said. “Some of them are my subordinates who I’m responsible for. They were harassed by the same person who basically told them if they refuse to have sex with him, he’s sending their husbands who were also in the brigade to their deaths. I was told to shut up because he did not harass me personally.” Maliar said she would meet Haran and protect any female soldiers who came forward with testimony. Ukrainian forces have recaptured the heights over Bakhmut and are successfully encircling Russian troops in the city, a defence minister in Kyiv has said. Hanna Maliar also warned of a “nightmare” situation further north after 12,000 civilians in the Kharkiv region were ordered to evacuate. In an interview with the Guardian, Maliar said Russian soldiers could no longer move around Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region and progress was being made in outflanking enemy forces after months of deadly battle. With Ukraine on the advance on the outskirts of the city, she claimed that Russia had been seeking to draw their combat units away by attacking areas of the Kharkiv region liberated from Russian occupation last September. On Thursday, the Ukrainian authorities ordered a mandatory evacuation of thousands of civilians from 37 towns and villages in the Kupiansk district, which lies north of Bakhmut. Two people have now been killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian village of Chausy in the Bryansk region, up from one death earlier on Thursday, the region’s governor has claimed. On Telegram, Alexander Bogomaz said: “Currently, two civilians have died from the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.” The Canadian defence ministerm Bill Blair, said he had had a “productive” first conversation with the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Thursday. On Twitter, he said: “Canada has already committed over $1.5 billion in military aid to Ukraine and trained almost 40,000 Ukrainian troops. As said to Minister Reznikov, our steadfast support will continue.” Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, has met the country’s Austrian ambassador, Arad Benkö. Kostin said he “sincerely appreciates the support of Austria”. One person was killed and two were wounded in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian village of Chausy in the Bryansk region, the region’s governor claimed on Thursday. “The armed forces of Ukraine shelled the village of Chausy, Pogarsky district,” Reuters reports Alexander Bogomaz said on the Telegram messaging app. “Unfortunately, as a result of the shelling, one man died, two local residents were injured.” Bryansk borders Ukraine to the north-east. Ukrainians have been sharing on social media a clip of two young women that purports to show them singing on the streets of Zaporizhzhia just a short while before they were both killed as a result of the strike yesterday which damaged a church and killed three people. According to Ukrinform, the Matviyivka village centre for culture and leisure posted: As a result of a missile attack by Russian terrorists on Zaporizhzhia, our talented girls, Svitlana Semeykina and Khrystyna Spitsyna, were killed. Yesterday they were singing and playing together for people, and today nothing of them is left. A Russian missile mercilessly took their voice, their lives, and with it a piece of the soul of each of us. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. The co-founder of Russia’s biggest internet firm has condemned Moscow’s “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine, offering some of the strongest criticism to date by a prominent Russian business figure of the Kremlin’s military actions. Arkady Volozh, who co-founded Yandex in Russia in 1997, said: “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is barbaric, and I am categorically against it.” In the statement, published on Thursday, he said: “I am horrified about the fate of people in Ukraine – many of them my personal friends and relatives – whose houses are being bombed every day.” Yandex went public on the US Nasdaq stock exchange in 2011. Volozh stepped down as chief executive and left the board of directors after the EU included him on its list of sanctions against Russian individuals and entities in June 2022. In its statement at the time, the EU wrote that the company was “responsible for promoting state media and narratives in its search results, and deranking and removing content critical of the Kremlin, such as content related to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. Reuters reports that the US will allow administrative transactions involving Russia’s central bank, National Wealth Fund and finance ministry until 12:01am on 8 November, according to the US Department of the Treasury’s website on Thursday. The Treasury allowed the extension in an updated Russia-related general license notice posted to its website. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president of Ukraine, said he had a video conference call with US military and political leaders about the situation at the frontlines on Thursday. He said the White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and chairof the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, were in attendance. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A Brink, has commented on new anti-monopoly legislation passed in the country’s parliament on Wednesday. She said the legislation would strengthen “Ukraine’s competitiveness to help attract private sector investment for its recovery.” Ukraine’s navy has said a new temporary Black Sea “humanitarian corridor” had started working on Thursday and that the first ships were expected to use it within days, Reuters reports. Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, told Reuters that the corridor would be used by commercial ships blocked at Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and for grain and agricultural products. “Today a new temporary humanitarian corridor has started to work,” Chalyk said by phone. “The corridor will be very transparent, we will put cameras on the ships and there will be a broadcast to show that this is purely a humanitarian mission and has no military purpose,” he said. The navy said in a separate statement that the risk posed by mines in the Black Sea and the military threat from Russia remained. Our visuals team has put together an interactive guide on Bakhmut, a mid-sized Ukrainian city, and how it became a key battleground in the war Russia’s defence ministry said early on Thursday it had downed 11 Ukrainian drones near Crimea overnight, as well as two drones flying toward the capital Moscow.

Bilozerka is to the west of the city of Kherson, opposite the currently occupied left-bank of the Dnipro River. Reuters is carrying a little bit more detail about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Earlier, Ukraine’s Energoatom said that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was on the verge of a blackout as it had been switched to a reserve power line that less than half of the power capacity of the main power line. Now the station’s Russian-installed administration said the Number 4 reactor had been moved from a “hot” to a “cold” shutdown because of signs of a steam leak. One of the six reactors needs to be in “hot shutdown” to produce steam for the plant’s own needs. “Plant personnel found signs of leaks in the pipe section of steam generator No. 3,” the administration said on Telegram. “To meet the steam auxiliary needs of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the transfer of power unit No. 6 to a ‘hot shutdown’ state is being considered.” The co-founder of Russian internet giant Yandex, Arkady Volozh, on Thursday condemned what he described as Russia’s “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine, days after criticism in Russia over his apparent efforts to distance himself from the country. Volozh described himself as a “Kazakhstan-born Israeli tech entrepreneur” on a personal website, drawing some criticism in Russian media and on the Telegram messenging platform for apparently playing down his links to Russia. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is barbaric, and I am categorically against it,” Reuters reports Volozh said in a statement. “I am horrified about the fate of people in Ukraine – many of them my personal friends and relatives – whose houses are being bombed every day. “Although I moved to Israel in 2014, I have to take my share of responsibility for the country’s actions,” wrote Volozh, who holds both Russian and Israeli passports. He stepped down as CEO and left the board of directors after the EU included him on its list of sanctions against Russian entities and individuals in June 2022. Volozh called the EU’s decision “misguided”. Three people are now known to have died after a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia late on Wednesday. Two young women and a man were killed and nine other people were wounded, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. Reuters reports officials said two of the people had been killed on the spot and a woman had died overnight at a hospital. A Reuters reporter at the scene saw emergency workers lifting a body, putting it on a stretcher, and wrapping it into a black body bag. Rescuers sifted through debris and an ambulance was parked near damaged buildings. Zaporizhzhia city council secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said the church had been destroyed and about 15 high-rise buildings had been damaged. The authorities received requests from residents of at least 400 apartments to repair smashed windows and damaged balconies. Interfax in Russia reports that in a statement the company who own the Zagorsk optical and mechanical plant in Sergiev Posad said it had suffered “significant damage”, adding that “it is still difficult to make an accurate assessment of it”. Russian media reports that 12 people are considered missing as a result of an explosion. Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant again lost connection to its last remaining main external power line overnight and was switched to a reserve line, state-owned power generating company Energoatom said on Thursday. Reuters reports Energoatom said that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was on the verge of a blackout as the reserve line had less than half of the power capacity of the main power line. “Such a regime is difficult for the reactor plant, its duration is limited by the project’s design and it can result in failure of the main equipment of the energy unit,” Energoatom said on Telegram. Zaporizhizhia nuclear power plant with its six reactors has been controlled by the Russian military since the early days of Moscow’s invasion in February 2022. Both sides have repeatedly accused the other of endangering the safety of the plant, where Ukrainian staff have continued to work under the duress of the occupation. Suspilne offers this morning round-up of latest news about the war: At night, the Russian army released ten “Shahed” drones over Ukraine. The air force reported air defence managed to destroy seven. Air defence was active in Kyiv region at night. There were no hits, no casualties. Air defence forces also worked in the Khmelnytskyi region. The Russian army shelled the village of Kindrashivka in the Kharkiv region – two people were injured. Kupiansk was also hit by a guided aerial bomb, and the city council building was damaged. At night, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant lost power from the main external power transmission line. Energoatom reported it was switched to the only available backup line. Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, the defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said on Thursday. “About 10,000 soldiers will be on the border, of which 4,000 will directly support the Border Guard and 6,000 will be in the reserve,” Reuters reports the minister said in an interview for public radio. “We move the army closer to the border with Belarus to scare away the aggressor so that it does not dare to attack us,” Błaszczak said. The deputy interior minister, Maciej Wąsik, had said on Wednesday that Poland would send 2,000 additional troops to its frontier with Belarus. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that 28 explosions in the Sumy region were recorded overnight due to Russian shelling, but that no casualties have been reported.

The UK Ministry of Defence has posted its daily intelligence briefing, saying that Russian authorities have stepped up efforts to block citizens’ access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to bypass restrictions on the internet. “Reports suggest many of the most popular VPNs have become unusable in some regions of Russia,” the MoD tweeted. “VPNs are hugely popular in Russia, despite being illegal since 2017. They allow users to access objective international news sources, including about the war in Ukraine.” The update notes that in addition to restricting access, Russia has mounted a scare campaign about the dangers of VPNs. “As well as increased technical disruption, the Russian state has also launched a public information campaign, attempting to scare citizens into avoiding VPNs by claiming they put their personal data at risk,” the MoD said. By turning food into a weapon Russia has resorted to one of the oldest forms of warfare. Ancient armies burned the granaries of their foes to starve them into submission. In this case, Ukraine’s economy has been further damaged and Russian exports have fetched higher prices. But the threat of starvation is thousands of miles away in the very poorest countries, that could be pushed further towards famine by higher prices and fewer humanitarian deliveries. Ukraine provided half the wheat the World Food Programme (WFP) bought on global markets, which it shipped to people most in need in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It was good quality, cheap and quick to ship from Odesa through the Bosphorus into the Mediterranean, then through the Suez Canal to Yemen and the Horn of Africa. The WFP now has to buy grain at a higher price and transport it from ports much further away: After failing to conquer Ukraine by conventional means, Russia tried an energy war, trying to hobble the power grid and freeze the nation into submission. Now it has launched a food war. The mining of the Kakhovka dam in June threatens to turn southern Ukrainian farmland into a dustbowl. Since Moscow pulled out of an UN-brokered deal to allow Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea last month, it has announced a naval blockade of the country’s ports, and directly targeted food (destroying 220,000 tonnes of cereals awaiting export in silos) on the sea coast but also inland with attacks over the past two weeks on the Danube ports of Reni and Izmail. The global cereal price index rose 10% in late July after Russia torpedoed the Black Sea grain initiative (BSGI), blocking a route that carried 32m tonnes over a year, more than half Ukraine’s total grain exports. Some traders believe prices will have risen 20% by the end of the summer. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has appealed to Vladimir Putin to reconsider, but few involved in the grain business are optimistic that the deal can be revived: More now on the drone strikes in Russia. Until a series of attacks in recent months, Moscow had not been targeted during the conflict in Ukraine, which began more than a year ago, AFP reports. The Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, however, has been disrupted by several strikes throughout the hostilities, and has seen more frequent attacks in recent weeks. Russia said Saturday it had downed a drone over the ocean near Sevastopol, the base of its Black Sea fleet. In July, Ukrainian drone strikes on Crimea blew up an ammunition depot and damaged the bridge across the Kerch Strait linking the peninsula to Russia’s mainland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned last month that “war” was coming to Russia, with the country’s “symbolic centres and military bases” becoming targets. Meanwhile Russian drones destroyed a fuel depot in Ukraine’s western Rivne region on Thursday, governor Vitaly Koval wrote on the Telegram messaging app. There were no casualties from the attack, he said, standing in front of the burning site in a video. Russia’s defence ministry said early on Thursday it had downed 11 Ukrainian drones near Crimea overnight, as well as two drones flying toward the capital Moscow, AFP reports. “Two UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) flying in the direction of the city of Moscow were destroyed,” the ministry said in a statement on Telegram. It said two Ukrainian drones were shot down near the city of Sevastopol on the Crimean coast, and “another 9 were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed in the Black Sea”. The ministry said there were no reports of damage or casualties in any of the affected areas. The strikes come a day after Russia said two Ukrainian combat drones headed for Moscow were shot down, and constitute at least the fourth attack near the capital within a week. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Russian air defences shot down two drones targeting Moscow in the early hours of Thursday morning, the city’s mayor has said. In the latest attack on the Russian capital, a drone was shot down in the Kaluga region south-west of Moscow and a second was shot down on Moscow’s central ring road, Sergei Sobyanin posted on Telegram. Meanwhile, Russian forces also downed 11 drones near Sevastopol, the city in Crimea which serves as Russia’s Black Sea navy base, the RIA news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying. Russia usually blames such attacks on Ukraine, which usually refrains from commenting. However, drone strikes targeting Moscow and Russian occupied Crimea have recently increased in frequency and last month Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that “the war is returning to the territory of Russia”. In other developments: An explosion on the grounds of a factory north of Moscow that previously made optical equipment for the Russian military killed one person, wounded 60 others and left at least eight people unaccounted for, officials said. No official explanation was given for the explosion in the city of Sergiev Posad, which produced a tall plume of black smoke and added to jitters over recent night-time drone attacks on Moscow. Ukrainian forces have made an attempt to cross the Dnipro river dividing liberated and occupied Kherson potentially breaching what has for months served as the frontline in the south of Ukraine. Russian military bloggers reported that up to seven boats, each carrying around six to seven people, landed near the settlement of Kozachi Laheri, east of Kherson city, and broke through Russian defensive lines. Two people were killed and seven injured in an apparent missile attack by Russia on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian officials said Russia targeted a residential area and a video posted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy showed smoke billowing from burning and badly damaged buildings next to a church. Thirty secondhand Leopard I battle tanks are to be refurbished by the arms manufacturer Rheinmetall at the orders of the German government and exported to Ukraine, a spokesperson for the company has confirmed. The tanks are part of a fleet of 49 vehicles that the Düsseldorf-based company bought from the Belgian private defence company OIP Land Systems. Germany and Ukraine have also agreed on the supply of two additional Patriot air defence missile systems to Kyiv, Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. “This will definitely bring us closer to creating a full-fledged air shield for Ukraine. This will help people, cities, villages,” Zelenskiy said. German prosecutors meanwhile arrested an officer from the military procurement agency on suspicion of passing secret information to Russian intelligence, the federal prosecutor’s office said. Germany, one of the largest providers of military hardware to Ukraine, is a major target of Russian spying operations, which have grown in scale since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, authorities have warned. The US and Canada imposed new sanctions on Belarus over its human rights abuses and support for the war in Ukraine. The new US measures include action against the state carrier Belavia and target a tobacco mogul close to president Alexander Lukashenko as well as 101 officials accused of subverting democracy. Two Ukrainian combat drones headed for Moscow were shot down, Russian officials said on Wednesday, the latest attack targeting the capital. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram, “Two combat drones’ attempt to fly into the city was recorded. Both were shot down by air defence”. One person was killed by Ukrainian shelling in the border village of Gorkovsky, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region on Ukraine’s northeastern border, said. Belgorod has suffered frequent artillery and drone attacks in the last few months, and in May saw an armed cross-border incursion by a raiding party purportedly consisting of Russian nationals. Moscow accused Poland and Finland of threatening its security on Wednesday and vowed a response to multiplying “threats” on Russia’s western frontier from Nato members. “Threats to the military security of the Russian Federation have multiplied in the western and northwestern strategic directions,” defence minister Sergei Shoigu said at a meeting with military officials. Those risks “require a timely and adequate response,” he added. Warsaw earlier announced it would send an additional 2,000 troops to its eastern border to join the 2,000 soldiers already stationed there, as it strengthens its border with Belarus after it became a new base for the Russian Wagner mercenary group. Last week Poland said Belarusian helicopters had violated its airspace and has warned of provocations from Belarus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T17:14:03Z","webTitle":"US reportedly held talks with Russia on nuclear risk in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/us-talks-russia-on-nuclear-war-risk-in-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has reportedly held talks with aides to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, with the aim of reducing the risk that the war in Ukraine could spill over or escalate into a nuclear conflict. The Wall Street Journal said the senior White House figure had held confidential conversations in recent months with the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and Russian security council secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan’s counterpart, that were not made public. Neither Washington or Moscow has confirmed if the talks took place and the report did not detail the time or dates of the phone calls. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the report at his daily briefing. “Once again I repeat that there are some truthful reports, but for the most part there are reports that are pure speculation,” he told reporters. In September, Russia started ratcheting up the idea that it may use nuclear weapons as it set the stage for the illegal annexation of parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, saying Ukrainian attacks on them would be considered a threat to Russia’s national security, which would be defended against using all available means. Sullivan warned that month that any use of nuclear weapons by the Kremlin would have “catastrophic consequences for Russia”, which the US had “spelled out” in private conversations with Russian officials, he told NBC. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington DC-based thinktank, noted last week that Russia had notably softened its nuclear rhetoric since early November. Russia’s foreign ministry issued a statement on 2 November about “the inadmissibility of a nuclear war in which there can be no winners” and said it was committed to reducing nuclear weapons. Putin went so far as to claim Russia had never discussed the possibility of using nuclear weapons. Shortly before what the west called sham referendums in parts of Ukraine Russia had said it intended to annex, Putin claimed without evidence that the west had threaten to use nuclear weapons against Russia. “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we, of course, will use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people,” said Putin. “This is not a bluff. And those who try to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the weathervane can turn and point towards them.” More recently, Russia had made claims, without providing evidence, that Kyiv was preparing to use a radioactive dirty bomb. Ukraine said it feared that Russia was preparing a false-flag nuclear attack, which it would then blame on Kyiv. Throughout the war, the US has had the tricky task of supporting Ukraine to defend itself against Russia, while maintaining some distance to avoid giving cause for escalation. For this reason, the US and other key western allies of Ukraine, such as the UK, have ruled out putting boots on the ground or establishing a no-fly zone that could put Nato and Russian forces into direct conflict. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in late October that it was important to keep channels of communication open with Russia to “manage escalation”, specifying his main concern was Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, but did not say if or how often such channels were being used. “We’re going to continue to communicate that any type of use of a weapon of that sort, or even the talk of the use of a weapon of that sort, is dangerous and irresponsible,” said Austin. Though nuclear tensions appear to have subsided for now, the ISW said Russia may return to nuclear brinkmanship again to prompt the west to pressure Ukraine into negotiating. Russia is trying to regain the advantage in Ukraine after a series of retreats in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. So far, its strategy, it seems, is to disable Ukraine in the rear by cutting off its power supplies over winter, while using its newly mobilised troops to gain and regain ground on the frontlines. Ukraine’s western allies reportedly envisage negotiations beginning after Ukraine has retaken the Kherson region, so that Kyiv will start from a point of strength, Italy’s La Republicca reported on Monday. On Saturday, the Washington Post said that the US was urging Kyiv to be more open to talks amid worries from allies in parts of Europe, Africa and Latin America of a protracted war with devastating economic effects. A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president said on Monday that Kyiv had never refused to negotiate with Moscow, but restated it would not hold talks while Vladimir Putin was in power. “Ukraine has never refused to negotiate. Our negotiating position is known and open,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter, saying that Russia should first withdraw its troops from Ukraine. “Is Putin ready? Obviously not. Therefore, we are constructive in our assessment: we will talk with the next leader.” On Monday, Peskov said Russia was open to talks but it was Ukraine that was refusing. Both Ukraine and the US, its main western ally, say Russia has yet to show it is serious about negotiations, pointing to Russia’s recent mobilisation drive, rerouting of its economy for the war effort, the illegal annexation of more Ukrainian territory and the accompanying nuclear rhetoric. In his nightly address on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was vital to oblige Russia to participate in “genuine” peace talks, describing the country as a destabilising force on a range of issues, including climate change. He decried “Russia’s destabilising influence” as the world confronted war, energy and food crises, and what he called the destruction of customary international relations. The climate agenda, he said, was “really suffering” but could not be “put on hold”. “So anyone serious about the climate agenda must also be serious about the need to immediately stop Russian aggression, restore our territorial integrity, and force Russia into genuine peace negotiations,” Zelenskiy said. Despite its struggle to make headway on the battlefield, Russia has had significant success in striking Ukraine’s energy sector thanks to Iranian-supplied drones, which are reportedly making up for its rapidly depleting stockpiles of missiles and rockets. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has told residents to prepare for longer cuts and make arrangements to leave the city in the event of a total blackout. Obtaining additional air defence systems and ammunition has become Kyiv’s number one priority in recent weeks. Last week, Germany sent an Iris-T system and on Monday, Ukraine’s minister of defence, Oleksiy Reznikov, welcomed Nasams and Aspide air defence systems, thanking Norway, Spain and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
