The decision comes more than two years after the government approved the release of the water, which will be treated to remove most radioactive materials but will still contain tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials insist the “treated” water will not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment, but the plans face opposition from fishermen who say it risks destroying their livelihoods, almost 12 years after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier. The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned – a process expected to take 30 to 40 years. Japan’s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted. The plan’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology – known as Alps – can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had “grave concerns” about the proposed release. Writing in the Guardian, the forum’s secretary general, Henry Puna, said Japan “should hold off on any such release until we are certain about the implications of this proposal on the environment and on human health, especially recognising that the majority of our Pacific peoples are coastal peoples, and that the ocean continues to be an integral part of their subsistence living”. The South Korean government, which has yet to lift its ban on Fukushima seafood, has said that releasing the water would pose a “grave threat” to marine life. Fishing unions in the area oppose the release, warning it would cause alarm among consumers and derail more than a decade of efforts to reassure the public that Fukushima seafood is safe to eat. Under the plan approved by Japan’s cabinet on Friday, fishermen who fear that the release will impact their livelihoods will be able to access a new ¥50bn ($385m) fund, the Kyodo news agency said. “We would like to thoroughly explain these measures to fishing communities and other relevant parties while listening to their concerns,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said at the meeting, according to Kyodo. The liquid, which Japanese officials claim is “treated” rather than “contaminated”, comprises water used to cool the damaged reactors, and rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Kyodo said the IAEA had conducted several safety reviews of the plan and would issue a report based on its findings, as well as providing support before, during and after the discharge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-22T06:37:14Z","webTitle":"Missing Titan sub likely intact but out of power, says expert who designed deepest-diving submersible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","fields":{"bodyText":"The missing Titan submersible is unlikely to have suffered a catastrophic failure of its pressure hull, according to a deep-sea engineer who designed the vessel that film-maker James Cameron used to reach Earth’s deepest point. Ron Allum, an Australian deep-sea engineer and explorer, co-designed the Deepsea Challenger submersible that Cameron used in 2012 to reach the deepest-known point of Earth’s seabed in the Mariana Trench. Allum also worked with Cameron on his Last Mysteries of the Titanic documentary in 2005. “Sound travels particularly well underwater,” Allum said. “A catastrophic implosion could be heard for thousands of miles and could be recorded.” An implosion would likely trigger signals in military hydrophones, devices used for recording or listening to underwater sounds. “To me, it sounds like the sub’s pressure hull is intact, but it’s demobilised from power,” Allum said. In such an event, the Titan was likely to have automatically dropped weights to resurface. The tourist sub lost communications in the north Atlantic on Sunday while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. How long it would take to retrieve it if found depends on where and what state the vessel is in. “If the pressure hull is flooded, you’re now talking about the dry mass of a vessel. You could be lifting a very heavy weight,” Allum said. “If it were intact, an ROV [remotely operated vehicle] could attach to it and it could at least bring it up to shallower water where they could get a stronger lift cable to it to lift it out of the water … that ascent may take an hour or two. “The ROV may have to work around the wreckage … it may take a few hours to release the sub from the seafloor.” The submersible should have released its drop weights in an emergency but partial flooding of the pressure hull could be preventing the vessel from resurfacing, Allum said. “If you have water in the pressure hull, it’s quite a large volume. The drop weights usually aren’t that big, and that could be what’s keeping it on the bottom. “It also means that if the occupants are sitting in a half-flooded pressure hull, that could also be catastrophic. They could become hypothermic. I don’t know how well the CO2 scrubber systems would work if they’re wet.” Dr Glenn Singleman, an Australian extreme medicine expert who has visited the Titanic shipwreck, said a lack of oxygen and carbon dioxide buildup were worrying concerns for the people onboard the missing submersible. “You’ve got to control your oxygen flow and you’ve got to remove carbon dioxide and you’ve got to remove water vapour. They’re the three things about the environment internally that you’ve got to control. The fourth thing is temperature … the water temperature down there is 0 to 1C,” he said. Singleman has been the expedition physician on several deep-sea exploration projects, including for Cameron’s Titanic documentary, the Deepsea Challenger expedition, and Victor Vescovo’s Five Deeps expedition. To prevent carbon dioxide buildup, submersibles are equipped with “scrubbers”, usually made of soda lime, which remove CO2 from the air. “The problem is that you get to a saturation point after a while, and you’ve got to change out the soda lime,” Singleman said. “CO2 content in air is about 400 parts per million. As it goes up, over 1,000[ppm], most people start to get symptomatic, and over 5,000, you’re very symptomatic – you get hyperventilation, you get a headache, you just feel awful.” Singleman added that the oxygen being supplied inside the vessel was likely being delivered to maintain the regular atmospheric concentration of 21% oxygen. A drop in oxygen levels in the air can result in hypoxia, in which bodily tissues become deprived of adequate supply. Oxygen concentrations of 10% and lower can result in loss of consciousness and death. Singleman said the Titan’s initial 96-hour supply of oxygen would be a figure based on an average person’s oxygen consumption at an average metabolic rate. “You’ve got no idea how people respond to the stress of a difficult situation – some people can increase their metabolic rate with stress, some people can relax and try to sleep and decrease it.” Singleman described Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five people on board, as a “legend” in the submersible community and “one of the leading experts” on the Titanic wreck. “His passion is the Titanic, and he’s visited that wreck more than 100 times in submersibles … Everybody says: why would you go on such a risky venture? The reason is because it’s his passion. This is who he is. He’s spent a lifetime in submersibles going to these extreme environments, exploring unknown places and bringing back these incredible photographs and incredible stories of what’s possible. “I’ve talked to PH many times about it. That’s worth the risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2023/jun/09/donald-trump-republicans-rally-ex-us-president-indictment-2024-race-politics-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-10T00:02:16Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump kept boxes with US nuclear program documents and foreign weapons details, indictment says – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/09/donald-trump-republicans-rally-ex-us-president-indictment-2024-race-politics-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/09/donald-trump-republicans-rally-ex-us-president-indictment-2024-race-politics-live-updates","fields":{"bodyText":"Thank you for reading along as we learn the latest on the criminal charges being brought against Donald Trump. As always, you can find more of our coverage and analysis here. Here’s a quick recap of today’s developments: Former US president Donald Trump faces 37 counts in connection with keeping hundreds of classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon. The National Archives issued a rare statement to respond to misleading statements made by Trump’s legal team. Detailing aspects of the Presidential Records Act, the Archives made it clear that “there is no history, practice, or provision in law for presidents to take official records with them when they leave office.” Trump twice disclosed national security information in separate incidents in 2021 and took steps to retain classified documents that he knew he could not keep because they had been subpoenaed by the justice department, the indictment reads. The former president also hoarded materials of the highest sensitivity after he left the White House, including documents on US nuclear programmes, potential military vulnerabilities of the US and allies, and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, it says. Special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Mar-a-Lago documents case, said in a brief remarks Friday that his office intended to seek “a speedy trial” against Trump, adding that was “consistent with the public interest”. However, Smith did not say exactly when a trial may be possible. The indictment also named Trump’s former valet, Walt Nauta, as a co-defendant, alleging that he entered into a conspiracy with Trump to obstruct justice, withheld documents or records, corruptly concealed documents in a federal investigation, engaged in a scheme to conceal and made false statements. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm ET. Posting on Truth Social, Trump announced he would be represented by defence lawyer Todd Blanche, while his attorneys Jim Trusty and John Rowley released a statement to say that they had quit working for him. A federal judge appointed by Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. Have a good evening! As we noted earlier, the federal judge initially put in place to oversee this criminal case against Trump was appointed by him and has acted favorably to him in the past. Aileen Cannon, a former prosecutor who ruled in Trump’s favor last year during the investigation – temporarily stalling the FBI’s probe – could significantly shape the outcome. As the Washington Post reports, Cannon could be the decider on whether Trump goes to trial before next November’s election, what evidence can be heard, and what counts or motions are included. Nominated by Trump in 2020, she was confirmed with help from Democrats (12 Democratic Senators voted in her favor to be exact) and has been on the bench for less than two years. The Post notes that she joined the conservative Federalist Society in law school, commenting that she agreed with “the limited role of the judiciary to say what the law is — not to make the law,” during her confirmation hearing. As promised by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican representatives are rising to Trump’s defense by attempting to poke holes in the Justice Department investigation. In a letter issued to Attorney General Merrick Garland today, Congressman and Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan raised questions around the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago that led to the discovery of classified materials Trump had previously claimed he no longer possessed. “The indictment creates, at the minimum, a serious appearance of a double standard and a miscarriage of justice,” he says in the letter, adding that “additional information recently obtained by the Committee about the Department’s execution of a search warrant on President Trump’s residence only reinforces our grave concerns that your reported actions are nothing more than a politically motivated prosecution.” As the New York Times reports, Jordan relied on “selective excerpts from an interview” with a former top FBI official, Steven D’Antuono, who raised concerns about the search warrant. Highlighting only the parts of the interview Jordan believed would help his case, he left out details shared by D’Antuono that Democrats said at the time did not cast Trump in a positive light. D’Antuono also told the panel that Trump was present when his lawyer turned over a letter to investigators misleading them that all classified documents were returned, signifying his direct involvement what might be an act of obstruction. Here’s more from the Times: But Mr. Jordan omitted several facts from his letter in an apparent effort to place Mr. D’Antuono’s account in the worst possible light. Mr. D’Antuono has told associates that he was not opposed to executing the search warrant, but wanted to give Mr. Trump’s legal team one last chance to hand over the documents before sending agents into his club — a position that his superiors overruled. Prosecutors believed that Mr. Trump’s lawyers had already misled them once, falsely certifying to the F.B.I. and the Justice Department that they had searched for documents at the club and turned over everything they could find. The 37-count indictment against Mr. Trump and one of his aides released on Friday laid out in detail the actions the former president took to deceive prosecutors and cause the lawyers to make the false certification.” Good afternoon readers! Gabrielle Canon here, taking over on the west coast. The National Archives has released a statement with a “Frequently Asked Questions” section that goes into detail on expectations and the Presidential Records Act, directly countering claims made by Trump and his legal team. “The Presidential Records Act (PRA) requires the President to separate personal documents from Presidential records before [sic] leaving office,” the Archives wrote. “There is no history, practice, or provision in law for presidents to take official records with them when they leave office to sort through, such as for a two-year period as described in some reports.” Tim Parlatore, who served as part of Trump’s legal team until recently, has repeatedly said the former president was operating within his rights, telling CNN that a president “is supposed to take the next two years after they leave office to go through all these documents to figure out what’s personal and what’s presidential.” The National Archives made it clear in their statement that this is not true and also highlighted how previous presidents handled their transition out of office. When President Obama left office in 2017, NARA took physical and legal custody of the records of his administration in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. NARA made arrangements to move the roughly 30 million pages of paper Presidential records of the Obama administration to a federally acquired, modified, and secured temporary facility that NARA leased in Hoffman Estates, IL, which meets NARA’s requirements for records storage and security. NARA moved the records to Hoffman Estates because of the intention of President Obama to build a Presidential Library in the Chicago area. You can read the statement in full here. Here’s a quick recap of today’s developments: Former US president Donald Trump faces 37 counts in connection with keeping hundreds of classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon.

A federal judge appointed by Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. Donald Trump spent the morning playing golf with Florida Republican Carlos Gimenez, the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman reported earlier today. Gimenez later responded to Haberman’s tweet with a photo of him with the former president: A lawyer for the Republican congressman and serial fabulist, George Santos, has said that the co-signers on a $500,000 bail package connected to Santos’ federal indictment are members of his family. In a letter to a New York judge, attorney Joseph Murray appealed an order this week to reveal the identities of three people who guaranteed Santos’ $500,000 bond on fraud charges. Murray wrote: Defendant has essentially publicly revealed that the suretors are family members and not lobbyists, donors or others seeking to exert influence over the defendant. At his arraignment in Long Island last month, Santos, 34, pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making false statements. The New York Times sought the identification of Santos’s bail guarantors, arguing they should be identified as they had a chance to exert political influence over a congressman. Other news outlets joined the Times in its effort. In news not related to Donald Trump but involving one of his supporters, Markus Maly of Virginia received a six-year prison sentence for his role in the January 6 attack on Congress, federal prosecutors announced Friday. A grand jury had previously found Maly, 49, guilty of interfering with police during a civil disorder, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon as well as entering and remaining in a restricted building while armed, among other charges, prosecutors said. Authorities established that Maly joined a mob of Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol on the day Congress convened to certify the former president’s defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. He was convicted of spraying a chemical irritant at a line of police officers who were defending the Capitol’s lower west terrace. In addition to serving time in prison, Maly must also spend three years under supervision after his release, prosecutors said. His co-defendants Jeffrey Scott Brown and Peter Schwartz were also found guilty of roles in the case. Schwartz later received a 14-year prison sentence. And Brown was given a prison sentence of four years. Maly raised more than $16,000 in funds for his defense from an online campaign that described him as a January 6 prisoner of war, the Associated Press had reported earlier. Prosecutors sought to take that money back in the form of a fine, arguing that Maly had a public defender and did not owe any legal fees. But neither court records nor prosecutors’ announcement about Maly’s sentence mentioned a fine for him as part of his sentence. Maly is among more than 1,000 people to be charged in connection with the January 6 attack, according to prosecutors. Numerous defendants have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, the two top Democrats in the Congress, have released a joint statement calling for the indictment to “play out through the legal process, without any outside political or ideological interference”. The statement reads: No one is above the law – including Donald Trump. It goes on to say: We encourage Mr Trump’s supporters and critics alike to let this case proceed peacefully in court. The US secret service is preparing for Donald Trump’s appearance at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday, but the agency “will not seek any special accommodations outside of what would be required to ensure the former Presidents continued safety”, according to spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. A statement by Guglielmi reads: As with any site visited by a protectee, the Secret Service is in constant coordination with the necessary entities to ensure protective requirements are met, He added: We have the utmost confidence in the professionalism and commitment to security shared by our law enforcement partners in Florida. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm ET. Donald Trump took classified documents including information on nuclear weapons in the US and secret plans to attack a foreign country, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon. The former US president, alongside a military valet, now faces a sweeping 37-count felony indictment related to the mishandling of classified documents. Here are five of the most shocking revelations in the indictment, according to my colleague Maya Yang. We have a clip of the statement by Jack Smith, the US justice department special counsel who filed charges against Donald Trump. In a short address earlier today, Smith said his team would seek “a speedy trial” after the department unsealed a 37-count indictment against the former president. Donald Trump ally, Republican Arizona representative Andy Biggs responded to Trump’s indictment from the justice department by saying that “we have now reached a war phase.” Biggs, who previously spoke out against Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg over Trump’s indictment in March, went on to add: Eye for an eye. John Bolton, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, has reacted to his former boss’s indictment, calling for his immediate withdrawal as a presidential candidate. With Donald Trump being the first US president to be federally indicted, what will come next? Will he go to prison? What are other Republicans, including his presidential contenders such as Florida governor Ron DeSantis, saying? The Guardian’s David Smith reports: It is often tempting to hype every Trump drama out of proportion and then lose sight of when something genuinely monumental has happened. Thursday night’s action by the justice department was genuinely monumental. First, it raises the question: what was Trump doing with government secrets? It was reported last month that prosecutors obtained an audio recording in which Trump talks about holding on to a classified Pentagon document related to a potential attack on Iran. Second, Trump could soon join a notorious club that includes Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac of France and Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. All have been prosecuted and convicted of corruption in the past 15 years. It’s Trump’s latest stress test for American democracy: can the state hold a former president accountable and apply the rule of law? There was a near miss for Richard Nixon, who could have faced federal charges over Watergate but was pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford. The White House knows it cannot afford to put a foot wrong. Joe Biden tries to avoid commenting on Trump’s myriad legal troubles. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also kept them at arm’s length by appointing Jack Smith as special counsel. It is Smith who investigated the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, says: “I don’t think he’s an overreaching prosecutor. He’s very rigorous and vigorous and independent and that’s what you want here and that’s what’s needed. I don’t think Merrick Garland had anything to do with it except appointing him.” For the full story, click here: Here are some of the images coming out Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort where he has been accused of possessing classified documents: Rick Wilson, the founder of the political action committee consisting of moderate Republicans, responded to Donald Trump’s indictment, saying that Trump is “utterly amoral.” He went on to add, “The man for trade in this indictment is precisely who so many Republicans to this day pretended he was not.” Smith urged the public to read the full indictment against Trump “to understand the scope and the gravity of the crimes charged”. He added that laws protecting national defence information “are critical” and “must be enforced”. Smith delivered a short statement, where he described US department of justice prosecutors working on the case as working to the “highest ethical standards”. He said it was “very important” to him that “the defendants in this case, must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law”. He added: To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial in this matter, consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused. I very much look forward to presenting our case. • This post was amended on 12 June 2023. An earlier version omitted some key words when it quoted Smith as saying the defendants “must be presumed innocent guilty in a court of law”. Special counsel Jack Smith has begun his statement to reporters following the unsealing of the indictment of former President Donald Trump. Jack Smith, the special counsel who pursued criminal charges against Donald Trump, is due to speak to reporters following the unsealing of the indictment of former President Donald Trump. We will be following it live on the blog. You can also watch it here: Donald Trump has attacked the special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Mar-a-Lago documents case, in a social media post. Trump wrote: His wife is a Trump Hater, just as he is a Trump Hater—a deranged “psycho” that shouldn’t be involved in any case having to do with “Justice,” other than to look at Biden as a criminal, which he is! The indictment reads that some of the documents include some of the most sensitive US military secrets. One of the documents concerned “nuclear capabilities of a foreign country”, the indictment says. Materials came from the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies, the indictment says. It also includes photographs of Trump’s boxes on a ballroom stage, in a club bathroom and in a storage room, where some were laying on the floor. Here’s the full text of the federal indictment of Donald Trump: The indictment alleges that Trump “endeavored to obstruct the FBI and grand jury investigations and conceal his continued retention of classified documents”. It reads that the former president tried to obstruct investigations including by “suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that [he] did not have documents called for by the grand jury subpoena” and even “suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena”. President Joe Biden said he has not spoken to the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, as the justice department unsealed charges against Donald Trump. Asked by a reporter if he would speak to Garland, Biden responded: I have not spoken to him at all and I’m not going to speak to him. The indictment also says Trump directed his valet and aide, Walt Nauta, to move boxes of records to conceal them from his attorney and the FBI. Trump and Nauta both face a count of conspiracy to obstruct justice, according to the indictment. It goes on: The purpose of the conspiracy was for Trump to keep classified documents he has taken with him from the White House and to hide and conceal them from a federal grand jury. The indictment reads that Trump stored classified documents in “a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room” at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The indictment also writes that Trump described a Pentagon “plan of attack” and shared a classified map related to a military operation. The former president “showed and described a ‘plan of attack’ that Trump said was prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official” during a meeting at the Trump national golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the indictment reads. It says: Trump told the individuals that the plan was “highly confidential” and “secret”. The meeting included individuals who did not have security clearance, the indictment says. In a later meeting, Trump displayed “a classified map related to a military operation”, acknowledging he “should not be showing it to the representative and that the representative should not get too close”, the indictment reads. The indictment reads that Trump stored in his boxes “information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack, and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack”. It goes on: The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods. The indictment charging the former US president Donald Trump with mishandling classified documents has been unsealed. We’ll bring you the key lines as we have them. In the meantime, you can read the indictment here. Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating former president Donald Trump over retention of classified government records, is expected to make a statement at 3pm ET (GMT 1900). The federal indictment of Donald Trump and his associate, Walt Nauta, has been unsealed, CNN is reporting. We’ll bring you more as it comes. Joe Biden, who is at an event in North Carolina, was asked about Trump’s indictment. NBC News’s Kelly O’Donnell reports that the president replied: I have no comment at all. Here’s some more detail on the reports that federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in addition to the former president as part of the criminal investigation into Trump’s retention of national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort and obstruction of justice. Nauta, a former military valet, worked for Trump at the White House before going to work for the former president at his Florida resort. The Wall Street Journal reports that Nauta became a focus of the investigation after surveillance footage showed him moving boxes from a storage room before and after investigators issued a subpoena seeking the return of all government documents in Trump’s possession. Investigators spoke with Nauta at least twice and asked him to submit to further questioning, but he refused further questioning, the paper said. The charges against Nauta and Trump have yet to be formally announced. A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment, the Wall Street Journal reported. My colleague Hugo Lowell reported yesterday that Nauta’s lawyer has submitted court papers describing a meeting at which a top federal prosecutor brought up his application to be a judge when they tried to gain the valet’s cooperation last year. You can read the piece here: The former vice-president, Mike Pence, has again called for the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to unseal the indictment against Donald Trump immediately. Speaking at a campaign rally in New Hampshire today, Pence called on Garland to “stop hiding” and to “stand up and explain to us why this was necessary before the sun sets today”. Pence said: The American people deserve to know the basis of this unprecedented action. They deserve to know today. Once the facts and the laws are explained and revealed in full to the American people, we can all make our own judgment. Here’s a clip of Pence’s speech: Here are some images of President Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, arriving at Seymour Johnson air force base in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The pair are scheduled to make stops at a community college in Rocky Mount to discuss workforce training programmes as well as at the Fort Liberty military base to talk about new efforts to help veterans and families of those serving in the military. Hillary Clinton has also publicly responded to Donald Trump’s indictment, tweeting a meme of herself wearing a hat with “but her emails” on it, with the caption: Bringing this back in light of recent news. Get a limited-edition But Her Emails hat and support @onwardtogether groups working to strengthen our democracy. Trump repeatedly criticised his 2016 presidential election opponent for using a personal email server while she served as secretary of state under the Obama administration. Following a years-long internal investigation into Clinton’s use of private email, the state department said it had found “no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information”. The White House’s deputy press secretary, Olivia Dalton, repeatedly declined to comment on the federal indictment of Donald Trump as she faced questions from reporters today. Dalton said: We’re just not going to comment on this case and would refer you to the DOJ, which runs its criminal investigations independently. She went on to say that President Biden “is a president who respects the rule of law and has said that since day one, that’s precisely why we’re not commenting here. He believes in respecting the independence of the DOJ and protecting the integrity of their processes”. She added: That’s, again, why we’ll leave it there. Dalton was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, as Biden flew to North Carolina. The president has announced a new executive order aimed at helping military spouses and families. Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump’s valet in addition to the former president as part of the criminal investigation examining retention of national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort and obstruction of justice, according to two people familiar with the matter. The exact charges against the valet, Walt Nauta, were unclear because the indictment remains under seal. One lawyer for Nauta could not confirm the indictment and another lawyer for Nauta who is off on vacation could not immediately be reached for comment. Nauta has been under scrutiny for potential obstruction charges after he told prosecutors that Trump had instructed him to move boxes of potentially classified documents out of the Mar-a-Lago storage room after the Justice department had issued a subpoena for the return of any such papers. The lawyers for Nauta were also told last year by prosecutors that he had given them potentially conflicting testimony that could give rise to false statements charges, the people said. Prosecutors recommended that Nauta cooperate against Trump but were rebuffed. An aide to Donald Trump, Walt Nauta, has been indicted alongside the former president in special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents, according to several reports. Trump has also posted about the news on Truth Social. He said: I have just learned that the “Thugs” from the Department of Injustice will be Indicting a wonderful man, Walt Nauta, a member of the U.S. Navy, who served proudly with me in the White House, retired as Senior Chief, and then transitioned into private life as a personal aide. He has done a fantastic job! They are trying to destroy his life, like the lives of so many others, hoping that he will say bad things about “Trump.” He is strong, brave, and a Great Patriot. The FBI and DOJ are CORRUPT! Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is vying for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has responded to the news of Trump’s indictment. Posting to Twitter, Haley said: This is not how justice should be pursued in our country. The American people are exhausted by the prosecutorial overreach, double standards, and vendetta politics. It’s time to move beyond the endless drama and distractions. Jim Trusty and John Rowley, two lawyers representing Donald Trump, have issued a statement to say they have quit working for him. The joint statement reads that the pair “tendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigation”. It goes on: It has been an honor to have spent the last year defending him, and we know he will be vindicated in his battle against the Biden Administration’s partisan weaponization of the American justice system. Now that the case has been filed in Miami, this is a logical moment for us to step aside and let others carry the cases through to completion. President Joe Biden had no advance knowledge of the indictment against Trump and found out about it like everyone else, according to the White House’s spokesperson, Olivia Dalton. Here’s the full statement by Donald Trump announcing a shake-up of his legal team. Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: For purposes of fighting the Greatest Witch Hunt of all time, now moving to the Florida Courts, I will be represented by Todd Blanche, Esq., and a firm to be named later. I want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and “sick” group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days. When will Joe Biden be Indicted for his many crimes against our Nation? MAGA! Donald Trump has announced a shake-up of his legal team on his social media platform, Truth Social, my colleague Hugo Lowell reports. The US senate judiciary committee chairman, Dick Durbin, has said the investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith should be allowed to continue “without interference”. In a statement on Friday, Durbin added that Donald Trump “should be afforded the due process protections that he is guaranteed by our constitution, just like any other American”. Mike Pence has called on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to address the nation and for the federal indictment against Trump to be unsealed. Speaking in an interview with the conservative radio host, Hugh Hewitt, this morning, the former vice-president said it was “totally unacceptable” that the justice department had not yet released the indictment to the public. Pence said: I think before the sun sets today, the attorney general of the United States should be standing in front of the American people, should unseal this indictment, should provide the American people with all the facts and information here. And the American people be able to judge for themselves whether this is just the latest incident of weaponization and politicization at the justice department or it’s something different. Will the federal criminal indictment prevent Trump from election campaigning or, if he wins the 2024 race, taking office? Reuters has the answer – no and no. This becomes surreal when you project the scenario forward, but here goes some of the Reuters explainer: The indictment is under seal, but Trump’s lawyer said he is charged with seven criminal counts including violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. None of those would bar Trump from office if he is convicted. A trial would take place many months from now, and Trump can freely campaign during this time. The U.S. Constitution only requires that presidential candidates be natural-born U.S. citizens who are at least 35 years old and have lived in the country for 14 years. Trump said on Thursday on his Truth Social platform that he is innocent. He would be free to campaign even if he is convicted and sent to prison, and legal experts say there would be no basis to block his swearing-in as president even if he is incarcerated, though this would pose extraordinary logistical and security questions. It is unlikely that the prosecution would proceed if Trump won the November 2024 election. The U.S. Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, and presidents are the top federal law enforcement officers in the country. Federal prosecutors generally serve at their pleasure. The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted. The department can deviate from policy in ‘extraordinary circumstances’ with the approval of the U.S. attorney general.” This all reminds us that Trump was not charged in the Russia investigation while he was the occupant of the White House, as special counsel Robert Mueller adhered to received protocol – despite seemingly ample evidence alleging that Trump had at least obstructed justice by hampering the inquiry. Mitt Romney is one of Donald Trump’s few Republican detractors in the Senate, or anywhere in Congress, for that matter. Here’s what Romney – who was the GOP’s unsuccessful nominee for president in the 2012 election – has to say about Trump’s federal indictment: Like all Americans, Mr Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence. The government has the burden of proving its charges beyond a reasonable doubt and securing a unanimous verdict by a South Florida jury. By all appearances, the Justice Department and special counsel have exercised due care, affording Mr Trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others. Mr Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so. These allegations are serious and if proven, would be consistent with his other actions offensive to the national interest, such as withholding defensive weapons from Ukraine for political reasons and failing to defend the Capitol from violent attack and insurrection. The good and non-partisan folks at C-SPAN have unearthed a clip from 2016 in which none other than Donald Trump himself vows to take a hard line against the leaking of classified information. Wonder if he stands by these comments today: Ever since Donald Trump rode down that escalator in 2015 and began his journey to the White House, the business mogul’s enemies have been waiting for the day when the Republican party ditches him. Today is not that day. Just take a look at what speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had to say last night after news of the indictment broke: It’s a sentiment that’s being repeated among House Republicans, and the party at large. In fact, the real news will be if any Republican who has not already decides that today is the day they’ll break with Trump. We’ll let you know if that happens. A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. US district judge Aileen Cannon has been listed on the summons sent to Trump’s lawyers, the source said. You may remember the judge’s name from last year, when she granted a request from Trump’s attorneys to appoint a special master to review the records federal agents seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in August. The special master review delayed the justice department’s investigation into the materials and how they ended up at Trump’s south Florida property, but in December, Cannon’s decision was overturned by the unanimous decision of a federal appeals court. You can read more about the whole saga below: Now that Donald Trump has been indicted, what happens next? The Guardian’s Joan E Greve has the answer: Donald Trump is preparing for his second arraignment in two months after learning that he would face seven federal charges in connection to his mishandling of classified documents. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm, although the exact charges he will face are still unclear as the seven-count indictment remains under seal. On Fox News Digital on Thursday night he said he would plead not guilty. After news of the indictment broke, Trump’s allies rallied to his defense as the US braced for the unprecedented spectacle of a former president forced to defend himself against federal criminal charges. Fresh off the news that Donald Trump is being indicted on several felonies related to possessing classified government documents, CNN reports this morning that an audio recording has emerged of him bragging about keeping a “secret” military document that had not been declassified. “As president, I could have declassified, but now I can’t,” Trump says, according to a transcript of the recording that CNN obtained. The network reports that the audio recording captures the sound of paper rustling, indicating that Trump may have actually been waving the document around as he was talking about it. “Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,” Trump says in the transcript. “This was done by the military and given to me.” Prosecutors have this recording, CNN says. Here’s more from their story: Former President Donald Trump acknowledged on tape in a 2021 meeting that he had retained “secret” military information that he had not declassified, according to a transcript of the audio recording obtained by CNN. “As president, I could have declassified, but now I can’t,” Trump says, according to the transcript. CNN obtained the transcript of a portion of the meeting where Trump is discussing a classified Pentagon document about attacking Iran. In the audio recording, which CNN previously reported was obtained by prosecutors, Trump says that he did not declassify the document he’s referencing, according to the transcript. Trump was indicted Thursday on seven counts in special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. Details from the indictment have not been made public, so it unknown whether any of the seven counts refer to the recorded 2021 meeting. Still, the tape is significant because it shows that Trump had an understanding the records he had with him at Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House remained classified. Publicly, Trump has claimed that all the documents he brought with him to his Florida residence are declassified, while he’s railed against the special counsel’s investigation as a political witch hunt attempting to interfere with his 2024 presidential campaign. CNN first reported last week that prosecutors had obtained the audio recording of Trump’s 2021 meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort, with two people working on the autobiography of Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows as well as aides employed by the former president, including communications specialist Margo Martin. The transcript of the audio recording suggests that Trump is showing the document he’s discussing to those in the room. Several sources have told CNN the recording captures the sound of paper rustling, as if Trump was waving the document around, though is not clear if it was the actual Iran document. “Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,” Trump says at one point, according to the transcript. “This was done by the military and given to me.” Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is making history again, and not in a good way. Yesterday evening, he announced that he would soon be indicted on federal charges related to the classified documents discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort last year, the first time in US history a former president has faced such allegations. While the justice department has yet to confirm the charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed late last year to investigate the secret materials matter along with Trump’s involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the overall effort to prevent Joe Biden from taking office, the news has become yet another rallying cry for Republicans – even Trump’s opponents for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. Florida governor Ron DeSantis vowed to “bring accountability” to the justice department, while senator Tim Scott lamented “a justice system where the scales are weighted”. GOP politicians have generally flocked to defend Trump whenever he faces legal trouble, such as when the Manhattan district attorney separately indicted him in March, and today is no different. We’ll keep you posted on this developing story. Here’s what else is going on today: Joe Biden has a long day of travel in North Carolina, which will give the traveling press corps plenty of opportunities to ask him what he thinks of the charges against Trump. Principal deputy White House press secretary Olivia Dalton will brief reporters around 10.30am eastern time, and you can bet that she, too, will be asked about the indictment. Matt Gaetz, a prominent Trump ally in the House of Representatives, is the subject of a new investigation by the chamber’s ethics committee, Punchbowl News reports. It’s unclear what matter they are looking into, but earlier this year, Gaetz said the justice department ended a sex trafficking inquiry into him without charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-18T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"How Florida’s Republican supermajority handed Ron DeSantis unfettered power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","fields":{"bodyText":"If there’s one word Floridians have heard plenty of since their Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, was sworn in for a second term last month, it is “freedom”. The rightwing politician, expected by many to seek his party’s 2024 presidential nomination, sprinkles the word freely as he ramps up the “anti-woke” crusade he believes can propel him to the White House. It turns out, following a special legislative session last week that handed DeSantis victory after victory in his culture wars against Disney, transgender communities, students, migrants and communities of color, the person with the greatest freedom in Florida to do exactly as he pleases is the governor himself. In November, voters granted DeSantis’s wish of a veto-proof Republican supermajority in the state legislature. In a five-day session, those politicians validated every one of his demands. They granted DeSantis total control of the board governing Disney, the theme park giant with whom he feuded over his anti-LGBTQ+ “don’t say gay” law. They gave him permission to fly migrants from anywhere in the US to destinations of his choosing, for political purposes, then send the bill to Florida’s taxpayers. And they handed unprecedented prosecutorial powers to his newly created, hand-picked office of election “integrity”, pursuing supposed cases of voter fraud. The special session is over but DeSantis’s devotion to seeking retribution against those who disagree with him is not. Last week, after a backlash, the Florida High School Athletic Association backed away from forcing female students to chronicle their menstrual histories on medical forms, a requirement seen by many as a thinly-veiled attempt to keep transgender athletes out of girls’ sports. Exactly one week later, a Republican House committee proposed allowing DeSantis to turf out those who made the decision and replace them with his own appointments. It’s a familiar playbook: the Disney legislation allows the governor to supplant sitting officials on its governing tax authority with his own picks; his “hostile takeover” of the liberal New College of Florida last month was accomplished by swamping its board of trustees with hand-picked allies and conservative Christians. In what critics say was a particularly petty act earlier this month, DeSantis moved to strip the liquor license from the non-profit Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation because it hosted a drag show, which some children attended with parents. The threats keep coming. The notoriously thin-skinned DeSantis wants to cut state ties with the College Board, which criticised him for a “PR stunt and posturing” when he demanded it revise an advanced placement college course on African American studies he said “lacked educational value”. “No politician should silence the stories of Black and brown people who helped create our country. Our democracy and constitutional values must transcend such hateful and callous political agendas,” said Tiffani Lemon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Others accuse DeSantis of fascism, among them the progressive Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost, whose vocal criticism of the governor long predated his election in November. “If you disagree with Ron DeSantis he’ll abuse his power to close down your business, take over your school, remove your classes and unconstitutionally fire you,” Frost said in a tweet. “I encourage folks to look up the definition of fascism then read these headlines.” Other Florida Democrats see the DeSantis-ordered special legislative session as his “get out jail free card”, sweeping away legal obstacles and other hurdles that threatened to stall his policy objectives. His original plan to abolish the Disney authority would have saddled residents with $1bn in bond debt, so instead he asked the legislature to rename and restructure it. Judges threw out charges against several ex-felons the governor said voted illegally because his state office lacked prosecutorial authority, so a new law was drafted to give it. DeSantis’s administration was sued for flying migrants from Texas to Massachusetts in a “vile political stunt” stunt last year, because the existing law restricted migrant removals to those physically in Florida. So he changed the law. “It’s just a clear example of DeSantis changing the law because he broke the law,” said Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman who voted against the new measure to allow the governor to fly migrants anywhere. “Republicans like Ron DeSantis don’t care about the rules. If they don’t like the rules, they change them. And if they can’t change them they try to destroy them, as we saw with the [January 6] insurrection.” ••• Gregory Koger, chair of political science at the University of Miami, said the issues the legislature addressed suggested “speed over thought” when the DeSantis administration was planning its strategies. “It’s not unusual at all to see legislators and executives fixing problems in the laws that they have passed,” he said. “You could have had a slow, bipartisan, well-thought-out approach to changing the relationship between Florida and Disney, but that isn’t what we observed. We saw a law being drafted and passed as an act of retribution, and now they have to come back and say, ‘Well, when we passed our act of retribution, here’s what we actually meant.’ “Same with changing the guidelines for Florida to fly migrants. That seems like an effort to back out of a legal challenge to their behavior by retroactively saying the legislature is actually OK tricking people into getting on a plane in Texas and flying them from there, rather than finding actual undocumented people in Florida.” In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s press secretary, Bryan Griffin, defended the governor, saying he was bringing “a new era of accountability and transparency” to Disney, Florida’s biggest employer. “Businesses in Florida should operate on a level playing field,” Griffin said. “In 1967, the Florida legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which gifted extraordinary special privileges to a single corporation. “Until Governor DeSantis acted, the Walt Disney Company maintained sole control over the district. This power amounted to an unaccountable corporate kingdom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-11T08:27:12Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Matildas fever grips Australia; News Corp profits dive; and Melbourne e-scooters to ‘shout’ at rule breakers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","fields":{"bodyText":"Good Afternoon.

Nuclear fusion involves smashing together light elements such as hydrogen to form heavier elements, releasing a huge burst of energy in the process. The approach, which gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars, has been hailed as having huge potential as a sustainable, low-carbon energy source. However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition. That was, it seems, until now. According to a report in the Financial Times, which has yet to be confirmed by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that is behind the work, researchers have managed to release 2.5 MJ of energy after using just 2.1 MJ to heat the fuel with lasers. Dr Robbie Scott, of the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Central Laser Facility (CLF) Plasma Physics Group, who contributed to this research, described the results as a “momentous achievement”. “Fusion has the potential to provide a near-limitless, safe, clean, source of carbon-free baseload energy,” he said. “This seminal result from the National Ignition Facility is the first laboratory demonstration of fusion ‘energy-gain’ – where more fusion energy is output than input by the laser beams. The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated. “The experiment demonstrates unambiguously that the physics of Laser Fusion works,” he added. “In order to transform NIF’s result into power production a lot of work remains, but this is a key step along the path.” Prof Jeremy Chittenden, professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, agreed. “If what has been reported is true and more energy has been released than was used to produce the plasma, that is a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting,” he said. “It proves that the long sought-after goal, the ‘holy grail’ of fusion, can indeed be achieved.” But experts have stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is a long way from being a mainstay of the energy landscape. To start with, 0.4MJ is about 0.1kWh – about enough energy to boil a kettle. “To turn fusion into a power source we’ll need to boost the energy gain still further,” said Chittenden. “We’ll also need to find a way to reproduce the same effect much more frequently and much more cheaply before we can realistically turn this into a power plant.” Prof Justin Wark, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, added that while, in principle, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory could produce such a result about once a day, a fusion power plant would need to do it 10 times a second. And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves. However, Chittenden stressed the NIF was designed for a scientific demonstration, not as a power plant. “The efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,” he said. “Anyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor,” he added. “The experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.” The latest results, if true, top the last big breakthrough by the facility which came just last year when it was announced that the team had hit 70% of the laser energy put in to the experiment released as nuclear energy. • This article was amended on 13 December 2022 to replace a Rubicon reference, on usage grounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T21:20:09Z","webTitle":"Republicans criticize Biden’s trip to Kyiv as Putin withdraws from nuclear treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"For Joe Biden to safely visit Ukraine, the White House spirited him out of the country in the middle of the night and made reporters traveling with him swear a temporary oath of secrecy – none of which could protect the president from attacks by Republicans. The journey was only complicated further by an unexpected announcement. In a speech marking a year since he sent his armies over Ukraine’s borders in an ill-fated attempt to take Kyiv, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced his country would no longer participate in the last nuclear arms control treaty with the United States still standing, and accused the west of posing an existential threat to his country. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” Putin said, accusing Washington of striving “to build an American-style world where there is only one master”. Biden continues his travels in Poland, but conservative Republicans have scrambled to downplay the president’s decision to travel to an active foreign war zone without a significant American military presence, arguing in appearances on Fox News that Biden would have been better off visiting the border with Mexico, or the Ohio town stricken by toxic waste spilled from a derailed train. “The president’s now spent more time in Kyiv than he has at our southern border,” said Kevin Hern, a House Republican from Oklahoma who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee. Fellow House Republican David Kustoff gave Biden “kudos” for the trip but brought up the derailment earlier this month of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, a village of 4,761 residents where many are demanding answers about the spill’s health effects. “There are a lot of people here in the US that would say he probably should have gone to Ohio and visited with the people who have been afflicted by the derailment first,” Kustoff said on Fox News. On Twitter, the rightwing lawmaker and Ukraine foe Marjorie Taylor Greene said Biden “chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden.” The comments from Republicans were, in many ways, business as usual for the Biden presidency. The GOP has hammered him since practically the start of his administration for the increase in migrant arrivals on the southern border, and more recently seized on the East Palestine derailment to argue his administration is turning a blind eye to an environmental disaster. “That was the biggest slap in the face. That tells you right now he doesn’t care about us,” East Palestine’s mayor Trent Conaway said of Biden’s Ukraine trip in an appearance on Fox News. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on Tuesday it would take over the response to the 3 February derailment in the eastern Ohio town, with Biden’s EPA chief Michael Regan vowing rail operator Norfolk Southern “will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they’ve inflicted on this community”. Last month, Biden visited Texas’s border with Mexico shortly after he announced new restrictions on migrants who arrive in the United States, which drew opposition from advocacy groups and progressive Democrats. But the comments from the Republican lawmakers could also be harbingers of major political battles to come. Since Russia’s invasion, the US has supplied Kyiv with about $30bn worth of pivotal weaponry and other aid, but the country will likely need more to hold off Moscow’s troops. That will require the agreement of both the Biden administration and his Democratic allies controlling the Senate, as well as the Republicans in control of the House of Representatives. “We’re all for Ukraine, we support their effort against the Russians as we approach the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, but the message that I get from constituents all across west Tennessee and I think other members of Congress get is, we need to stop the spending,” Kustoff said. “We need to take care of people at home first before we look to take care of people across the world.” The sentiment wasn’t unanimous among Republicans. GOP senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement that he was “very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine”, and called it “the right signal to send at the right time”. He urged the Biden administration to keep pressure on Russia by designating it a state sponsor of terrorism, and to send advanced fighter jets to Ukraine. “Words are powerful, but they must be followed by powerful actions as well,” Graham said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T12:20:48Z","webTitle":"Swagger, power and all-star cameos: Foo Fighters roar back with new drummer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/22/swagger-power-and-all-star-cameos-foo-fighters-roar-back-with-new-drummer","fields":{"bodyText":"Were he not already a singer, multi-instrumentalist, writer and occasional actor, Dave Grohl could earn a living making life’s lemons into lemonade. The ex-Nirvana drummer started fronting Foo Fighters in the fallout of Kurt Cobain’s death; nearly 30 years later, they’re earnestly promoting themselves as “the last great American rock band”. A similar sense of answering immeasurable grief with tireless forward motion permeates the band’s latest return to the spotlight, a live stream to unveil their next phase. Just over a year ago, in March 2022, Taylor Hawkins, the band’s drummer of 25 years, died of a sudden cardiac arrest with drugs including opiates, antidepressants and benzodiazepines found in his body. He was 50 years old. Fans mourned a musician so skilled that he somehow made the kit his own while sharing stages with Gen X’s favourite drummer; his bandmates publicly celebrated his life by playing two stadium-sized tribute shows featuring guest appearances from everyone from Lars Ulrich to Kesha. But tonight’s live stream, titled Preparing Music for Concerts, is firmly focused on the present and future. The footage fades into view in black and white and begins with a scene of innocuous band banter: “Have you ever gotten into a fight with someone in your own band on stage?” Grohl randomly asks his four surviving cohorts. Their subsequent smiley reminiscences mark the first sign of normality in the Foos camp in more than a year. Hawkins isn’t mentioned once over the ensuing hour, which dwells instead on the question of his replacement for their forthcoming US tour, a potentially morbid question that they answer with trademark good humour. The Foos are known for this kind of lightheartedness, found in everything from the Learn to Fly video to their Carrie-parodying Ice Bucket Challenge. Today, a cavalcade of superstar drummers bust into the band’s Studio 606, only to excuse themselves. Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith? Someone’s Mercedes is blocking his car. Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee? He’s just bringing in some Chinese food. Tool’s Danny Carey? He’s only here to groom the Foos’ poodles. The punchline is that actual fill-in Josh Freese was in the same room, perched behind an offscreen drum kit, the entire time. For anyone who’s paid attention over the past year, him landing the job isn’t a stunning revelation. The chameleonic session musician – who already has Nine Inch Nails, Bruce Springsteen, Paramore, Weezer and Guns N’ Roses on his CV – played at both Hawkins memorial concerts in 2022. Last week, he left his posts in both the Offspring and Danny Elfman’s band. The writing was on the wall, no matter how star-studded the smokescreen. Similarly unsurprising is that Freese plays Foos songs as if Hawkins mentored him. Once the music starts, All My Life is just as volatile a post-hardcore explosion as it was on 2002’s One By One. The scrambling pace plays to Freese’s punk roots (as well as Grohl’s underrated throat-shredding howls) and he even gets a mid-song solo. By the time he has thrashed his way through Monkey Wrench, to the visible awe of his new bandmates, it’s clear the sheer extent to which this stream is all about him. He and Grohl frequently geek out on drumming between songs; the frontman also quizzes him on his punk band the Vandals and his days playing in a Disneyland covers act at 12 years old. The other throughline of tonight’s proceedings is that the Foos are releasing a new album next week (2 June) and it can’t promote itself. The stream’s monochrome colour scheme is doubtlessly designed to tether it to But Here We Are, with its black and white cover and music videos. Both singles, classic-sounding anthem Rescued and bittersweet yet uptempo rocker Under You, are performed, the latter especially evocative in its exploration of loss: “Think I’m getting over it / But there’s no getting over it.” They debut a new song, Nothing at All. The verses’ strummed guitar and swaggering bassline crescendo with a pop-hardcore hook. “Never mind, love and hate! / Peace of mind, it’s a bit too late!” Grohl snarls to end a lyrical breakdown of a tumultuous relationship. Together, these three songs paint a picture of a back-to-basics rock record, eschewing the prog of 2017’s Concrete and Gold and the dance flourishes of 2021’s Medicine at Midnight. It may prove an apt soundtrack to a band clearly craving a renewed sense of normality in the aftermath of tragedy. Ultimately, what Preparing Music for Concerts deals best in is reassurance: the Foos can still play powerfully and enjoy themselves with their first new drummer since 1997, while their forthcoming output seems set to resume the band’s hard-rocking ways. Dave Grohl’s lemonade stand is still doing brisk business. • But Here We Are is released via Roswell/RCA on 2 June • This article was updated on 22 May 2023 to more accurately report the drugs in Hawkins’ body when he died."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-19T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"The pet I’ll never forget: Emmeline the tiny bat taught me the power of empathy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","fields":{"bodyText":"When I was growing up, there was a woman in our Devon village called Sylvia, who was known as the Bat Lady. She didn’t live in a grotto dripping with stalactites, but in a 1960s detached four-bedroom house, with carpeting up the side of the bathtub and a serving hatch in the kitchen. She was known as the Bat Lady not because she stalked alleys in latex, but because she rescued and rehabilitated injured bats. She kept them in her cool, dark loft, in cages she crafted from green netting and planks of recycled wood. One day, when I was about nine, my mum took me over to Sylvia’s house. The bats hung there, blinking blearily through beady nocturnal eyes. Their wings were wrapped around them like leathery papooses, and they snuggled inside, like gothic babies suspended in the gloom. Entranced, I asked if I could have one. Sylvia laughed her tinkly laugh and said I could look after a bat if she ever went on holiday. True to her word, when she did go off on her travels, probably somewhere like Easter Island or Borneo – Sylvia didn’t do anything by halves – I was allowed to foster Emmeline. She was a pipistrelle, one of the world’s smallest bats, weighing in at 3g. The size of a conker. She arrived with her bespoke cage and a container writhing with live mealworms. I insisted on keeping Emmeline in my room, and was comforted during the night by the papery sound of her wings as she flitted around the cage. I was terrified at night as a child, and loved the thought of a conscious creature waking up and doing things just as I was going to sleep. She was looking out for me. Once, weighing her gently between thumb and forefinger, feeling I could crush her at any minute, I held a mealworm aloft, and a tiny tongue flicked out to taste it. Then, with surprising ferocity, she lunged forward and gulped down the whole thing. I was impressed. It would be like eating an entire Subway footlong in one bite. In that moment, Emmeline taught me empathy in the most literal and physical of ways. The fact that she was utterly reliant on me for sustenance and life hit home in one of those childhood lightbulb moments you remember for ever. It was my first experience of sole responsibility for another living thing – and my last, unless you count the cactus that sat on my desk from 2015 to 2020. It was chucked in the bin when lockdown hit. Emmeline, however, made a full recovery, and flew free. • This article was amended on 23 June 2023 to replace an earlier photograph with a more suitable image."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-17T18:12:25Z","webTitle":"Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern call for return of Stormont power sharing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/17/tony-blair-and-bertie-ahern-call-for-return-of-stormont-power-sharing","fields":{"bodyText":"Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern have made an impassioned plea to the Democratic Unionist party to revive power sharing in Northern Ireland and help end the period of political instability, saying the “people on this island need them”. The former British and Irish prime ministers told a conference in Belfast on Monday that the region’s leaders had a responsibility to break a political deadlock and safeguard peace. Speaking on a panel shared with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ahern urged the DUP to “stay the road with us” in shoring up the Good Friday agreement. The former taoiseach said Northern Ireland must overcome the DUP’s focus on a “small detail” – a reference to post-Brexit arrangements – in order to focus on major issues. Blair, in a thinly veiled reference to the DUP, implored the region’s leaders to restore the Stormont assembly and executive, which have been mothballed by a DUP boycott. “You know in your heart of hearts what the right thing to do is and you should just get on and do it,” he said. The appeals added to pressure on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s party to end a political vacuum that has destabilised Northern Ireland and overshadowed the 25th anniversary of the 1998 Good Friday agreement. It was the first day of a three-day conference on the future of Northern Ireland. Hosted by Queen’s University Belfast, it has drawn architects of the peace deal. Rishi Sunak, the European Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen and senior White House representatives are to follow on Wednesday. Invitations had also been sent to all seven living former UK prime ministers: Liz Truss; Boris Johnson; Theresa May; David Cameron; Gordon Brown; Blair; and John Major. On a visit to Belfast last week, Joe Biden offered a $6bn (£5bn) carrot of US investment if power sharing is restored but he avoided singling out the DUP. Analysts say the party is unlikely to make any move towards reviving Stormont until after local elections next month. Ahern, one of the few Irish leaders past or present with credibility among unionists, said the impasse must end. “You can’t wait around for ever. You can’t have elections to institutions a year ago and then nothing happens,” he said. Referencing the DUP, he said: “The people of Northern Ireland need them, the people on this island need them.” George Mitchell, a former US senator who chaired the peace talks 25 years ago, urged politicians to emulate the “courage and wisdom” of their predecessors. “It is not a sign of weakness to resolve your differences by democratic and peaceful means,” he said. “To the contrary, it is a sign of strength and of wisdom, and it clearly reflects the will of the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland.” Peace, he said, must not be allowed to “slip away”. Hillary Clinton, in her role as chancellor of Queen’s, chaired the talk with Ahern, Blair and her husband, the former US president. The three men paid tribute to each other as well as to John Hume, David Trimble and other Northern Ireland politicians who helped clinch the deal. Blair lauded Ahern’s ability to weather abuse. “People would come and be really rude to him,” he said. “I got offended on his behalf, but he was never really offended.” Bill Clinton paid his own compliment to the former taoiseach, joking: “Bertie had the kind of BS that I always wished I had. I wanna be Bertie when I grow up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/11/from-cranks-to-contenders-how-spains-far-right-vox-party-is-rising-toward-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-11T11:00:49Z","webTitle":"From ‘cranks’ to contenders: how Spain’s far-right Vox party is rising toward power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/from-cranks-to-contenders-how-spains-far-right-vox-party-is-rising-toward-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/11/from-cranks-to-contenders-how-spains-far-right-vox-party-is-rising-toward-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The man all but certain to be the next mayor of Rascafría, a small town in the green and mist-hugged mountains an hour north of Madrid, gives few clues about his political leanings as he lists his priorities for the coming months and years. As well as helping the hospitality and livestock sectors on which the local economy depends, Óscar Robles wants to improve the leisure and culture provision for Rascafría’s ill-served young people and to reopen a social club for its older residents that has been shuttered since before the Covid pandemic. “This campaign has been very honest, very on the ground and very calm,” says the 59-year-old print business owner. “We haven’t got into ideological arguments with anyone. it’s been all about the people here; the young people, the old people, the livestock farmers. I don’t care what colour you are; if you’re a neighbour, I’m here to help you.” The only unmistakable evidence of his party affiliation is to be found on the double-headed placards that still loom over Rascafría’s cold, rainy streets and which show his smiling face alongside that of a beaming Rocío Monasterio, Vox’s leader in the Madrid region. The pair, and their far-right party, have much to smile about in the wake of last month’s municipal and regional polls in Spain and in the run-up to July’s snap general election. Robles’s quiet, hyper-local campaign – waged in stark contrast to the strident, vituperative and sometimes openly xenophobic electoral tone in which Vox has come to specialise – looks set to deliver the party its first mayoralty in the region, if he can secure the agreement of other parties. Far more importantly, however, Vox is now poised to enter more regional governments and could even form part of the national government if, as expected, the conservative People’s party (PP) falls well short of an absolute majority on 23 July and has to rely on the party’s support to take office. The PP has so far refused to rule out any deals with Vox. Such a scenario would have been unthinkable even five years ago – as would the fact that Vox is now the third largest party in Spain’s 350-seat congress. Founded almost a decade ago by a disenchanted faction of the PP who felt the conservatives had become too soft and who wanted to see Spain’s regional governments dissolved and power returned to the centre, the party was dismissed for a long time as a bunch of nostalgic, anachronistic and unelectable cranks. Stunts such as unfurling a massive Spanish flag on the rock of Gibraltar did little to dispel that impression, nor did the tweets from the party’s then-leader in Andalucía about “psychopathic feminazis” and women who were too ugly to be gang-raped. But all that started to change six years ago when the failed push for Catalan independence pitched Spain into its worst political and territorial crisis in decades. Miguel González, an El País journalist who covers Vox and is the author of a book on the party titled Vox Inc: the Business of Spanish Patriotism, says the explosion of long-running tensions between Catalonia’s pro-independence regional government and the Spanish state awakened a long-dormant strain of nationalism. “I’d say there was an ashamed Spanish nationalism that was ashamed precisely because that nationalism had been used by Franco during the entire dictatorship,” he says. “That nationalism had pretty much only manifested itself during football matches when Spain was playing. But the whole Catalan issue was very important emotionally as well as politically. There are a lot of people who felt personally hurt over what happened in Catalonia, and that awoke that Spanish nationalism that had been latent.” Add to that the social, economic and demographic factors in play in Spain and many other European countries – ageing populations, fears about immigration, and digital and equality revolutions that have left many people feeling left behind – and the conditions for Vox were ripe. As González points out, straight lines can be drawn between the convulsions in Catalonia and the rise of Vox. Perceptions that the PP government of Mariano Rajoy had been too soft and too slow to react to the Catalan independence movement – and that the party had become too corrupt – also played a part. The Andalucían elections of December 2018, which came six months after Rajoy’s government had been kicked out of office via a Socialist-led no-confidence vote, saw Vox break through and take 12 seats in the regional parliament. Four months later – in the first of 2019’s two general elections – Vox gained a foothold in the parliament after winning 24 seats. That first election coincided with the trial of 12 Catalan regional government and civic leaders over their role in the push to secede from Spain. The November general election, in which Vox more than doubled its seat count to 52, was fought amid the unrest in Catalonia that met the jailing of nine of the 12 independence leaders. But the party’s greatest coup to date came in March last year when the PP cut a deal with Vox to govern the north-western region of Castilla y León as a coalition. The pact may have made the PP uneasy – not least because of Vox’s efforts to set an anti-abortion agenda in the region – but it gave Vox the keys to power and whetted its appetite for more. While Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, is hoping his party will be able to pressure his PP counterpart, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, into more coalition regional governments following last month’s polls, his eye is now firmly on national government. “Vox’s aim is to get into the Spanish government,” says González. “Abascal wants to be the [equivalent of Italy’s Matteo] Salvini; he wants to be deputy prime minister in a Feijóo government. Vox’s whole strategy is focused on that outcome.” One of Vox’s greatest achievements has been the normalisation of views that would, until very recently, have jarred in a country that has long prided itself on being tolerant, progressive and immune to nationalism. “Vox is an ultra-nationalist party – I think that’s the best definition,” says González. “Within Vox, you have sectors that came from the fascist Falange party and ultra-Catholic sectors that are pro-life and absolutely against abortion and gay marriage.” But on the streets of Rascafría – and in many other villages, towns and cities across Spain – its supporters tend to dwell less on its ideological extremes than on the prospect it offers them of a break from the socialist and PP duopoly that has governed Spain for the past five decades. For Romualdo and Luis, two Rascafría residents standing outside a cafe on one of the town’s main streets, the recent municipal election had been more about local services and investment than a clash of radically different political visions. “It’s all about the candidate here, not the party,” says Romualdo. For José Luis García, who has had a house in Rascafría for almost 40 years, much of Vox’s appeal lies in what it is not. “I think this town has been abandoned for the last two or three legislatures,” he says. “There’s nothing for the kids to do here. They’re out on the streets all bloody day. I’m a Vox voter and I’ll vote for them until they give me a reason not to. The country is screwed and they’re the only hope.” González refuses to be drawn on what will happen on 23 July. But he notes that while all the polls suggest that Feijóo will need Vox to govern, the polls also said the PP would need Vox to govern in Andalucía, where the conservatives ended up winning an absolute majority last year. “I wouldn’t rule out Feijóo’s rise coming at the expense of Vox,” he says. “But how far will that go? What happens if Feijóo gets an absolute majority? Then Vox would become a pretty small, irrelevant party.” For now, he adds, the only certainty is that European politics as a whole is very fluid and changeable. “When that [nationalism] wave came in Catalonia, Vox was a little boat, but if it hadn’t existed, it would never have been able to catch that wave,” says Gónzalez. “As long as Vox is around, it may be able to catch that wave, just like [Giorgia] Meloni [prime minister of Italy] caught it, or [Viktor] Orbán [prime minister of Hungary] caught it. These parties can grow a lot when there’s a crisis.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-13T13:00:18Z","webTitle":"Sunak to focus on carbon capture and mini-nuclear reactors in energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/13/sunak-focus-carbon-capture-mini-nuclear-reactors-energy-policy","fields":{"bodyText":"An energy security strategy will be launched “shortly”, Rishi Sunak has promised, with a focus on ramping up carbon capture and small modular reactors to develop homegrown energy and meet net zero commitments. Ministers have been forced to rework their plans after a ruling by the high court last July. It found that the government’s net zero strategy was unlawful due to a breach of the 2008 Climate Change Act, given the document did not outline how climate policies would meet legally binding carbon budgets. Campaigners have called for regulation to be cut for new clean energy projects in order to speed up Britain’s energy independence and for potential savings to be passed on to consumers. Sunak told reporters on his way to a trilateral meeting with the Australian and US leaders: “Shortly we will be outlining, in the energy security strategy, an approach forward.” He said it would focus on “carbon capture and storage, small modular reactors and the like”, and talked up the success of investment in research and development of energy sources such as offshore wind. “I am very confident that we will continue to have a very vibrant set of companies and jobs created in the UK as we transition to net zero, and our track record should give everyone confidence we know how to do this and get it right,” Sunak said. Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of the “pro-growth” campaign group Britain Remade, blamed Britain’s energy insecurity for “surging energy bills and unsustainable levels of borrowing”. He promoted the benefits of small modular reactors, which the World Economic Forum has identified as a new breed of power source that does not emit greenhouse gases and is less exposed to traditional dangers such as earthquakes and meltdowns. The technology is sparking a renaissance for nuclear energy, with a range of next-generation small modular reactors being developed in the US. However, Richards said they would “not be delivered at the pace needed without streamlining the regulatory approval process”, and he called for a list of prospective places, including a list of decommissioned nuclear sites, to be drawn up. “The government will not be able to cut Britain’s dependency on expensive foreign gas and reduce energy bills without reforming the planning system that holds back clean energy infrastructure such as onshore wind, the cheapest form of energy available,” Richards said. “With the vast majority of major clean energy projects being developed outside London and the south-east, boosting investing in clean energy infrastructure will deliver a significant economic boost and job creation in Britain’s former industrial heartlands across the north and Midlands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-01T01:14:35Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un vows to ‘exponentially’ increase nuclear warhead production","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/01/kim-jong-un-north-korea-exponentially-increase-nuclear-warhead-production","fields":{"bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has vowed to ramp up the production of nuclear warheads and build a more powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), while singling out South Korea as his country’s “undoubted enemy”, North Korean state media reported on Sunday. In a sign of deepening animosity towards the US, South Korea and Japan, Kim called for an “exponential increase” in the regime’s nuclear arsenal during an address at a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ party that ended on Saturday. The leader’s statement was released hours after North Korea fired a ballistic missile towards its eastern waters, starting 2023 as it had ended the previous year, when it conducted a record number of weapons tests. It also launched three ballistic missiles on Saturday, days after sending five drones across the heavily armed border that has divided the peninsula since the 1950-53 Korean war ended in a truce, but not a peace treaty. “The currently established situation calls for our country doubling down our efforts to strengthen our military power overwhelmingly to safeguard our sovereignty, safety and basic national interest to cope with the dangerous military moves by the US and other hostile forces that target us,” Kim said, according to the official KCNA news agency. Kim, who has used recent year-end party meetings to outline major policies, accused Washington and Seoul of carrying out a “plot to isolate and stifle” Pyongyang, calling it “unparalleled in human history”. South Korea, he said, had become “our undoubted enemy”, describing it as “hell-bent on an imprudent and dangerous arms buildup”. The North test-fired more than 70 ballistic missiles in 2022 following the breakdown in 2019 of nuclear diplomacy that culminated in three meetings between Kim and the then US president, Donald Trump, as well as summits with the then South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in. In November, it resumed testing ICBMs for the first time since 2017, successfully launching a Hwasong-17, a new, bigger missile potentially able to strike anywhere in the US. North Korea’s rapid weapons development enhances its deterrent capability and, according to some experts, puts it in a a stronger position to win sanctions relief and other concessions from the US in any future negotiations. In a worrying escalation, last year it approved a new law authorising the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons – a shift Kim referenced at the weekend. “Our nuclear force considers it as the first mission to deter war and safeguard peace and stability and, however, if it fails to deter, it will carry out the second mission, which will not be for defence,” he said, according to KCNA. The news agency said Kim had also ordered the development of a new type of ICBM with a swift, counterstrike capability and, adding that the country’s first military spy satellite would be put into orbit as soon as possible. The regime already possesses long-range missiles theoretically capable of striking the US mainland, but there is disagreement over whether it has fully functioning nuclear weapons. Ankit Panda, an expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the reference to a new ICBM appeared to concern a solid-propellant system, which can be launched more quickly than a liquid-fuelled ICBM. “We should expect to see larger, solid-propellant missiles tested soon,” Panda said. The South’s military detected Sunday’s launch from the Pyongyang region around 2.50am, the joint chiefs of staff said in a statement. It said the missile travelled about 400km (250 miles) before falling into the water between the Korean peninsula and Japan. The joint chiefs of staff called the launch “a grave provocation” that hurts peace and security on the Korean peninsula and around the world. It said South Korea closely monitored North Korean moves in coordination with the US and maintained a readiness to deal with any provocations. The US Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement that the launch highlighted “the destabilising impact” of North Korea’s unlawful weapons programs. It said US commitments to defend South Korea and Japan “remain ironclad”. On Saturday, North Korea fired three short-range ballistic missiles towards its eastern waters. North Korea’s state media confirmed on Sunday that the country conducted the test-firings of its super-large multiple rocket launcher to test the weapon’s capability. KCNA said three shells fired from the launcher on Saturday accurately hit an island target off its eastern coast. It said North Korea fired another shell from the launcher towards its eastern waters on Sunday. Outside experts categorise weapons fired from the launcher as ballistic missiles because of their trajectories, ranges and other characteristics. The North’s missile launch for a second straight day could be a response to South Korea’s recent rocket test, which is related to its plan to establish space-based surveillance to better monitor North Korea. On Friday, South Korea’s military said it test-launched a solid-fuel rocket, a type of a space launch vehicle it plans to use to put its first spy satellite into orbit in coming years. Animosities between the rival Koreas have deepened since early last week, when South Korea accused North Korea of flying drones across the countries’ heavily fortified border for the first time in five years and sent its own drones towards the North. South Korea acknowledged it failed to shoot down any of the North Korean drones it said were found south of the border. But South Korea has vowed to bolster its air defence network and get tough on future provocations by North Korea.

I can save his committee a lot of time. The money should go to Peter Wohlleben, the German forester whose book The Hidden Life of Trees was the most improbable and encouraging blockbuster of 2015. Wohlleben’s idea is this: leave forests alone. Stop fiddling with them, thinking that we can deal with climate change better than nature. If we fiddle, our Romes will burn. The Hidden Life argued that trees are social and sensate. The Power of Trees shows that they can be our saviours. But it’s terribly hard to let ourselves be saved. We think we can be the authors of our salvation. We are doers by constitution. Of course, there are things we could and should be doing, but in terms of forestry practice, often what’s billed as part of the solution is part of the problem. Anyone who has planted a tree in their garden knows that it has a profound effect – it makes your garden cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Forests do that on a grand scale. A deciduous forest in summer is often as cool as a lake. Berlin is 15C warmer than the ancient forests nearby. The coniferous monocultures so beloved of commercial foresters are not such good coolers: they’re up to 8C warmer than their deciduous counterparts. Forests cool by transpiring. If there’s no water, there’s no cooling. Drought can kill trees fast, but trees have many sophisticated ways of dealing with it, and Wohlleben sets them out. As a species, we have survived many climatic changes by changing our behaviour – and that’s how trees survive, too. Crucially, trees learn from their past traumas and produce offspring programmed with those lessons. Trees that have narrowly escaped drought are more prudent in the future: they slow their growth and ration their drinking. They have two main methods for influencing their children: the first is good parenting. Mother trees regulate their children’s growth by changing the rate at which they drip-feed them with sugar solution through root networks, and children growing in the rain and light shadow of the mother won’t drink heavily or overeat. The second is epigenetic inheritance, which enables useful behavioural traits to be passed on fast to future generations. Deciduous forests in particular remove greenhouse gases effectively, and sequester carbon for as long as they live. The rate of carbon capture increases until they’re around 450 years old. Cut them down and burn them and you’re releasing carbon dioxide not just from the wood, but also from the forest floor – as the soil, previously cool in the shade, warms and therefore accelerates the metabolism of microorganisms, which consume the remaining humus. The way of the woods is not the way of the market, and if we see forests as warehouses we are doomed. Foresters must be more than stockholders, shelf stackers, shippers and restockers. We need a radically new ethos. Deciduous trees are not “harvest-ready” at 200 years: they are teenagers. Tree planting isn’t necessarily good: the collateral costs may be extortionate. We must interrogate comforting expressions such as “renewable energy”, and learn the real cost of our toilet paper. If we don’t learn to leave the trees alone, the trees will eventually be alone anyway – but without us. Wohlleben brilliantly and readably shows us how urgent and how hard it is to do nothing. • Charles Foster’s next book, Cry of the Wild, is published in May by Doubleday.

That this narrative is self-serving is obvious, as is its implied message: that they should be allowed to get on with their habits of “creative destruction” (to use Joseph Schumpeter’s famous phrase) without being troubled by regulation. Accordingly, any government that flirts with the idea of reining in corporate power should remember that it would then be standing in the way of “progress”: for it is technology that drives history and anything that obstructs it is doomed to be roadkill. One of the many useful things about this formidable (560-page) tome is its demolition of the tech narrative’s comforting equation of technology with “progress”. Of course the fact that our lives are infinitely richer and more comfortable than those of the feudal serfs we would have been in the middle ages owes much to technological advances. Even the poor in western societies enjoy much higher living standards today than three centuries ago, and live healthier, longer lives. But a study of the past 1,000 years of human development, Acemoglu and Johnson argue, shows that “the broad-based prosperity of the past was not the result of any automatic, guaranteed gains of technological progress… Most people around the globe today are better off than our ancestors because citizens and workers in earlier industrial societies organised, challenged elite-dominated choices about technology and work conditions, and forced ways of sharing the gains from technical improvements more equitably.” Acemoglu and Johnson begin their Cook’s tour of the past millennium with the puzzle of how dominant narratives – like that which equates technological development with progress – get established. The key takeaway is unremarkable but critical: those who have power define the narrative. That’s how banks get to be thought of as “too big to fail”, or why questioning tech power is “luddite”. But their historical survey really gets under way with an absorbing account of the evolution of agricultural technologies from the neolithic age to the medieval and early modern eras. They find that successive developments “tended to enrich and empower small elites while generating few benefits for agricultural workers: peasants lacked political and social power, and the path of technology followed the vision of a narrow elite.” A similar moral is extracted from their reinterpretation of the Industrial Revolution. This focuses on the emergence of a newly emboldened middle class of entrepreneurs and businessmen whose vision rarely included any ideas of social inclusion and who were obsessed with the possibilities of steam-driven automation for increasing profits and reducing costs. The shock of the second world war led to a brief interruption in the inexorable trend of continuous technological development combined with increasing social exclusion and inequality. And the postwar years saw the rise of social democratic regimes focused on Keynesian economics, welfare states and shared prosperity. But all of this changed in the 1970s with the neoliberal turn and the subsequent evolution of the democracies we have today, in which enfeebled governments pay obeisance to giant corporations – more powerful and profitable than anything since the East India Company. These create astonishing wealth for a tiny elite (not to mention lavish salaries and bonuses for their executives) while the real incomes of ordinary people have remained stagnant, precarity rules and inequality returning to pre-1914 levels. Coincidentally, this book arrives at an opportune moment, when digital technology, currently surfing on a wave of irrational exuberance about ubiquitous AI, is booming, while the idea of shared prosperity has seemingly become a wistful pipe dream. So is there anything we might learn from the history so graphically recounted by Acemoglu and Johnson? Answer: yes. And it’s to be found in the closing chapter, which comes up with a useful list of critical steps that democracies must take to ensure that the proceeds of the next technological wave are more generally shared among their populations. Interestingly, some of the ideas it explores have a venerable provenance, reaching back to the progressive movement that brought the robber barons of the early 20th century to heel. There are three things that need to be done by a modern progressive movement. First, the technology-equals-progress narrative has to be challenged and exposed for what it is: a convenient myth propagated by a huge industry and its acolytes in government, the media and (occasionally) academia. The second is the need to cultivate and foster countervailing powers – which critically should include civil society organisations, activists and contemporary versions of trade unions. And finally, there is a need for progressive, technically informed policy proposals, and the fostering of thinktanks and other institutions that can supply a steady flow of ideas about how digital technology can be repurposed for human flourishing rather than exclusively for private profit. None of this is rocket science. It can be done. And it needs to be done if liberal democracies are to survive the next wave of technological evolution and the catastrophic acceleration of inequality that it will bring. So – who knows? Maybe this time we might really learn something from history.

His tenure was consequential. A Democrat, he battled for civil rights and came to oppose the Vietnam war. He believed Americans were citizens, not subjects. Chairing the intelligence select committee was his most enduring accomplishment. James Risen, a Pulitzer-winning reporter now with the Intercept, sees him as a hero. The Last Honest Man is both paean and lament. “For decades … the CIA’s operations faced only glancing scrutiny from the White House, and virtually none from Congress,” Risen writes. “True oversight would have to wait until 1975, and the arrival on the national stage of a senator from Idaho, Frank Church.” For 16 months, Church and his committee scrutinized the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency and their many abuses. Amid the cold war, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, Congress grappled with the balance between civil liberties and national security, executive prerogative and congressional authority. Political assassinations, covert operations and domestic surveillance finally received scrutiny and oversight. A plot to kill Fidel Castro, with an assist from organized crime, made headlines. So did the personal ties that bound John F Kennedy, mob boss Sam Giancana and their shared mistress, Judith Campbell Exner. Giancana was murdered before he testified. Before John Rosselli, another mobster, could make a third appearance, his decomposed body turned up in a steel fuel drum near Miami. One subheading in the Church committee’s interim report bears the title: “The Question of Whether the Assassination Operation Involving Underworld Figures Was Known About by Attorney General Kennedy or President Kennedy as Revealed by Investigations of Giancana and Rosselli”. Against this grizzly but intriguing backdrop, Risen’s book is aptly subtitled: The CIA, the FBI, the Mafia, and the Kennedys – And One Senator’s Fight to Save Democracy. The Last Honest Man is a gem, marbled with scoop, laden with interviews. In 2006, Risen won the Pulitzer prize for his coverage of George W Bush’s warrantless wiretapping program. Risen was also part of the New York Times team that snagged a Pulitzer in the aftermath of September 11. He endured a seven-year legal battle with the Bush and Obama justice departments, for refusing to name a source. Eric Holder, Barack Obama’s attorney general, backed off. But he earned Risen’s lasting ire. In 2015, Risen called the Obama administration “the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation”. Holder, he said, “has done the bidding of the intelligence community and the White House to damage press freedom in the United States”. And then came Donald Trump. Risen now describes Dick Cheney’s efforts to block Church’s committee, as chief of staff to Gerald Ford. To Cheney’s consternation, the president “refused to engage in an all-out war”. So Cheney nursed a grudge and bided his time. In 1987, Cheney and congressional Republicans issued a dissent on Iran-Contra, blaming the Church committee for the concept of “all but unlimited congressional power”. Later, as vice-president to George W Bush, Cheney zestily embraced the theory of the unitary executive, the global “war on terror” and the invasion of Iraq. The Last Honest Man also doubles as a guide to high-stakes politics. Risen captures Gary Hart and the late Walter Mondale on the record. Both Democratic presidential hopefuls – Mondale the candidate in 1984, Hart the frontrunner, briefly, in the 1988 race – after sitting on Church’s committee. The three senators were competitors and colleagues. Paths and ambitions intersected. Church entered the 1976 Democratic presidential primary late – and lost to Jimmy Carter. Carter weighed picking Church as his running mate but opted for Mondale instead. “I think he had seen me on a Sunday news talk show, talking about the Church committee, and he liked how I looked and sounded,” Mondale told Risen. It was for the best. Church never cottoned to Carter. Carter and his aides returned the favor. They “hated Church right back”. David Aaron, a Church aide and later deputy to Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s national security adviser, recalls: “I know that whenever Church’s name came up, Brzezinski would grimace.” In 1980, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush beat Carter and Mondale in a landslide. The election also cost Church his seat and the Democrats control of the Senate. Four years later, Mondale bested Hart for the Democratic nomination, only to be shellacked by Reagan-Bush again. Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon Papers whistleblower, leaves his mark on Risen’s pages too. He played a “previously undisclosed role in the Church committee’s investigation of the assassinations of foreign leaders”, Risen reports in a lengthy footnote. In an interview, Ellsberg says he “met privately” with Church in 1975, as the committee investigated assassination plots. In Risen’s telling, Ellsberg cops to handing Church “a manilla envelope containing copies of a series of top-secret cables” between the US embassy in South Vietnam and “the Kennedy White House”. The messages purportedly pertained to the “US role in the planning of the 1963 coup against South Vietnamese president [Ngô Đình] Diệm that resulted in his assassination”. The Church committee interim report referred to cable traffic between the embassy in Saigon and the White House but contained no mention of Ellsberg. In other words, assassinations and coups carry a bipartisan legacy. It wasn’t just Eisenhower and Nixon, Iran and Chile. Risen hails Church as “an American Cicero” who “offered the United States a brief glimpse of what it would be like to turn away from its imperialistic ambitions … and return to its roots as a republic”. He overstates, but not by much. Iraq and its aftermath still reverberate. But for that debacle, it is unlikely Trumpism would have attained the purchase it still possesses. Our national divide would not be as deep – or intractable. Church died in April 1984, aged just 59.

But that’s not necessarily a bad thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/17/wnba-power-lies-with-two-superteams-but-thats-not-necessarily-a-bad-thing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/may/17/wnba-power-lies-with-two-superteams-but-thats-not-necessarily-a-bad-thing","fields":{"bodyText":"Over the course of its 27 year history, the WNBA has come to be defined by dynastic superteams and fierce rivalries. It dates back to the league’s humble beginnings in the late 1990s, when the now-defunct Houston Comets won the first four WNBA finals, defeating the New York Liberty in three of them. The Minnesota Lynx were next, appearing in six finals between 2011 and 2017, winning four titles. But those teams were built in very particular ways. The Comets became the WNBA’s first dynasty because the league distributed players to each team ahead of its inaugural season and had no idea how good four-time WNBA finals MVP Cynthia Cooper would be. Whereas the Lynx were built primarily through the draft, being fortunate enough to select Maya Moore and Seimone Augustus No 1 overall, and later trading for Sylvia Fowles. The WNBA’s new superteam era is fundamentally different, because the rising tides in Las Vegas and New York were not born out of the league’s mistakes or chance in the draft, but through free agency. A new collective bargaining agreement ratified in 2020 gave players the freedom to choose their destinations for the first time in league history. It came to a head this winter when two of the greatest players of all time headed for opposite sides of the US for two of the league’s biggest markets, with Candace Parker joining the reigning champion Las Vegas Aces and Breanna Stewart going to the New York Liberty. As a result of an unprecedented level of player movement, the WNBA’s next era is going to look fundamentally different. But it could also be a whole lot better for everyone involved. “I’m a big rivalry [person],” Parker said after a recent Aces practice. “You think about the foundation of every single thing and every single person that tunes into anything: college basketball has UConn and Tennessee, right? Put it on the map … You think about the NBA with the Celtics and the Lakers and their rivalry, right? And I think in order to [succeed], you need those types of rivalries.” The Aces signed two-time MVP Parker this offseason after running away with the 2022 WNBA championship behind an MVP season from center A’ja Wilson. Parker will join a star-studded starting five of Wilson, finals MVP Chelsea Gray, MVP-finalist Kelsey Plum, and All-Star starter Jackie Young, giving them four former No 1 overall draft picks and four MVP trophies. There have been hiccups though: this week the team were docked a 2025 first-round draft pick and head coach Becky Hammon was given a two-game ban for “impermissible player benefits and Respect in the Workplace policies”. Meanwhile, after selecting star guard Sabrina Ionescu first overall in 2020 and losing in the first round of the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, the Liberty have joined the Aces as the clear betting favorites to win the 2023 WNBA championship after remaking their starting five. The Liberty traded for center Jonquel Jones before signing last year’s scoring leader and MVP runner-up, Stewart, adding two former MVPs. Courtney Vandersloot, the league’s active all-time assists leader and a former overseas teammate of Jones and Stewart, joined the picture too. The WNBA was already seeing immense growth without any high-profile superteams or rivalries, with the 2022 WNBA season being the most viewed since 2006. Meanwhile, the WNBA is in the process of making games more accessible to viewers, signing a new TV deal with Scripps to televise Friday night games this season. And women’s basketball is growing, with this year’s women’s NCAA Tournament having its highest viewership ever, with the title game between Iowa and LSU drawing 9.9 million viewers. But sports leagues are top-down structures. As much as the WNBA was growing organically, it needed a push to reach its full potential. After all, fans are often drawn by the biggest markets and best teams and go from there. In fact, it’s not a stretch to say that the rivalry between Larry Bird’s Boston Celtics and Magic Johnson’s Los Angeles Lakers saved the NBA in the 1980s. While the four-year stretch between 2015-18 when LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers and Steph Curry’s Golden State Warriors met in the NBA finals featured the highest NBA viewership of any span since Michael Jordan’s run in the late 1990s. The WNBA has all the momentum in the world right now, and its new superteam era should bring in more casual fans. “We’re trying to elevate the level,” Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello said. “We’re trying to promote our game and create those rivalries. I think that’s great for the WNBA. Hopefully more fans can come and watch us, and we’re selling it... We think we got some pretty special players, but you know Vegas got some special players [too].” “I think that’s what it was going to make us work really hard and get up in the morning,” Liberty co-owner Clara Wu Tsai added. “Is to be able to beat that team in the West.” But superteams don’t only help bring in casual fans to a league that has struggled with attendance and needs extra revenue if it is going to expand beyond 12 teams by its stated goal of 2025 – they also help elevate the standard of play. And there is no better proof of this than the fact that both Parker and Stewart are the MVP-caliber players they are today because they were inspired by past superteams. “I would say watching the Houston Comets play [inspired me] for sure,” Gray recently told the Guardian. “It was a first of its kind, and you’re always looking to see the first one to do something … we were watching it, kind of aspiring to be in that position.” “Yeah, I raised the roof for sure,” Parker added, referring to Comet’s guard Cynthia Cooper’s famous celebration. “And I definitely tried to go out and shoot like Tina Thompson. You know, shoot a runner and Euro [step] like Cynthia Cooper.” Stewart was busy winning four straight national championships at the University of Connecticut during the height of the Lynx and Los Angeles Sparks rivalry, saying: “It was intense. That’s what I think of. And especially the players on both teams, the way that they had so much talent and they were able to play well together, I think that that’s what I remember about those two … When you’re a basketball player, you want to play with other great players.” But players like Parker and Stewart never really had the opportunity to be “surrounded by greatness,” as Stewart put it, until now. By limiting the amount of times a franchise can “core” a player and lock them up from as many as four one-year periods down to just two with the new CBA, the WNBA has empowered players to make their own decisions. “I think what you’re seeing is the player empowerment era, if you want to call it that, where players are getting to choose the location of their legacy, and I think that’s really important,” Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said. Stewart is the vice president of the WNBA Players Association and has used her platform to push the league forward. “I think that as far as player movement, it’s something that the league needs,” Stewart said during Liberty media day. “And you’re gonna see it happening a lot more and that means just player movement, fan engagement is going to go from one team to another team. It’s just gonna make it more exciting, make things more spicy,” Stewart added, admitting that she used emojis on Twitter to create a buzz around her own free agency, helping the WNBA become a 12-month a year league like the NBA. “But it’s what the league needs to continue to kind of grow the way that we want it to and the way that it should.” Despite being at different stages of their careers, 37-year-old Parker and 28-year-old Stewart made their free agency moves for ostensibly the same reasons: In addition to having familial ties to the regions and wanting to play with other great players – both taking pay cuts to do so – Parker and Stewart were tired of sacrificing their own desires and well-being for the betterment of the league. It was time to prioritize themselves, and specifically their health and their bodies. In fact, Parker and Stewart both spoke about their desire to maximize the rest of their careers and to be treated well by franchises with ownership groups that have shown a willingness to go above and beyond for their players. So they each left smaller markets for the richest ownership groups and biggest markets in the league. Given the WNBA’s historically lackluster treatment of athletes, it makes sense. Parker has never had her own locker in her 15 year career. She came into the league during a time when teams had to work around NBA schedules and switch facilities constantly, and she has never had the ability to get up shots at a dedicated practice facility whenever she wanted to because it was always shared with other teams. Plus, like most WNBA players, she has also had to play overseas to supplement her salary until a recent media gig with Turner Sports has kept her in the States. And, again, we are talking about one of the greatest players of all time. “That’s just a part of the grind. That’s a part of growing it,” Parker said about her past experiences in Los Angeles and Chicago. “But at the end of the day, I think the reason why I’m here is because I feel like we deserve this at some point.” Parker joins an Aces team with a brand new, 64,000 square foot, state-of-the-art practice facility – the first of its kind in the WNBA. It’s complete with a weight room, training room, hydro tread, infrared sauna, nutrition bar, a hyperbaric chamber that Parker has already napped in, and a hot and cold tub she uses every day. The Aces are owned by Mark Davis (who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders and is worth a reported $2bn) and Tom Brady. They play at the Michelob Ultra Arena, a 12,000-seat arena on the Las Vegas Strip, where they had average crowds of 5,607 last season and will have seven nationally televised games in 2023. “I think it factored into my decision a lot,” Parker told the Guardian about ownership’s willingness to spend money and treat players right. “I think as a 37-year-old player, as a vet, taking care of my body is first and foremost. So to be able to have access to not just a locker but a facility that you can go and rehab and have the latest machines ... that can help my body be as prepared as it can be going into year 16.” Stewart still plays overseas each offseason because that is where she makes the majority of her salary. She does so despite what happened with former overseas teammate Brittney Griner, who was detained in a Russian prison for 10 months after bringing hashish oil into the country. Griner’s ordeal has forced other WNBA players to reconcile with their decisions to play overseas and to push the WNBA for a more livable salary. Considering that Stewart plays basketball year-round and returned to the United States just days before the start of Liberty training camp, her body and health were top of her mind when making a decision to leave the Seattle Storm for the Liberty this offseason. Like the Aces, the Liberty have invested in their facilities in recent years. The team’s owners, Joe and Clara Tsai, are estimated to be worth over $8bn, significantly more than any other WNBA team owners. That has allowed them to move the team to the Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn, a 17,732 capacity arena that they own and that is also home to the NBA’s Brooklyn Nets. There the Liberty have created their own modern practice facility. They have also heavily invested in their performance team in order to improve their athletes’ mental health and wellness, as well as recovery. “I think one of the most neglected areas in this league for a long time is player health,” Kolb said. “Especially when you have players going overseas, they’re coming back, we have a camp, and they’re all in various states of condition… We want to have the best performance team period. And that’s what we’re committed to doing because that’s what these players deserve.” Stewart told the Guardian that those investments were “very important” in her free agency decision. Adding: “They want to make sure that this team is getting everything that they need. And you realize that the moment that you walk in: You walk in, there’s breakfast, and then there’s treatment, and then there’s the weight room, and then there’s the court, and there’s all these people around who are trying to help you. “The WNBA should have teams that have a one-stop shop. I shouldn’t have to travel all over the place to get everything I need. And here in New York, you can get that right here. So, to be able to come in and have that is amazing because what I just touched on before is: I want to be my best and I want to be able to do everything I can to get that and that means the resources, and here we have all the resources.” What has become clear during the 2023 offseason is that the best players in the world are tired of sacrificing their bodies and well-being for the betterment of the league, and that it is the WNBA’s turn to meet them where they deserve to be met. The hope is that Parker and Stewart’s decisions will reverberate throughout the league and accelerate growth, pressuring the other 10 ownership groups to invest in similar resources so that the biggest markets don’t always have a competitive advantage, and so that the standard of the entire league is elevated. “Pressure might be a strong word. I’m sure everybody’s aware, at least on some level, of what everybody’s doing,” vice president of basketball operations and assistant general manager of the Dallas Wings, Travis Charles, said over the phone. “...I think new things like a practice facility and all of that stuff, I think will be the norm sooner than later. “I believe the majority of the teams were heading in the direction of enhanced player care regardless of whether it was forced by the CBA or not. I think just time and commitment and the new wave of owners has vowed to do things specifically here for our players that we weren’t able to before … So I think it might hasten or quicken what was already going to happen.” After all, the WNBA is still relatively young, with practice facilities, bigger arenas, expansion, and charter flights the most likely next dominoes to fall as the league continues to grow and improve. “I hope that this has inspired others to kind of step up the game because I know that’s how it is with ownership: It’s a competition,” Parker said. “So now, who’s going to be next?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/29/china-wind-solar-power-global-renewable-energy-leader","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-29T00:00:39Z","webTitle":"China on course to hit wind and solar power target five years ahead of time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/29/china-wind-solar-power-global-renewable-energy-leader","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/29/china-wind-solar-power-global-renewable-energy-leader","fields":{"bodyText":"China is shoring up its position as the world leader in renewable power and potentially outpacing its own ambitious energy targets, a report has found. China is set to double its capacity and produce 1,200 gigawatts of energy through wind and solar power by 2025, reaching its 2030 goal five years ahead of time, according to the report by Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based NGO that tracks operating utility-scale wind and solar farms as well as future projects in the country. It says that as of the first quarter of the year, China’s utility-scale solar capacity has reached 228GW, more than that of the rest of the world combined. The installations are concentrated in the country’s north and north-west provinces, such as Shanxi, Xinjiang and Hebei. In addition, the group identified solar farms under construction that could add another 379GW in prospective capacity, triple that of the US and nearly double that of Europe. China has also made huge strides in wind capacity: its combined onshore and offshore capacity now surpasses 310GW, double its 2017 level and roughly equivalent to the next top seven countries combined. With new projects in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu and along coastal areas, China is on course to add another 371GW before 2025, increasing the global wind fleet by nearly half. “This new data provides unrivalled granularity about China’s jaw-dropping surge in solar and wind capacity,” said Dorothy Mei, a project manager at Global Energy Monitor. “As we closely monitor the implementation of prospective projects, this detailed information becomes indispensable in navigating the country’s energy landscape.” The findings are in line with previous reports and government data released this year, which predicted that China could easily surpass its target of supplying a third of its power consumption through renewable sources by 2030. China’s green energy drive is part of its effort to meet dual carbon goals set out in 2020. As the world’s second largest economy, it is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and accounts for half of the world’s coal consumption. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, pledged in 2020 to achieve peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. The report attributed China’s remarkable progress in expanding its non-fossil energy sources to the range of policies its government has implemented, including generous subsidies to incentivise developers as well as regulations to put pressure on provincial governments and generating companies. China began operating the world’s largest hybrid solar-hydro power plant in the Tibetan plateau on Sunday. Named Kela, the plant can produce 2bn kW hours of electricity annually, equal to the energy consumption of more than 700,000 households. It is only the first phase of a massive clean energy project in the Yalong River basin. The installation has a 20GW capacity now and is expected to reach about 50GW by 2030. Despite China’s careful planning, its energy transition is not without its challenges. In recent years, record heatwaves and drought crippled hydropower stations, resulting in power crunches that brought factories to a halt. An outdated electricity grid and inflexibility in transferring energy between regions add to the uncertainty. The Kela plant is located in the sparsely populated west of the country, where more than three-quarters of coal, wind and solar power is generated. But the vast majority of energy consumption happens in the east. Transporting energy thousands of miles across the country results in inefficiencies. The way China’s grid is organised can incentivise building coal plants around renewable generators. Much of the new renewable capacity is not connected to the local energy supply and often bundled with coal power to be transmitted to areas of higher demand. More coal power was approved in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021. “China is making strides,” said Martin Weil, a researcher at Global Energy Monitor and an author of the report. “But with coal still holding sway as the dominant power source, the country needs bolder advancements in energy storage and green technologies for a secure energy future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T07:15:02Z","webTitle":"Bigger than Beckham: Messi has the power to realise soccer’s potential in the US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/bigger-than-beckham-messi-has-the-power-to-realise-soccers-potential-in-the-us","fields":{"bodyText":"Lionel Messi is taking his talents to South Beach – or, more accurately, Fort Lauderdale. That’s where he will play this summer after it was confirmed Inter Miami have won the race to sign arguably the greatest player of all time. It is the biggest transfer in Major League Soccer history. Bigger even than David Beckham’s move to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007. Beckham changed the soccer landscape in the US. His move to the Galaxy didn’t just push MLS into the American mainstream, it made the league a viable destination for some of the sport’s most recognisable names, and they don’t come more recognisable than Messi. Beckham, an Inter Miami co-owner, has brought things full circle by getting the GOAT to MLS. Inter Miami chased Messi for years. When the franchise was awarded an MLS expansion spot in 2018, the Argentinian congratulated Beckham. “Who knows, maybe in a few years you can give me a ring,” he said in a social media video. When Messi left Barcelona in 2021, Inter Miami were quickly on the phone to make an offer, although he chose Paris Saint-Germain, where Beckham also once played. Earlier this year, Beckham attended a PSG training session and was pictured with Messi – a move to Inter Miami was surely mentioned. Inter Miami were built around the idea Messi would one day join the club. Xavi Asensi was hired from Barcelona as the club’s chief business officer while Victor Oliver, another former Barça executive, was named a senior vice-president. Recent reports suggest the former Argentina and Barcelona coach Tata Martino has been approached about the club’s managerial vacancy. Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suárez have also been linked with a move to Inter Miami, who may end up looking like a Messi And Friends XI. On the pitch, Inter Miami are in bad shape. At PSG Messi lined up alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappé, in Miami he will be a teammate of Robert Taylor, once of Lincoln City. Messi may have to win games on his own to push his team up the table: they are bottom of the Eastern Conference and on a run of five straight league defeats. There are also questions over whether Inter Miami’s temporary 18,000-capacity DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale will be suitable for the coming circus. Could the much larger Hard Rock Stadium, home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, host some Inter Miami matches to sell more tickets? The appetite certainly appears to be there: Forbes reported that the cheapest tickets on resale websites for Messi’s possible home debut in August are exchanging hands for more than $500. Messi’s signing is about much more than just Inter Miami though. MLS has pulled all sorts of levers to make a deal for the World Cup winner possible because it believes he will kickstart a new phase of growth for the league, just as Beckham did 16 years ago. MLS has generally moved beyond its previous dependence on aging stars to attract new fans, but Messi is different – he can move the needle like nobody else. Beckham changed the league. MLS grew from 13 teams at the time of his signing to the current number of 29 – the league’s 30th franchise will join in 2025. Beckham sold 300,000 LA Galaxy jerseys a season during his five-and-a-half years at the club. He appeared on late-night talkshows and in adverts with NFL stars. Without the Englishman’s star power, MLS would look very different. With the 2026 World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico, on the horizon, and with Messi now an MLS player, the drive for growth in soccer in the US will reach new levels over the next three years. If MLS is to become one of the strongest leagues in the world, this period will be crucial. The allure of Miami itself should not be ignored. He already owns property there and his family are said to enjoy the city, which has a large Spanish-speaking population: language barriers should not be a problem for the Messis. The governing body of Argentinian soccer also plans to build a facility in Miami, and more and more South Americans are joining MLS. It’s possible Apple factored this, and the signing of Messi, into its decision to sign a record-breaking $2.5bn broadcast contract with MLS last year. Messi will reportedly receive a percentage of new MLS Season Pass subscriptions. A documentary series on the 35-year-old has already been ordered. AppleTV+ will essentially become MessiTV+. A percentage of Adidas jersey sales is also believed to be included in the unprecedented commercial package put together by MLS for Messi. The Argentinian’s face is already plastered on billboards around the world, but now it will be used to sell MLS – and the player himself appears to be banking on his own celebrity to make his time in the league as lucrative as possible. Never before has MLS given up so much to sign a player. Beckham had the chance to purchase a franchise for just $25m as part of his LA Galaxy contract, with the clause activated to create Inter Miami, but Messi’s overall package could be worth a lot more. “We have been pretty effective at coming up with clever ways to sign players for our clubs in the right market,” said MLS commissioner Don Garber earlier this year, hinting at the creativity used to draw up Messi’s deal. It will be worth it if Messi makes the impact so many expect him to. “I think of him as someone who crosses so many barriers that he can be bigger than any athlete of any sport that has ever played here in the United States,” said Garber. If Beckham’s move to MLS highlighted the potential of the league and soccer in the US, Messi could be the one who fully realises it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-masterclasses","sectionName":"Guardian Masterclasses","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T10:41:20Z","webTitle":"Harness the power of AI to boost your professional communications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/guardian-masterclasses/2023/mar/09/harness-the-power-of-ai-to-boost-your-professional-communications","fields":{"bodyText":"This course has now passed, but you can be the first to know about the next one - and other workshops like this - by signing up to our newsletter here.

The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, will move a 32-paragraph statement arguing the submarines are important to deter “aggression” and committing to deliver “well paid union jobs”. Labor will allow a debate on Friday morning on a motion that would remove a positive mention of Aukus from the party’s platform, ventilating the issue in a form unlikely to embarrass the government. Opponents of Aukus concede the push will not be successful. The Aukus nuclear-submarine acquisition is opposed by more than 50 Labor units, a mixture of party branches and federal electoral councils. It is also opposed by left-aligned unions including the Electrical Trades Union, Construction Forestry Maritime Mining Energy Union and Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. Unions will push to remove a reference to Aukus in the draft national platform, which states “our self-reliant defence policy will be enhanced by strong bilateral and multilateral defence relationships, including Aukus”. The maritime union official Christy Cain told Guardian Australia the Aukus plan to spend $368bn on nuclear-powered submarines while some argue more can’t be spent on housing is “the tail wagging the dog – it’s ridiculous”. The ETU national secretary, Michael Wright, said “our position is we don’t support nuclear except for its application in medical research”. The Labor Against War national convener, Marcus Strom, said “national conference is just the start of our campaign”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “It will be a victory for the rank and file just to force the debate on to conference floor. “Labor’s rank and file overwhelmingly oppose Aukus and see it as a loss of sovereignty, opening the door to a nuclear industry and a dangerous step putting Australia on an unnecessary ‘war footing’ with our largest trading partner.” Marles has engaged with Aukus critics for months to develop a compromise designed to recognise Labor has a tradition in nuclear non-proliferation and providing for the national security and defence of Australia. Marles and Conroy’s statement, to be appended to the platform, gives detailed reasons for Labor’s support for Aukus and an explanation of how nuclear-powered submarines can be delivered consistent with Labor values. It argues that “making our contribution to the collective security of our region and to the maintenance of the global rules-based order – so fundamental to Australia’s prosperity – is at the heart of Australia’s strategic intent behind acquiring a conventionally armed, modern and fit for purpose nuclear-powered submarine capability”. It notes that submarines will add to “Australia’s sovereign capability” and commits to build SSN-Aukus class submarines in South Australia “with a peak of 4,000 workers employed to design and build the infrastructure at Osborne and a further 4,000 to 5,500 jobs created to build the submarines”. “Building Australia’s military defence capability sits alongside our diplomatic efforts, as we play our part in collective deterrence of aggression,” it says. “By having strong defence capabilities of our own, and by working with partners investing in their own capabilities, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor. “Labor will redouble its efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, including the NPT. Labor will ensure Australia remains fully committed to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, known as the Treaty of Rarotonga. “Labor will uphold its proud history of championing practical disarmament efforts, its commitment to high non-proliferation standards and its enduring dedication to a world without nuclear weapons.” On Thursday the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the Coalition was “hand-in-glove with the government when it comes to the Aukus arrangement”. “But as we’ve seen, you’ve got hard left Labor members … they are vehemently opposed to the Aukus deal.” Dutton also claimed a leftwing backlash was “why the prime minister won’t initiate or won’t take part in the conversation about small modular reactors, zero emissions”. In his keynote speech on Thursday morning, Anthony Albanese said delivering for Australians meant “demonstrating our responsible approach to everything from the economy to foreign policy to national security”. Albanese also took aim at the Coalition’s energy policy, accusing them of “telling Australians with solar panels on their roofs to make way for a nuclear power plant in their back yard”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/apr/01/stormers-harlequins-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-01T16:54:36Z","webTitle":"Deon Fourie’s double helps Stormers to power-packed win over Harlequins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/apr/01/stormers-harlequins-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/apr/01/stormers-harlequins-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"Harlequins had found one way to escape the foul weather at home during the week. They travelled 6,000 miles to Cape Town, swapping Strawberry Hill for Table Mountain and a game played in sweltering 30C heat in a majestic stadium. Quins, led by Danny Care, were game opponents but a Stormers side with its all-Springbok front row, were always going to have a power game that would be difficult to cope with even after a week of acclimatisation in the sun and it is the Stormers who will meet the winners of Sunday’s match between Exeter and Montpellier. After the earlier dismantling of Munster by the Sharks, the South African sides have the air of guests who have been invited to the European party only to make off with all the booze. The scoreline is a trifle misleading. Quins scored three converted tries in the last seven minutes when the Stormers decided their work was done for the day. It was only then that Marcus Smith was able to sprinkle a little bit of his magic on proceedings. Quins can look devastating when a game opens up and their scrum coped well on a pitch that rapidly opened up, too, but for the other 73 minutes Stormers were in control. They had recorded emphatic wins over London Irish and Clermont at the DHL Stadium in the pool stages and Quins soon discovered that this citadel would be hard to storm. Quins had not laid a hand on the ball before the Stormers flanker Deon Fourie crossed their line after all of 55 seconds after a smart move down the blindside. The breathless start continued with an instant retort from Quins, Alex Dombrandt crashing over in the corner from a lineout. The No 8 did not have had a happy Six Nations, but he continues to thrive at club level. Smith’s conversion from the touchline helped settle those early nerves. Shrugs from the Stormers. They simply scored from a lineout of their own, their captain, Steven Kitshoff, barging his way over. Three tries in eight minutes was a nightmare for any watching defence coaches, but it was dream stuff for the marketing men. Quins earned a minor victory with a scrum won against the head and their defence looked pretty resolute as the waves of Stormers’ attacks continued, full-back Nick David twice stopping his opposite number, Damian Willemse, in his tracks. Just before the half-hour mark, though, Fourie, in the slipstream of a driving maul from a lineout, grabbed his second try. The Stormers somehow repelled some intense pressure from Quins before the interval, leaving the home side 10 points ahead before a welcome break from the heat. There was a sense that for all their sterling work Quins could not quite match the Stormers for power. Quins knew their number was up seven minutes after the break when an extraordinary finish by Willemse after a cross-kick from Manie Libbok. Willemse somehow evaded Joe Marchant’s tackle and the touchline to score in the corner for the Stormers’ fourth try. Libbok continued to spurn chances of conversions, but it hardly mattered, especially when the fly-half landed a long-distance penalty to stretch the lead. The visitors thrive on unstructured rugby and some of their handling as they mounted second-half attacks was outstanding, but the Stormers kept them at arm’s length with unyielding defence. Willie Engelbrecht, a replacement for the outstanding Fourie, rubbed salt into Harlequin wounds with a fifth try. Dombrandt’s second try and André Esterhuizen’s score, both made by Smith’s quick thinking, were terrific and some consolation before Marchant went over with the last move of the game. Fourie was given the man of the match award for his tireless efforts. The moment of the match was Willemse’s astonishing try. Quins knew this was never going to be a holiday in the sun and they are vulnerable when this competition enters the knockout stages. They remain the great entertainers of the Premiership but, with the playoffs looking out of reach, they would reflect on the long flight home that their season is as good as over."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T08:30:15Z","webTitle":"The week in TV: Succession; Great Expectations; The Power; Wellmania – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/02/succession-season-four-4-episode-one-1-review-great-expectations-bbc-steven-knight-olivia-colman-the-power-amazon-naomi-alderman-toni-collette-wellmania-netflix","fields":{"bodyText":"Succession (Sky Atlantic/Now) Great Expectations (BBC One) | iPlayer The Power (Amazon Prime Video) Wellmania (Netflix) And so, Sky Atlantic’s fourth and final 10-part season of Jesse Armstrong’s drama Succession arrives as per, with waiters swishing through bearing silver trays of costly, tasty-looking canapes that you sense are probably poisoned. The end of the last series saw Roy progeny Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Shiv (Sarah Snook) and Roman (Kieran Culkin) left reeling in the actual dust at their mother’s Tuscan wedding as billionaire patriarch-dementor Logan (Brian Cox) effectively blocked them from real power in family company Waystar Royco. There was an added twist of the dagger for Shiv from (now estranged) husband and Logan-stooge Tom (Matthew Macfayden), whose comic double act with Greg (Nicholas Braun) makes them Succession’s weasel-hearted answer to Ant and Dec. I’ve often felt too thick to watch Succession (all that sabre-rattling business speak). Also too common to appreciate the tsunami of super-rich signifiers (linen separates that scream “Existential crisis on Necker Island”; helicopters casually summoned like post-pub Ubers). All the well-heeled angst that makes you (almost, not quite) forgive them their great wealth. It’s all on warped view again in the first episode (titled The Munsters), as Logan strolls contemptuously around his birthday party, an event so grimly salubrious that he ends up hanging out with his bodyguard, telling him: “You’re my best pal.” Meanwhile, eldest Roy manchild Connor (Alan Ruck) frets that his 1% share of the US presidential race “could get squeezed”. Elsewhere, his siblings lifelessly gabble about their new “bespoke info hub” venture, barely bothering to towel-whip each other with one-liners (“Your face is giving me a headache”). Then they realise they might be able to outwit the old man on a major business deal. “This is not about getting back at Dad,” lies a suddenly alert Shiv. Peeking a few episodes ahead, rest assured that Succession is as magnificent as ever: a bravura television opera whose supple script, stealthy plotting and lurching twists provide all the mood music you need. Though in this coolly subdued opener it’s hard to know what’s uncoiling. A motorway pileup of estrangements (Shiv and Tom; Logan and “the rats”; Connor and any shred of common sense)? A show trial of Logan’s fatherly failings? Is that episode title a clue: as suspected, were the Roys always just the Munsters with weapons-grade affluenza? Whatever’s going on, adopt the brace position for the start of the endgame. On BBC One, Steven Knight (Peaky Blinders) is grinding everyone’s gears with his new six-part adaptation of Charles Dickens’s 1861 social-climbing odyssey Great Expectations, concerning young Pip’s craving to become a “gentleman”. This includes (spoilers ahead) reimagined everything: dialogue, scenes, order, as well as swearing and colourblind casting. And, to come: opium addiction and the kinky spanking of businessman Mr Pumblechook (played by Matt Berry, who arguably went through worse in Toast of London). Then there’s the question: is yet another interpretation necessary? The 2011 Sarah Phelps BBC adaptation starring Gillian Anderson and Ray Winstone is still on iPlayer. Then again, Knight (who also did A Christmas Carol), was, like Pip, raised in a blacksmithing family: how could his take not be interesting? Moreover, demented jilted bride Miss Havisham, played here by Olivia Colman, is one of the undisputed big-ticket “rock stars” of classical literature – are people truly tired of her? In the event it’s a mixed bag of an opener. There are strong showings, including Johnny Harris as desperate convict Magwitch, who accosts Pip on the grey, gloopy marshes, and nicely conjured atmospheres: silvery mists; candle flames tickling the gloom. However, despite the controversy, episode one is somewhat ponderous. It feels an age before Pumblechook arranges for child-Pip (Tom Sweet) to meet aloof ward Estella (Chloe Lea; the pair are played as adults by Fionn Whitehead and Shalom Brune-Franklin). The first instalment is practically over before La Havisham creaks into view. But what a Havisham this is: yes, a peak-bitter, eternally bridal nightmare of tatty antique lace, though with opium-glazed teeth and what resembles a toppling garden trellis of soiled, shredded bed linen on her head. Along with the madness, Colman plays her cold, cruel, furious; an implacable gothic Fury with beady alligator eyes. I love it. Far from a twittering, spacey, weeping willow of a Havisham, Colman’s hard, nasty take gives the character back her sting, her agency, her mojo. Ample enough reason, for now, to keep watching. The Power (Amazon Prime Video) is a nine-part adaptation of Naomi Alderman’s bestselling novel (named by Barack Obama as one of his favourite books of 2017). Created by Alderman, Claire Wilson and Raelle Tucker, it’s a global anthology about mainly young women developing the ability to produce electricity with their bodies; how it emboldens and galvanises them, but also turns the patriarchy against them. This is a bubbling sci-fi stew with echoes of Salem – for inevitably, once their fingertips start crackling and sparking, females are damned as witches. You can see why Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid’s Tale, is an admirer of Alderman’s: The Power’s themes include not only empowerment but fightback, survival, revenge and toxic masculinity. It’s Gilead with added electrons. In a pitch-perfect cast, standouts are Toni Collette playing a mayor (“Teen girls are setting shit on fire? I’m not surprised”), Toheeb Jimoh as a journalist, and the main young women: Halle Bush, Zrinka Cvitešić, Auli’i Cravalho and Ria Zmitrowicz, whose scenes with her terrifying London gangster father (a brilliant Eddie Marsan) are heart-stopping. While not flawless (a meandering start; too much padding), The Power is (dare I go there?) electrifying. On Netflix, there’s Wellmania, an eight-part Australian dramedy created by Brigid Delaney and Benjamin Law, based on Delaney’s book Wellmania: Misadventures in the Search For Wellness. It stars Celeste Barber (also known for spoofing the Instagram posts of the likes of Cindy Crawford) as a pushing-40, hard-partying New York-based food writer who gets stuck in Sydney because of physical and, it turns out, emotional issues. I was expecting an industrial skewering of the wellness industry, but apart from the odd pithy one-liner (“I jogged for the first time – I feel like I’ve been fucked by a truck”) this is more of an amusing Everywoman odyssey. You’ll need to like Liv, but that’s easy enough: slapping on deodorant, lounging in Spanx, Barber exudes a crisp comic energy. While Wellmania is a bumpy ride, if you stick with it, it gets deeper.

The Russian leader’s brief speech denouncing the Wagner group’s Yevgeny Prigozhin and his significant 24-hour mutiny, called off late on Saturday, showed he knows just how dangerous the situation could be for him. If he had a convincing plan for how to deal with it, he didn’t share it. Putin compared Prigozhin’s actions to the “intrigues” that he said brought down the Russian army, and then the state itself, in 1917. He wasn’t wrong – the rebellion was not unlike the way Russian army units left the front en masse during that military collapse. Putin’s defiant rhetoric promising to deal firmly with this treachery came after weeks of silence over the growing confrontation between Prigozhin and Russia’s regular military. Invoking what happened in 1917 may mean that Putin realised he had left this too late, and allowed a real challenge to the stability of his power in Russia to develop. Prigozhin, and the forces with him, were in no position to challenge Putin’s grip on power directly, even if they had wanted to. But indirectly, they have already shown the weakness of that grip. An armed force roamed southern Russia demanding recognition from the state authorities. That’s a long way from the unity of power that Putin had worked so long to enforce. Wagner had a longstanding close relationship with Russia’s military intelligence special forces, including shared bases and facilities. It was hard to know which way those forces would jump – or any of the other units deployed to block moves by Wagner’s main force further into Russia and towards Moscow. Units or groups from any of Russia’s military, paramilitary or intelligence organisations adjusting their allegiance to side with Prigozhin – or simply refusing to obstruct him – could have shifted the power balance swiftly. While it’s good news for Kyiv that some of Russia’s forces have been temporarily distracted, nobody should imagine that this development will lessen the threat to Ukraine and to Europe. Prigozhin’s argument is not with the war – it’s with how, and why, it is fought. This is a confrontation between some of the worst people in the world, in a dispute over how to destroy Ukraine the most efficiently. Ukraine is watching for an opportunity to turn Russia’s internal chaos into advantage on the frontline. Even with Prigozhin’s mutiny halted, it is bound to sow confusion and uncertainty among Russian soldiers and commanders more widely – and Ukrainian information operations should be adept at exploiting and increasing it. Russia moved to restrict internet access to reduce the reach of Prigozhin’s announcements. There was a delicious irony in the Russian authorities complaining about Wagner’s domination of the media narrative after all the years when Prigozhin was commissioned by Russia to run “troll farms” to do just that. This demonstration of Russia’s fragility only re-emphasises how vital it is to continue unqualified support for Ukraine. The suggestion that Russia cannot be defeated, and therefore it is better not to try and instead “negotiated settlement” is the only way forward, has been comprehensively torpedoed by this internal strife. But this is a temporary setback for Russia – and urgently increased support for Ukraine has the potential to bring about a permanent solution. Prigozhin’s challenge to Moscow was a confrontation between a psychopath leading a gang of murderous criminals and a mafia boss sitting in the Kremlin and dividing Russia’s riches between his cronies. But a distracted, weakened Russia is good news for everybody else.

Here are today’s key developments: Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious.” Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded in several parts of Ukraine during long-range Russian bombardments on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Zelenskiy’s office said. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reported that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for Vladimir Putin on a wanted list of suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. A new EU sanctions package will be adopted in the next two weeks, Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday, the Kyiv Independent reports. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons has condemned Russian president Vladimir Putin’s announcement on placing nuclear weapons in Belarus. “As long as President Putin has nuclear weapons, Europe cannot be safe. He justfies this dangerous escalation by citing decades of NATO nuclear sharing. As long as countries continue their complicity in considering nuclear weapons as anything other than a global problem, this helps give Putin cover to get away with this kind of behaviour,” ICAN’s interim executive director Daniel Hoegsta said in a statement. Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense Hanna Maliar went on Facebook to urge Ukrainians to not openly discuss details about the country’s upcoming offensive. “On live broadcasts, don’t ask experts questions [in the vein of] ‘how is the counter-offensive going?’, don’t write blogs or posts on this topic, and don’t discuss military plans of our army publicly at all. We have one strategic plan – to liberate all our territories. And as for the details – that’s simply a military secret,” Maliar wrote. She added that details “are disclosed by the three aforementioned officials only when there is a military task requiring it. Because information is also a weapon and we fight with it too,” referring to the supreme commander in chief (president), the defense minister, and the chief commander. Russian oil company Gazprom reduces gas export to EU through Ukraine by 15%, the Kyiv Independent reports. On March 24, Gazprom recorded a gas transit flow of 42.5 million cubic meters. A day later, the volume decreased to 36.2 million cubic meters. Here are some additional comments from president Putin on the agreement with Belarus. Russia will have completed the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus by July 1, Putin said, adding that Russia would not actually be transferring control of the arms to Minsk. He added that Russia has already stationed 10 aircraft in Belarus capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons, Reuters reports. Russia has struck a deal with neighbouring Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territory, Tass news agency quoted president Vladimir Putin as saying on Saturday. Such a move would not violate nuclear nonproliferation agreements, Putin said, adding that the United States had stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of European allies. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has long raised the issue of stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which borders Poland, Putin said. “We agreed with Lukashenko that we would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus without violating the nonproliferation regime,” Tass quoted Putin. The head of the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency will visit Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant next week to assess the serious security situation there, the IAEA said. Rafael Grossi said in a statement that the nuclear safety and security dangers at the Russian-held plant were “all too obvious”. The visit will be Grossi’s second to the plant, Reuters reports. Russia fired on a humanitarian aid delivery point in the city of Kherson on Saturday, injuring two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson regional military administration, said: “Russian occupiers continue shelling the places where civilians are provided with aid. “Last night the Russian army attacked a ‘point of invincibility’ in the Donetsk region’s Kostiantynivka. Today’s target for Russian artillery is a humanitarian aid delivery point in Kherson. “Two people were injured in enemy shelling, a 41-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man,” Prokudin added. The time in Kyiv is 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s news so far: The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war against Ukraine. The top commander of Ukraine’s military has said that his forces are pushing back against Russian troops in the long and grinding battle for the town of Bakhmut. British military intelligence also said Russia appeared to be moving to a defensive strategy in eastern Ukraine, Associated Press reported. “The Bakhmut direction is the most difficult. Thanks to the titanic efforts of the defence forces, the situation is being stabilised,” said Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi in a post on Telegram, giving a synopsis of a telephone call with Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s chief of defence staff. The seven-month battle for Bakhmut, where Russian forces have closed in on three sides, is the longest clash of the war, with Russia deploying regular soldiers and fighters of the mercenary Wagner group. Here are some of the latest images coming through from Ukraine: More than 5,000 former criminals have been pardoned after finishing their contracts to fight in Russia’s Wagner mercenary group against Ukraine, the founder of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said on Saturday. The Wagner group, originally staffed by battle-hardened veterans of the Russian armed forces, took on a much more prominent role in the Ukraine war after the Russian army suffered a series of humiliating defeats last year, Reuters reported. Prigozhin emerged from the shadows and recruited thousands of men from prisons, offering them the chance of freedom in return for serving in some of the most dangerous battles in Ukraine. “At the present time, more than 5,000 people have been released on pardon after completing their contracts with Wagner,” Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said in an audio clip posted on Telegram. Prigozhin said just 0.31% of those pardoned after Wagner service had gone on to commit crime, a figure he said was 10-20 times less than the standard indicators. Prigozhin, sometimes called “Putin’s Chef” for his sprawling catering businesses, is the most powerful of a group of Putin allies who now control what are essentially private armies that recruit top military officers, former spies and convicts. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spoke by phone with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and thanked him for his “positive attitude” in extending the Black Sea grain deal, the Turkish presidency said on Saturday. It said the two leaders discussed steps to improve Turkish-Russian relations, and developments regarding the war in Ukraine, and that Erdoğan expressed the importance of ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through negotiations as soon as possible, Reuters reported. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, has expressed concern to China over any provision of lethal aid to support Russia in its war against Ukraine during a meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Qin Gang. Mahuta’s press office on Saturday detailed her cautionary remarks in Beijing, days after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, concluded his trip to Moscow, where Xi and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, praised each other and spoke of a profound friendship, AP reported. Mahuta’s four-day trip, which began on Wednesday, was the first made by a New Zealand foreign minister to Beijing since 2018. It came at an awkward time, however, given Xi’s visit in the same week to give Putin a diplomatic boost after the international criminal court said it was seeking to put him on trial for alleged war crimes. On the Ukraine war, Mahuta reiterated her government’s condemnation of Moscow’s “illegal invasion”. Spring has arrived in Ukraine – with late March temperatures an unreasonably high 17C (63F) along much of the frontline in the east. It means it is possible to declare, definitively, that the Russian campaign to knock out Ukraine’s power grid has failed, and whatever happens next in the war, its people will not be frozen out of their homes, as was once feared when the cynical bombing campaign began on 10 October. The reality, of course, was the missile strikes on key infrastructure had been largely abandoned at the end of January, with Russian missile stocks at 10-15% of prewar levels, according to Ukrainian estimates. Moscow’s tactics are changing: Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Kyiv’s military intelligence, said in a TV interview that it appeared military fuel and “logistics systems” were now being targeted. There has been no shortage of bombing and fighting during the long winter, but in another sense little has happened. The battle for the small Donbas city of Bakhmut rages, as it has since last May, but in recent weeks Ukraine’s forces have been pushed back north and south of the city, leaving the urban centre increasingly isolated, its supply roads dangerously exposed. Drone footage depicts a battered urban landscape, although many buildings are still standing and troops are able to shelter in basements. As the weather turns, so too does talk of a Ukrainian counterattack. Kyiv’s forces are gradually taking delivery of previously promised western tanks, fighting vehicles and other munitions, and some of them have been freshly trained in Britain, Germany or Poland. But the country’s second most important commander, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, surprised most observers when he suggested, on Thursday, that the place for a counterstrike could be in or around Bakhmut itself. Russia’s parliament speaker has proposed banning the activities of the international criminal court (ICC) after the court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crimes. Vyacheslav Volodin, an ally of Putin’s, said on Saturday that Russian legislation should be amended to prohibit any activity of the ICC in Russia and to punish any who gave “assistance and support” to the court. “It is necessary to work out amendments to legislation prohibiting any activity of the ICC on the territory of our country,” Volodin said in a Telegram post, Reuters reported. Volodin said the US had legislated to prevent its citizens ever being tried by The Hague court and that Russia should continue that work. Any assistance or support for the ICC inside Russia, he said, should be punishable under law. The ICC issued an arrest warrant earlier this month accusing Putin of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. It said there were reasonable grounds to believe that Putin bears individual criminal responsibility. Russian officials have cautioned that any attempt to arrest Putin, Russia’s leader since the last day of 1999, would amount to a declaration of war. Police in Russia have placed a former speechwriter for President Vladimir Putin on a wanted list for criminal suspects, the latest step in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. The Associated Press reports that Abbas Gallyamov wrote speeches for Putin during the Russian leader’s 2008-12 stint as prime minister. Gallyamov later became an outspoken political consultant and analyst who was frequently quoted by Russian and foreign media. He has lived abroad in recent years. On Friday, Russian news outlets and an AP reporter discovered Gallyamov listed in the interior ministry’s database. His entry said he was wanted “in relation to a criminal code article” but did not include the law he was accused of breaking. Russia’s justice ministry added Gallyamov last month to its register of foreign agents, a designation that brings additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations aimed at undermining the recipient’s credibility. The ministry said Gallyamov “distributed materials created by foreign agents to an unlimited circle of people, spoke out against the special military operation in Ukraine [and] participated as an expert and respondent on information platforms provided by foreign structures”. Gallyamov told AP on Friday that he learned he was on a wanted list from the media. No law enforcement agency had been in touch, so he didn’t know what charge he faced in Russia. He said in a phone interview: I presume that formally it’s the offence of discrediting the army. It is being used against anyone who refuses to amplify the Kremlin’s playbook and tries to conduct an objective, impartial analysis of what’s going on. Gallyamov described the move against him as part of the Russian government’s “intimidation strategy”. Russia’s assault on the fiercely contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. It said in its latest intelligence update: This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force. Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence. The ministry said Russia’s situation had likely been worsened by “tensions between the Russian ministry of defence and Wagner Group, both of whom contribute troops in the sector”. The battle over Bakhmut has been the longest and bloodiest of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The UK ministry said Russia had probably shifted its operational focus towards Avdiivka, south of Bakhmut, and to the Kremina-Svatove sector in the north – “areas where Russia likely only aspires to stabilise its frontline”. This suggests an overall return to a more defensive operational design after inconclusive results from its attempts to conduct a general offensive since January 2023. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, have displayed a united front against authoritarian regimes as Biden visited the Canadian capital days after the leaders of China and Russia held a Moscow summit. Reuters reports that images of Biden and Trudeau standing side by side in Ottawa on Friday announcing agreements including on semiconductors and migration represented a counterpoint to the scene in Moscow days ago. There, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, professed friendship and pledged closer ties as Russia struggles in its war against Ukraine. At a joint news conference with Trudeau, Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China has not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Biden said the US had expanded alliances including with Nato, the G7, South Korea and the Quad nations of the US, Australia, India and Japan. We have significantly expanded our alliances. Tell me how in fact you see a circumstance where China has made a significant commitment to Russia. What commitment can they make? Addressing Canada’s parliament, Biden said that, as Nato members, the two countries would “defend every inch of Nato territory”. Trudeau told the news conference that Ukraine was a top issue: Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton to bring you up to speed with the latest developments. The leaders of the US and Canada, Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau, have met in Ottawa and reaffirmed their “steadfast support” for Ukraine just days after the Russian and Chinese presidents held their summit in Moscow. Biden questioned the level of China and Russia’s cooperation, noting that China had not provided weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine. Trudeau said: “Today we reaffirmed our steadfast support for the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against Putin’s brutal and barbaric invasion.” Meanwhile, Russia’s assault on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has “largely stalled”, the UK Ministry’s of Defence says. “This is likely primarily a result of extreme attrition of the Russian force,” the ministry said in its latest intelligence briefing. “Ukraine has also suffered heavy casualties during its defence.” More on both of those stories shortly. In other key developments just after 9am in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: At least 10 civilians were killed and 20 wounded from long-range Russian bombardments in several parts of Ukraine on Friday, officials said. The casualties included two people who died in heavy Russian shelling of the town of Bilopillia in Sumy province in northern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said. The United Nations has said it is “deeply concerned” by what it said were summary executions of prisoners of war by both Russian and Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. A new report from the UN’s office of the high commissioner for human rights said its monitors had documented dozens of the executions by both sides, that the actual number was likely higher and that they “may constitute war crimes”. The Russian former president Dmitry Medvedev said Moscow was readying for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that “everyone knows” Kyiv is preparing for. Medvedev, who is deputy chair of Putin’s powerful security council, warned that Moscow was ready to use “absolutely any weapon” if Ukraine attempted to retake the Crimean peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. Russian forces attacked northern and southern stretches of the front in eastern Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on Friday. Ukrainian military reports described heavy fighting along a line running from Lyman to Kupiansk, as well as in the south at Avdiivka on the outskirts of the Russian-held city of Donetsk. The US president, Joe Biden, said he believed China had not yet sent arms to Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. “I’ve been hearing now for the past three months China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia ... They haven’t yet,” he told a news conference on Friday. “Doesn’t mean they won’t, but they haven’t yet.” Ukraine claimed Russian forces were “running out of steam” in Bakhmut and its commanders have started to raise the prospect of an unlikely turnaround in the besieged eastern Ukrainian city. Three women were among at least five people killed after a Russian missile struck one of the “invincibility points” providing refuge and basic services for Ukrainian civilians in the eastern city of Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, local officials said. The Russians attacked overnight on Thursday with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, prosecutors said Air force commanders from Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark have agreed to create a unified Nordic air defence aimed at countering the rising threat from Russia, they said. The intention is to be able to operate jointly based on already known ways of operating under Nato, according to statements by the four countries’ armed forces. The Danish air force commander, Major General Jan Dam, said: “Our combined fleet can be compared to a large European country.” About 10,000 civilians, many of them elderly and with disabilities, are living in “very dire conditions” in and around Bakhmut, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Several thousand civilians were estimated to remain in the city itself and be “spending almost the entire days in intense shelling in the shelters”, the ICRC’s Umar Khan said. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said the “friendship” between China and Russia has limits, and that Europe should welcome any attempts by Beijing to distance itself from Moscow’s war in Ukraine. He said China “has not crossed any red lines for us”, adding that Beijing’s proposals to end the war showed it did not want to fully align with Russia. The bodies of 83 Ukrainian soldiers killed fighting in the war have been returned from the Russian side, a Ukrainian official said. Separately, Kyiv said it handed over an undisclosed number of seriously wounded Russian soldiers. Seven Ukrainian children have been reunited with their families after being forcibly taken to Russian-occupied Crimea, the Kherson regional military administration said. The security situation around the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv will have to improve before its ports can be included in a deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain, a senior Ukrainian official has said. The deal was extended this month, but Kyiv and Moscow differ over how long the extension will last."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/18/here-are-a-few-examples-of-people-brave-enough-to-stand-up-and-say-yeah-nah-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T06:27:38Z","webTitle":"Here are a few examples of people brave enough to stand up and say yeah nah to power | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/here-are-a-few-examples-of-people-brave-enough-to-stand-up-and-say-yeah-nah-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/here-are-a-few-examples-of-people-brave-enough-to-stand-up-and-say-yeah-nah-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-failed-assault-near-mala-tokmachka-raises-counteroffensive-challenges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T15:38:11Z","webTitle":"Ukraine’s failed Mala Tokmachka assault lays bare counteroffensive challenges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-failed-assault-near-mala-tokmachka-raises-counteroffensive-challenges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/14/ukraine-failed-assault-near-mala-tokmachka-raises-counteroffensive-challenges","fields":{"bodyText":"The footage that began circulating on Russian social media channels last week depicted what was portrayed as a significant military setback for Ukraine at the beginning of its counteroffensive. In a flat, open area south of Zaporizhzhia – bisected by hedges and a wide muddy track – about 12 Ukrainian armoured vehicles had become pinned down, bunched too close together near a minefield. In one video, shells and rockets can be seen tearing into the ground and into vehicles, including one of Ukraine’s new German-supplied Leopard tanks and US Bradleys. Soldiers can be seen running through the smoke from one damaged vehicle to another. When the shooting was finally over, several Ukrainian soldiers were dead. Smashed vehicles had been left abandoned. Russian commentators were crowing over the failure. The two sides have given conflicting accounts of what happened on the afternoon of 7 June, about 4km south of the village of Mala Tokmachka, with Moscow almost certainly overemphasising the importance of the engagement and Kyiv attempting to downplay it. Only now, amid the fog of war, is it possible to ascertain what happened. As part of a wider effort in that area of the frontline, 20 Ukrainian armoured vehicles led by two specialised mine-clearing vehicles set off in what appears to have been a “breaching operation”, targeting an area of higher ground held by Russian forces. Not long afterwards, brief posts on social media described how the column ran into difficulty close to a minefield, losing many of its vehicles. According to analysis by Deepstatemap, which tracks the status of the fighting in Ukraine, Kyiv’s forces attempted two separate attacks, the first involving nine vehicles, the second 11. It appears the first group encountered mines, which alerted Russian defenders to their presence. The second group was quickly spotted by Russian reconnaissance drones and came under heavy artillery fire. At some stage it appears that four Bradleys – possibly from the second group – were sent to help retrieve troops from where they had been pinned down. According to Ukrainian accounts, the Russian fire led to the loss of one Leopard tank and four armoured personnel carriers. Other vehicles, including a second Leopard, appear to have been damaged. There are claims that this tank too was abandoned. Despite efforts by Russian sources to suggest a wider setback for Ukrainian forces in the area, it appears that much of the footage that emerged in the aftermath showed the same engagements from different angles. According to staff sergeant Valerii Markus of the Ukrainian 47th brigade – which was involved in the incident – Russia had hugely exaggerated the brigades’ losses. In a video posted online this week, a visibly angry Markus said his brigade had lost five soldiers, not the large numbers claimed by Russia, and had inflicted far heavier losses on the Russian side. “It’s hard for our soldiers,” he said, aiming his anger at critics of what had occurred, “but they are fighting. They are recovering our land metre by fucking metre.” The details of the failed assault remain important because of what they reveal about the challenges Ukraine’s counteroffensive faces against defensive positions Russia has had a year to prepare that are supported by Moscow’s superior air power, which has been more visible since Ukraine began its offensive. Commenting on the events around Mala Tokmachka in an update in his Substack account, Phillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews, suggested that such losses were to be expected because of the nature of the fighting. “It’s clear that this operation will take a while. Ukraine is trying to do something that has not been successfully accomplished (perhaps ever) before. They are trying to execute a wide-scale offensive with the use of armoured vehicles without air supremacy against an entrenched enemy that possesses a large supply of defensive weaponry. “Many of the advantages Ukraine was able to use effectively in slowing any Russian advances to slower-than-snail pace over the last six months are now with the Russians. “The Ukrainians are having to contend with the fact that now they need to send forces forward, including tanks, APCs and other vehicles, and they must operate in an environment in which they are threatened by a large number of different systems – such as the almost ubiquitous handheld anti-vehicle missile.” That sentiment was underlined in a briefing from western officials on Wednesday that suggested Ukraine was taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces were being forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. “The vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,” one official said. The officials suggested there was likely to be “grinding, costly warfare” for many months to come. “This is incredibly difficult. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines … The idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people’s wildest dreams.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/aug/06/dusk-review-powerful-lars-von-trier-dogville","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-06T13:00:12Z","webTitle":"Dusk review – powerful exploration of Lars von Trier’s Dogville","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/06/dusk-review-powerful-lars-von-trier-dogville","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/aug/06/dusk-review-powerful-lars-von-trier-dogville","fields":{"bodyText":"A row of actors introduce themselves amenably and announce their upcoming play: they are going to adapt Lars von Trier’s 2003 film, Dogville, with its story of a fugitive woman given harbour by a small community in the Rocky Mountains in lieu of her labour, while one member of this troupe films the action. They enlist an additional actor, rising from within the audience, to play Graça, here escaping a quasi-fascist regime in Brazil. Adapted and directed by the Brazilian film and theatre-maker Christiane Jatahy, this production might be seen as part of a growing – at times frustratingly derivative – trend to bring well-loved films to the stage. What is refreshing here is that even though the film forms the basis for this intriguing show, it is not a straightforward adaptation by any means. Rather, it takes Von Trier’s framework of theatrical artifice, and his themes, to use them with utmost self-awareness. The relationship between film and theatre in the original is not in itself a straightforward one: Von Trier borrows from Brechtian black box theatre, with all the action on a soundstage. Here that dynamic shifts so that the drama on stage is edited and reproduced on a back-screen on to which live filmed footage is projected (along with English surtitles). Slowly we realise that there are pre-recorded edits sneaked into the film too and this prompts questions around truth, reality and representation, visually symbolised by Thomas Walgrave’s mirrored set design. Jatahy has said Von Trier’s film gathered new meaning for her after the election of Jair Bolsonaro’s government in Brazil in 2018. The production reflects on the exploitation of an outsider by a community sliding into tyranny and abuse, enacted on Graça both as unpaid labour and sexual violation. The townspeople, variously played by Véronique Alain, Paulo Camacho, Azelyne Cartigny, Philippe Duclos, Vincent Fontannaz, Delphine Hecquet, Viviane Pavillon, Matthieu Sampeur and Valerio Scamuffa, shift the furniture around, as if at a rehearsal, and remain actors as well as characters interacting with and gradually exerting control over Graça. It is an ambitious framework, a little flat and rambling for too long as the actors collect themselves in preparation for their play. But its complications pay off in some scenes of great suspense and hypnotic power, amplified by live piano (musical composition by Vitor Araújo) and Jean Keraudren’s slowly creepy sound design. At other times the production’s cleverness becomes confusing, with multiple visual and aural elements in play at once. Key scenes from the film are enacted, such as the breaking of Graça’s figurines, a child’s blackmailing demand to be smacked, the assaults and rapes. As powerful as these are, they are rather oblique and audiences who have not seen Dogville might be left puzzled by the lack of narrative context. Graça is not the mobster’s daughter of the film but a woman seeking asylum and there is more credence to her story here. Where Von Trier’s ending wreaked Old Testament violence, here there is a lecture as a conclusion, rather too pedagogic. The power of the production still wins out, and its ideas – on how we think we would welcome a stranger into our midst, and how we might betray ourselves by inches – stay potent in the mind.

NSW residents required 13,136 megawatts as Sydney recorded its hottest day in more than two years and the third highest on record for March. The low-intensity heatwave is expected to continue for Sydney, the Illawarra and Hunter regions until a cool change arrives on Wednesday afternoon. Jonathon Geddes from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said high temperature drove a peak demand at around 6pm Monday. The evening peak was the likely result of the sun going down and rooftop solar coming off the grid at the same time as people came home and wanted to use electricity for cooling and cooking purposes, according to Geddes. “It’s the highest demand we’ve seen in New South Wales since February 2020,” he said. “We have been in La Niña weather pattern for several years.” The national electricity market “held up well”, Geddes said, with enough generation to meet supply and no disruption to energy consumers related to the high demand. The total generation capacity in NSW stood at about 20,000MW, and 60,000MW in the national electricity markets, he said. The all-time record for electricity demand in NSW was 14,744MW in February 2011. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Geddes said peak demand was typically in summer during heatwave periods, as cooling required more energy than heating, resulting in more minimum-demand days in winter, spring and autumn. Jonathan How, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said because a heatwave was a combination of high daytime temperatures staying warm overnight, the body was not able to recover properly and that could pose a health risk. The conditions were often especially difficult for elderly Australians and those with medical conditions, How said. On Tuesday, temperatures reached 34C in the Sydney CBD and 36C at the airport at 2.30pm, with temperatures still rising. How said the hottest place in NSW on Tuesday was Williamtown in Newcastle, which reached 37.7C. More than 30 fires were burning in the state on Tuesday, 10 of which were yet to be brought under control. Prof Ollie Jay, director of the heat and health incubator at the University of Sydney, said exposure to extreme heat events that lasted for several days could cause heat-related illnesses, from heat exhaustion to heatstroke. People with heart disease were also susceptible, Jay said, because one of the first ways the human body responded to heat was to redistribute blood towards the skin. This meant the heart had to beat more often to stop blood pressure from dropping. People with kidney problems could also be more vulnerable during heat events due to dehydration caused by sweating, he said. Jay said most Australians coped with the heat by using air-conditioning. Older Australians were vulnerable as they might not have air-conditioning or use it due to a spike in electricity costs, he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T07:39:22Z","webTitle":"ACTU digs in on nuclear-free policy in headache for Labor over Aukus subs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","fields":{"bodyText":"Australian unions have restated their position in favour of a “nuclear-free defence policy”, creating a headache for the Albanese government over the $368bn Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition. The position, restated by Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil, on Tuesday, was seized on by the Coalition, which claimed it sent a “confusing signal” for Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines. Since the deal was announced earlier in March, the Albanese government has faced criticism from former prime ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, and former Labor ministers Doug Cameron, Gareth Evans, Kim Carr and Bob Carr. The Labor caucus has united behind the government’s position, with only MP Josh Wilson expressing public concerns, despite many unions opposing the nuclear submarine acquisition. Asked if she would have preferred the purchase of conventional submarines, O’Neil told the National Press Club that the ACTU had “a longstanding policy of opposition to nuclear power, nuclear waste and proliferation”. “We also have a longstanding policy position that supports a nuclear-free defence policy. “These are not positions that have been developed in the last weeks and months. They are decades long and our position hasn’t changed.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O’Neil said although the Aukus purchase of Virginia class and SSN Aukus class submarines was a “new announcement”, the ACTU’s had been “clear about these issues”. “The detail of the announcement that’s been made is something that we will bring our affiliates together to discuss over the coming months and we will want more detail from the government as well.” O’Neil’s comments suggest the ACTU could revisit its policy rather than seek to persuade Labor to abandon the nuclear submarine acquisition. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, said the Coalition had offered bipartisan defence on Aukus “because we know that it is a multigenerational, nation-building project that demands support from governments around the nation, industry and the private sector”. “For Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines sends a confusing signal to the Australian people,” he said in a statement. “It’s particularly damaging when the government has clearly articulated our strategic need for submarines and has promised the creation of 20,000 local jobs.” Hastie called on the ACTU to “adapt, as our strategic circumstances now demand”. “The ACTU should drop its archaic last-century stance on nuclear power, and work on growing Australian industry in the national interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-09T05:46:11Z","webTitle":"Australia and New Zealand best placed to survive nuclear apocalypse, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/09/australia-and-new-zealand-best-placed-to-survive-nuclear-apocalypse-study-finds","fields":{"bodyText":"The lucky country can count on one more piece of good fortune, with researchers finding Australia – followed by neighbour New Zealand – best placed to survive a nuclear winter and help reboot a collapsed human civilisation. The study published in the journal Risk Analysis describes Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as the island countries most capable of producing enough food for their populations after an “abrupt sunlight‐reducing catastrophe” such as a nuclear war, super volcano or asteroid strike. There would “likely be pockets of survivors around the planet in even the most severe” scenario, the researchers write – with those in the most resilient nations standing the best chance of avoiding a pre-industrial collapse. The authors compared 38 island countries on 13 factors they said could predict success as a post-apocalyptic survival state, including food production, energy self-sufficiency, manufacturing and the disaster’s effect on climate. Australia and New Zealand – both robust agricultural producers and tucked away from the likely sites of northern hemisphere nuclear fallout – topped the tables, with Australia performing best overall. “Australia’s food supply buffer is gigantic,” the study concludes, “with potential to feed many tens of millions of extra people.” Australia’s relatively good infrastructure, vast energy surplus, high health security and defence budget all aided in pushing it to the top of the table. Australia did have one major factor working against it, however: its relatively close military ties with the UK and US made it more likely to become a target in a nuclear war. In this area, New Zealand displayed some advantages, the authors said, with its longstanding nuclear-free status. Its resilience in the event of an abrupt drop in global temperature prompted by a period of darkness (everywhere in New Zealand is relatively close to the ocean, cushioning it from extreme temperature plunges) would also help. “We have this super efficient food export economy that could feed New Zealanders multiple times over just from exports,” said one of the study’s authors, Prof Nick Wilson from the University of Otago, Wellington. Even in the worst-case scenario – a 61% reduction in crops during a prolonged nuclear winter – New Zealanders would still have enough to eat, he added. Despite New Zealand’s abundance of food and its high ranking on social cohesion metrics, a shutdown of global trade could precipitate social collapse by degrees, Wilson added. “I am concerned about a false security for New Zealand,” Wilson said. The country no longer had any facility refining fuel and is intensely dependent on imports for the diesel, pesticides and machinery needed to sustain its dominant agricultural sector. Other island countries would be able to produce enough food in such a crisis, Wilson and co-author Dr Matt Boyd wrote, but the likely collapse of industry and social cohesion put their resilience in doubt. China, Russia and the United States could see food production fall up to 97% under nuclear winter models and would be forced to rely on new food production technologies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-13T11:24:50Z","webTitle":"Young Thais look to Pita Limjaroenrat to bust military-royalist grip on power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/13/pita-limjaroenrat-thailand-pm-hopeful-embraced-by-young-voters-desperate-for-change","fields":{"bodyText":"When Pita Limjaroenrat took to the stage for his final big campaign event before Thailand’s elections, the cheers and screams were deafening. “Our time has come,” he told crowds of mostly young supporters in a packed stadium in Bangkok. Pita’s Move Forward party has built a large and loyal support base among young Thais who are fed up with the political status quo. At rallies, he is met with long lines of students and young people queueing for selfies. On TikTok, fans post images of themselves with a special filter that displays his face smiling and lurking in the background. Pita has promised to push military generals back to the barracks – a pledge that resonates with young people who have already lived through two military coups, in 2006 and 2014. He has also promised to break up powerful monopolies that dominate the Thai economy, and reform the lese-majesty law, under which criticism of the monarchy can be punished with up to 15 years in prison. Move Forward is the only party to make a clear commitment to reform the law; conservative parties all fiercely oppose doing so. “The wind of change has been blowing,” Pita said at the rally on Friday night, a final push before Sunday’s election. “What we need to carefully and maturely ask ourselves is, is Thai society building a wall, or a wind turbine?” In 2020, mass youth-led protests shocked the establishment by calling for changes to the military and curbs on the wealth and influence of Thailand’s monarchy, an institution previously seen as untouchable. More than 240 people have since been charged with lese-majesty – including former protesters who are now running as Move Forward candidates. Speaking on Friday night, Pita referred to a high-profile case involving a 15-year-old girl who was held for more than 40 days in pre-trial detention after she was accused of criticising the monarchy. A sensible debate was needed, he said. Pita, 42, grew up in a political family. His father, Pongsak Limjaroenrat, was an adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture, and his uncle, Padung Limcharoenrat, was a close aide of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. It was time spent studying in New Zealand as a teenager that truly sparked his love for politics, however. “I got shipped to the middle of nowhere in New Zealand and there were three channels back then. Either you watch Australian soap operas, or you watch the debates in parliament,” he told the Thai YouTube programme Aim Hour. He began to listen to the then New Zealand prime minister Jim Bolger’s speeches as he did his homework. Pita graduated from Thammasat University in Bangkok, before studying for a master’s degree in public policy at Harvard University, and an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the executive director of Grab Thailand, a ride-hailing and food delivery app, before joining politics. He told the Guardian that Thailand had experienced a lost decade under Prayuth Chan-ocha, the incumbent prime minister who first took power in a coup in 2014. “Democratic institutions and norms have been broken,” he said, adding that the economy was “in a tailspin”. Thailand’s economy had slumped compared with its neighbours in south-east Asia. Pita has been praised for his firm but polite debating style, and he has ranked well in polling for Thailand’s preferred prime minister. But Move Forward has also made powerful enemies by promising to make changes to the conservative military-royalist establishment. Pheu Thai, an opposition party which is projected to win the most seats, may be deterred from forming an alliance with Pita’s party, fearing that its policies, especially those relating to the monarchy, are too sensitive. Move Forward party’s predecessor, Future Forward, which was also outspoken in calling for change, was closed down in 2020 after a court ruled it had broken funding regulations. Its supporters saw the case as politically motivated, and it was one of the triggers for the 2020 protest movement. Pita said it was unsurprising that some opposed Move Forward’s promise of change. “The definition of change is that some will be gainers, and some will be losers. But 99% will gain from our policies,” he said. Last week, a complaint was filed against Pita, claiming that he owns undeclared shares in a media company. He has denied any wrongdoing and told the Guardian the case was just “dirty old politics”. “We’re not concerned,” he said. But added: “We’re not reckless as well. We have a strong legal team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/live/2023/aug/21/hilary-tropical-storm-california-flood-warnings-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-21T22:00:40Z","webTitle":"Storm Hilary aftermath: 10,000 without power, Palm Springs declares emergency and new storm heads for Texas – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/21/hilary-tropical-storm-california-flood-warnings-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/21/hilary-tropical-storm-california-flood-warnings-live-updates","fields":{"bodyText":"Hilary has continued to track north, and is expected to bring rain and strong winds to the intermountain west, as well pas parts of Arizona and Utah.

Governor Gavin Newsom of California declared a state of emergency in several southern California counties. Palm Spring officials declared a state of emergency in the southern California city amid intense flooding cause by Storm Hilary. The typically-dry city broke its August daily rainfall record by more than an inch on Sunday, receiving 3.18in of rain.

Another tropical storm is headed for Texas, forecasters warn. The storm is expected to hit the southern part of Texas’ coast tomorrow and will be called Harold if it is named. – Guardian staff Tomorrow morning, 1-2 inches rain could fall over central and northern portions of the Intermountain West, northern Arizona and central Utah, according to the National Hurricane Center. Strong winds area also expected throughout the region. In southern California, the worst of the storm seems to have passed, but officials are warning residents to remain careful while responders restore roads and infrastructure. Daniel Swain, the UCLA climate scientist who has made a name for himself breaking down the complexities of extreme weather and the climate crisis on social media and on his personal blog, said it has been harder lately to take in and transmit disaster updates via X, formerly known as Twitter. Since Elon Musk took over the social media company, its platform has been glitchier. Teams responsible for moderating and curtailing misinformation on the app have been made redundant, and conspiracy theories have flourished. A January report found that Tweets containing “climate scam” or other terms linked to climate change denial increased 300% in 2022. “Twitter was, by the way for the first time that I can remember since I started using it in 2011, almost completely useless yesterday,” said Swain, during a live-streamed update on the impact and path of the tropical storm. “A lot of the information that was there about California weather and Hillary was either conspiracy theories, fabricated.” US senator Ted Cruz of Texas, was among those who were mislead by misinformation about the storm, sharing a hoax picture of a shark on a flooded highway in Los Angeles with the remark: “Holy crap.” “I’m still on Twitter, because even in it’s vastly degraded and still declining form it is still better than the alternatives,” Swain said. “But there will come a point I think where that’s no longer true, right?” Will all this rain cut down the California’s wildfire risks in the coming dry months? Not really, said UCLA climate scientists Daniel Swain. The storm hasn’t brought much precipitation to northern California, and the fire season there won’t be affected at all. Patchy rainfall in central California and the Bay area could stave off fires for a few more weeks. But even in southern California, which saw record rainfall, all this moisture doesn’t mean the region won’t experience destructive wildfires later this year. “I don’t think we’re gonna have to worry about fires for at least a few weeks,” he said. But by the autumn, as the landscape dries again, “you can still have a very active fire season”. Another sign of how unusual the current weather is in California: There’s a tornado warning over the busy I-5 highway in southern California. Here’s a visual breakdown of Hilary’s extraordinary path – compared with all tropical cyclones on record in region. Hilary’s effects are being felt as far north as Boise, Idaho, setting a seven-decade record for the highest atmospheric moisture observed there. Storm Hilary brought 350% more rainfall than normal for this time of month in parts of California and Nevada, the National Weather Service (NWS) announced. The historic storm brought between one to eight inches of rain above the average amount in areas of southern California, southern Nevada, and the southern Sierra region, announced the weather service on Twitter, now known as X. It is 11.45 am pst (6.45 pm gmt) in California. Here’s what has happened so far concerning Storm Hilary: Over 10,000 customers are still without power in Los Angels county, according to data from poweroutage.us. Other southern California counties have mostly restored power. Palm Spring officials have declared a state of emergency in the southern California city amid intense flooding cause by Storm Hilary, the Palm Springs Fire Department posted to Facebook. A tropical storm is headed for Texas, forecasters warn. The storm is expected to hit the southern part of Texas’ coast tomorrow and will be called Harold if it is named. Experts warn that Storm Hilary could create “life-threatening” conditions, despite its downgrade Monday morning. Forecasters said that the historic storm could bring flooding and mudslides to southern parts of California. 25 million people from southern California to northern Idaho were under flood warnings as of Monday morning after heavy rain fall from Hilary. Stay turned for further updates. Hurricane Hilary is a highly unusual occurrence – so rare, that there’s not much research on tropical cyclones in California, and whether such storms might increase due to global heating. It is clear that the climate crisis is fueling extreme weather, and supercharging hurricanes. “Warmer oceans are hurricane fuel,” said UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain – and studies show that global heating can cause more frequent, wetter hurricanes. The rapid intensification of storms has also become more common in a warming world. But California has several natural defenses against hurricanes. Cold ocean temperatures along the state’s coast tend to deflate tropical storms, and its strong east-west winds tend to blow hurricanes away. The downward flow of air across the state also tends to squash down storms. “To my knowledge, no one has ever done a formal study on tropical cyclone hazard in a warming climate in California.” Swain said. And because California’s geography is so different than other parts of the world where hurricanes are common, studies from elsewhere don’t provide reliable insight into what is happening now. Unusual weather patterns in the Pacific this year, including record high Pacific Ocean temperatures and the combination of a low pressure area along the west coast and a high pressure ridge in the central US created the perfect conditions for a powerful storm to build off Baja California, Mexico that was pulled north through the US. While it is plausible that much warmer temperatures in the eastern Pacific could fuel more such storms, the unique topography and wind conditions in California could still impede sequel’s to this week’s tropical storm, Swain said. Such storms “will remain a rare event in any foreseeable future,” he said. Until Hilary, no tropical storm had made landfall in Southern California since 1939, according to the National Weather Service. And meteorologists believe the only tropical cyclone churning at hurricane-force was in 1858. There is a consensus among researchers that the state is likely to see more wet, intense winter storms – as it did this past winter – as well as more frequent heat waves and more destructive wildfire. More than 10,000 people are still experiencing power outages in Los Angeles county, according to data from poweroutage.us, which tracks US outages. The county was severely impacted by Storm Hilary, as flooding and rain damaged roads and power lines. Other counties within southern California have restored power. In San Diego, only 487 customers are without power. San Bernardino county has similarly lower rates of power outages, with only 645 customers without power. Palm Springs officials have declared a local state of emergency amid ongoing flooding from Storm Hilary. The Palm Springs City manager gave the declaration as flooding continues in the southern California city. “Due to unprecedented rainfall and flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue, Palm Springs city manager Scott C Stiles has declared a local emergency due to the critically dangerous impacts of Hurricane Hilary,” the Palm Springs Fire Department posted in a message on Facebook. “Palm Springs police and fire continue to urge residents to stay home and avoid driving during these dangerous conditions,” fire officials added. Here’s more on major flooding caused by Storm Hilary that could impact California, by the Guardian’s Oliver Milman. Tropical Storm Hilary has weakened after slamming into California but is still set to cause “catastrophic” flooding, forecasters have warned, with the rare storm unleashing historic levels of rainfall to the US south-west. The National Hurricane Center by Monday morning had downgraded Hilary to a post-tropical cyclone but added that the storm would still bring a “historic amount of rainfall” that is expected to cause “life-threatening to locally catastrophic flash, urban and arroyo flooding”. The storm would also pack strong winds – of about 30mph – and potential landslides and mudslides. Hilary, the first tropical storm to make landfall in southern California in 84 years, has caused roads to flood and trees to be uprooted, and prompted the shuttering of schools and cancellation of flights as more than 25 million people face flood warnings from the event. Residents of Los Angeles and San Bernardino county were urged to stay at home. Evacuations have also taken place in many areas. The National Weather Service tweeted on Monday that “virtually all rainfall daily records have been broken thus far” in the Los Angeles area. Read the full article here. Satellite images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) show the progression of other ongoing tropical storms like Franklin and Gert, as well post-tropical cyclone Emily. The National Hurricane Center said Franklin is slowing down over the Caribbean Sea. “Heavy rainfall is expected for Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.” Gert is “still there but could dissipate any time.” Emily, which formed over the weekend, has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a “remnant low,” a post-tropical cyclone. Texas is experiencing a summer of severe drought, so the rainfall is much needed for the southern region of the state and some parts of Louisiana. However, the rest of the state has yet to see any relief. Over the summer, Governor Greg Abbott issued disaster declarations in over 100 counties experiencing the dangerously dry conditions. The record-breaking heat has increased the risk of wildfires in the state and threatened vegetation. A tropical storm is now heading for Texas. The weather channel announced a tropical storm warning is in effect for the state’s Gulf Coast. Impact is expected tomorrow. The storm will be known as Harold if it is named. A major road in Las Vegas is closed due to damage caused by the historic storm, transportation officials announced on Monday. Nevada Department of Transportation for the Las Vegas area said that parts of the Kyle Canyon road are closed due to flood damage, said officials on Twitter, now known as X. “Crews are assessing the situation. There is no updated estimate for reopening at this time,” said officials. A boil order has been issued for some Nevada residents as Hilary’s downpour damaged water systems. Residents who use Kyle Canyon Water System have been placed under an emergency boil order after the storm damaged local water systems, KSNV Las Vegas reported. Overnight flooding in areas of Clark county, Nevada caused a major reservoir in the county to leak. Officials have placed some residents under the boil order as crews examine damage and make repairs. The Lake Meade recreation area will be closed on Monday due to effects of the intense storm. The popular attraction was be closed Monday “for the purposes of maintaining public healthand safety due”, said park officials, reported USA Today. The national park, home to the nation’s largest man made reservoir, also experienced power outages and other utility problems due to the storm. Experts are warning people not to walk through flood waters, which could contain dangerous bacteria. From the Weather Channel: It is 6.45 am pst (1.45 pm gmt) in California, where Hilary caused massive flooding and record rainfall. Here are photos showing the intense levels of rain and flooding in the Southern California area. First responders rescued over a dozen unhoused people who were trapped in knee-deep water in southern California, AP reported. Fire officials saved 13 people who were caught in a flooded homeless encampment near the San Diego River. San Diego officials said on Friday that that city has been doing outreach to provide shelter beds to unhoused communities ahead of the storms. “Weather’s just one more thing that wreaks havoc on the lives of people who are unsheltered, whether it’s the extreme heat that we’ve been having, whether it’s this potential tropical storm bringing all this rain and wind,” Michael McConnell, a homeless advocate, said during a Friday press conference, CBS News 8 reported. “It damages people’s property, it can hurt their health, put them in dangerous situations if they’re in flood zones, you name it, it’s just dangerous for people out here on the street.” Forecasters warn that Tropical Storm Hilary could still be “life-threatening” despite being downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone on Monday, AP reported. Officials with the National Hurricane Center in Miami warned in a Monday advisory that “continued life-threatening and locally catastrophic flooding” were expected in areas of the US south-west. Experts have warned that flooding and mudslides could target the region. Coastal warnings have been discontinued, AP further reported. Tropical Storm Hilary hit parts of Mexico and southern California on Sunday, with mud slides and additional flooding still expected, Associated Press reported. Hilary is the first tropical storm to hit southern California in 84 years, as forecasters warn that such extreme weather events are tied to climate change. Hilary caused record rain throughout the southern California region, with cities like Palm Springs experiencing downpours of nearly 3.18 inches, a higher amount for the area than usual. Good morning. Tropical Storm Hilary brought record rain and flooding to much of the US south-west region this past weekend. Forecasters warn that additional flooding and mudslides are still possible as millions are still under flood warnings, CBS News reported. Though the storm has been downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone as of Monday morning, nearly 25 million people from California to parts of northern Idaho are under flood warnings, CNN reported. The storm left many parts of southern California underwater, NPR reported. Thousands in the region were without power, as schools have largely closed on Monday due to the natural disaster.

On Thursday, the findings of an inquiry into whether he misled MPs by repeatedly denying Covid laws were broken in Downing Street will be published. What is the privileges committee? The special body known as the committee of privileges looks into allegations that an MP has committed contempt of parliament. Misleading the Commons, as opposition parties and some Tory MPs alleged Johnson has done, comes under this category. While the committee has conducted numerous investigations before, the sitting prime minister has never previously been referred to it for scrutiny. Who sits on it? A cross-party group of seven MPs make up the committee. They are usually the same members as sit on the standards committee, given the two used to be combined until 2010. Unlike the standards committee, the privileges committee does not have any extra lay members – independent people who are not politicians – appointed to sit on it. There is an in-built government majority, with the four Conservative MPs consisting of Alberto Costa, Bernard Jenkin, Andy Carter and Charles Walker. Labour’s Harriet Harman is the chair, and another spot is held by Yvonne Fovargue, while the Scottish National party has one member, Allan Dorans. It is one of only two committees that House of Commons rules dictate must have a Labour chair. It was led by Chris Bryant, but he had been a vocal critic of Johnson over Partygate so recused himself from the investigation and was replaced by Harman. How did its investigation progress? All MPs passed a motion last April instructing the committee to investigate whether Johnson misled parliament. MPs on the committee demanded bundles of evidence, including WhatsApps, door logs and diaries kept by Johnson and his aides during the pandemic. It did not set out to reinvestigate rule-breaking (given the police had already done so), but whether Johnson told the truth when he denied any Covid rules were broken and claimed he was repeatedly assured events in No 10 were within the rules. The inquiry was slow to start; the government redacted large swathes of evidence, Harman took over from Bryant, and a Tory member was also replaced when they stepped down. The death of the Queen also delayed proceedings. As the months went on, the committee tried to continue its work through a turbulent political environment – the downfall of Johnson’s government, followed by Liz Truss and then the rocky start faced by Rishi Sunak. The government eventually relented and handed over unredacted evidence. Questionnaires were sent by the committee to witnesses, and a date was set for Johnson to give evidence in March 2022. After his televised testimony session, the process was held up again by a new cache of files being handed to the committee by civil servants who were combing Johnson’s diaries in preparation for handing them over to the public inquiry into Covid. The committee sent off its findings to Johnson in private last Thursday, giving him two weeks to respond. But Johnson claimed it had unfairly found against him and resigned as an MP to avoid facing any sanction. The timetable for the report’s release was brought forward. But it faced one final delay this week. The report was meant to be signed off by the committee on Monday, but Johnson sent a final submission that evening at 11:57pm. The report was finally formally completed on Tuesday, and is set to be published on Thursday. What will happen next? After the report is published, it will be up to the government to table a motion endorsing its findings. MPs can vote for or against it, abstain, and even table amendments, if they wish. Government insiders have been drawing up plans for a motion that says the Commons has “noted” the report, rather than the traditional form of words for a committee report, which says MPs have “accepted” it. Such a move is viewed as a way of encouraging Johnson’s supporters not to vote against the motion and spark further internal party ructions. The Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt, is expected to announce the date of the vote on Thursday morning. Sources said the vote was likely to be on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-20T15:00:00Z","webTitle":"Parties, power, racing: meet Ovo’s Stephen Fitzpatrick, the man who would be Richard Branson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/20/parties-power-racing-meet-ovos-stephen-fitzpatrick-the-man-who-would-be-richard-branson","fields":{"bodyText":"Pink flamingos once strolled around a rooftop garden set high above the traffic of Kensington High Street in west London, where stars including Madonna and George Harrison rubbed shoulders with the business elite. The exclusive party venue was owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin for 37 years before closing in 2018 after struggling to make a profit. Now, an unlikely figure is trying to resurrect Kensington Roof Gardens with a plan to reopen it as a private members’ club. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of Britain’s fourth-biggest gas and electricity supplier, Ovo Energy, has chosen an awkward time to reopen the luxury venue, just as millions of households struggle amid an energy crisis that has stretched their finances to the limit with soaring utility bills. But Fitzpatrick loves the high life: the serial entrepreneur has taken much inspiration from the bearded billionaire and his Virgin Group. He has dabbled in everything from energy and software to premium rum. His most eyecatching venture – rescuing the Manor Racing Formula One team in 2015 and reportedly pumping in £30m – ended with the business falling into administration in 2017, having secured a solitary point. Branson had spearheaded the same team, then branded Virgin Racing, eight years earlier. Fitzpatrick also shares Branson’s love of aviation and bold new ventures, and has even modelled the structure of his group on the one used by Britain’s best-known entrepreneur. “We have followed the Virgin story very closely,” he said in 2016. From a cluster of gleaming properties a short walk from the roof gardens, he runs the ventures that have amassed him a fortune estimated at £2.2bn. Ovo is now even reportedly considering another blockbuster acquisition, of struggling Shell Energy’s 1.4 million customers. But the former Tory donor, whose stake in Ovo is worth an estimated £2bn, faces a series of challenges to keep his ventures on track. Sources claim Fitzpatrick continues to take a close interest in politics too, although neither he nor his firms have made a political donation since the £185,000 handed to the Conservative party in 2019, when Labour was threatening to renationalise energy companies. Meanwhile, his Marmite personality has made him a divisive figure among peers and colleagues. To some, he is an ambitious trailblazer, to others a flashy hard-driver intent on being seen as a tech visionary but with a patchy record. A detailed analysis of Fitzpatrick’s ventures reveals he has quietly transferred control of Ovo during the energy crisis, has taken a hit to his wealth from his flying taxis venture and shut down a project designed to share his business acumen with other companies. He declined to comment for this article. The energy egg hatches The Northern Irishman, 45, founded Ovo in the teeth of the financial crisis in 2009. The Edinburgh University graduate had set up a free property listings newspaper and website in Scotland in 2001 but shut the business down after realising its limitations. A stint in the City followed, as a trader at Société Générale and JP Morgan, before he launched the energy supplier with his wife, Sophy, using £350,000 of savings. Ovo – from the Latin for egg – grew, rapidly amassing more than 1,000 employees in London and Bristol as a result of its eyecatching marketing and green energy tariffs. Fitzpatrick spent Ovo’s formative years bemoaning the dominance of “legacy” suppliers such as British Gas, accusing them of poor service and ripping off loyal customers. “He really was Mr Angry in the early years,” recalls one former insider at the energy regulator, Ofgem. “He was constantly accusing us and the government of being ineffectual and protecting the existing big guys. He took himself very seriously.” The government later intervened, introducing the Ofgem price cap in 2019, designed to protect consumers who did not switch from being overcharged. It would later contribute to almost 30 suppliers collapsing as gas prices soared. Meanwhile, Ovo was on the acquisition trail, first taking over rival Spark Energy in 2018, and then, on the eve of the pandemic, completing a transformative deal – snapping up the retail arm of energy and cables titan SSE for £500m after its merger with npower collapsed. The deal saw Ovo take its customer base from 1.5 million to almost 5 million. “He went from David to Goliath with one deal,” says one industry chief executive. (Shortly before this, in early 2020, Ovo had also been fined nearly £9m for sending inaccurate bills for three years.) That deal thrust Fitzpatrick and his swollen energy empire into the spotlight just as the pandemic hit, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 then sending bills rocketing. Ovo faced questions over taking £17m in furlough money after making £40m of payments and loans to other Fitzpatrick companies, and MPs called on Ovo to be “transparent about its books”. Fitzpatrick was criticised for living in a £3.2m Cotswolds mansion while Ovo encouraged struggling consumers to “cuddle your pets” to keep warm. Then Ovo considered gazumping Octopus’s acquisition of bust supplier Bulb and was accused of making further billing errors. Ovo responded by scaling down, cutting a quarter of its 6,200 workforce early last year and later selling its telecoms and revenue protection businesses. At the same time, operations chief Raman Bhatia was promoted to run its retail arm, Fitzpatrick having taken a step back from Ovo’s day-to-day running. ‘Uncertainty’ Last year, it emerged Ovo’s parent company, Imagination Industries, had made £27m in loans to Fitzpatrick and its only other director – Ovo’s finance chief, Vincent Casey. In the same accounts, auditor PwC said there was “material uncertainty” over Imagination’s ability to continue as a going concern. It said the group was “exposed to short-term volatility in wholesale commodity prices and credit losses caused by the UK cost of living crisis” and said the group was “forecasting to breach financial covenants with trading creditors”. In 2013, Fitzpatrick faced scrutiny over taking £2m out of then-lossmaking Ovo to fund the purchase of a house in the Cotswolds. Imagination Industries also handed a £10m interest-free loan to his Manor Formula One team in 2015. Customers’ credit balances on their energy accounts, which are typically built up in the summer and run down in the winter, have also been a source of controversy. Ofgem has said it asked Ovo to stop using customer credit balances as working capital in “about 2015, 2016”. It is understood the regulator had concerns that Fitzpatrick was using customer money to fund Manor. Fitzpatrick has said there was “absolutely no financial link” between Ovo and Manor. A row over the issue resurfaced last year, as Ofgem ruled against ringfencing credit balances despite earlier accusing unnamed firms of using customer money “like an interest-free company credit card”. Sources said Ovo had resisted proposals to ringfence customer deposits last year. Research last month showed energy suppliers were hoarding nearly £7bn of customers’ money despite the cost of living crisis. In February, Ofgem said Ovo was among four suppliers it was engaging with to “secure improvements or adequate reassurance of compliance” on direct debit levels. Ovo has previously declined to disclose how much customer money it holds, or the average credit balance. However, it is understood Ovo has argued it does not use credit balances to fund growth and that, on average, customers owe it more money than Ovo owes to them during each year. A shift in control Since 2014, Fitzpatrick has modelled Ovo’s corporate structure on Branson’s Virgin, with a holding company – Imagination – collecting royalties from its public brand. Company filings now show that control of Ovo switched from Imagination to another business, Energy Transition Holdings (ETH), in late March; customers and the media were not proactively informed of this at the time. Imagination is controlled by Fitzpatrick, with Casey the only other director. ETH is another Fitzpatrick vehicle, with directors which mirror Ovo’s: namely Fitzpatrick, Casey, chair Stephen Murphy and director Go Muromoto, a representative of Mitsubishi, which took a 20% stake in Ovo, valuing the business at £1bn, in 2019. It is now valued at £3bn. They are joined on both boards by two directors from private equity outfit Mayfair Equity Partners, which bought a stake for £31m in 2015. It is understood the change in control was enacted to separate Ovo, which also includes prepay specialist Boost Energy, from the rest of Fitzpatrick’s interests, but the low-key nature of the move could raise further questions over the level of transparency from a company upon which millions of people rely for an essential service. Imagination’s latest accounts showed that in 2021 it notched up £4.5bn of revenues and profits of £377m – a one-off gain as the firm cashed in £422m of energy contracts. The results were in stark contrast with the previous three years, during which more than £300m of losses were racked up. Since its inception in 2009, Imagination has posted annual pre-tax profits four times and losses nine times, with £402m of cumulative profits and £406.6m in losses. Royalties paid from Ovo to Imagination were £21m in 2021, and Ovo then owed Imagination £15m. More recently, the government has handed Ovo and its competitors funds to cut bills after the Ukraine war pushed up costs, following pleas by Fitzpatrick and peers for state intervention. As Ovo runs the rule over Shell Energy, some are worried about its capacity to digest another large supplier. Ovo already has 13.3% of Britain’s domestic electricity market and 11.2% of the gas market. Adding Shell would give it market shares of about 18% and 16% respectively. “Transparency and accountability are so important in energy after the chaos caused by so many suppliers going bust,” says Simon Francis, coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition. “Many were private companies where the public had little visibility of their financial performance. This highlights the risk of concentrating control of many customers with one supplier, as we saw with Bulb. If Ovo does buy Shell Energy’s customers, more control will be in the hands of one supplier, reducing choice and potentially adding even more risk to Britain’s already broken energy system.” Ovo faces another challenge: customers of the SSE Energy Services (SES) brand will be moved under the Ovo tag by January 2024 when a brand licence agreement ends. Customers will hope the transition is smooth after recently ranking SES the worst energy supplier. Last week, Ovo Energy and Good Energy were ordered to pay £4m after overcharging thousands of households on their bills by breaching the energy price cap. On the runway Despite his ever-growing energy empire, one of Fitzpatrick’s main focuses in recent years has been Vertical Aerospace, the flying taxis firm he created in 2016. He has an office at the top of a block on Notting Hill Gate, near Ovo’s London home and Kensington Roof Gardens, but Vertical is primarily run out of Bristol, its shares are traded in New York and it is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Vertical hopes to revolutionise the world of travel, allowing short trips in light aircraft with eight propellers and a cruise speed of 150mph. As its name suggests, they would be able to take off vertically and land in confined spaces in cities. Vertical aims to get its VX4 model into service by 2025. The company received a £14m grant from the UK’s publicly funded Aerospace Technology Institute this year. It even has the backing of Branson: in 2021 his Virgin Atlantic took out an option to buy 150 VX4s, aiming to provide a UK network of Virgin-branded taxis. Fitzpatrick said the deal “unites two entrepreneurial organisations who share the same passion for innovation and best-in-class partnerships”. But despite the hype, the company has been one of several UK businesses to suffer amid the US tech rout. Vertical floated with a valuation of $2.2bn, swelling Fitzpatrick’s paper fortune by about $800m. But the stock is down more than 80% since its debut in late 2021. Fitzpatrick has witnessed his near 70% stake crumble by about $500m, and the company is now valued at just over $400m (£320m). Electric flying taxis have long been touted as a neat solution for solving traffic problems in gridlocked cities looking to cut their carbon footprint and pollution. However, doubts over their feasibility have weighed on investors’ nerves, despite a order book of about 1,400 aircraft. The company has likened its difficulties to the doubts around Tesla in its early days, and hopes more customers will follow American Airlines in agreeing to make pre-delivery payments for aircraft to ensure priority orders. It has said as “an early-stage company with a history of losses, we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses in the foreseeable future”. Software glitches In line with several energy upstarts, Fitzpatrick has long tried to cultivate an image of Ovo as more of a digital enterprise than a traditional energy supplier. One senior industry executive says he has always hoped “to position Ovo as a tech company and himself the leader of a new generation of energy companies. He seems monomaniacal [in that mission]”. In 2019, he formed a “grid technology” business, Kaluza, within Ovo, offering software handling tasks ranging from billing to smart electric vehicle charging. It lists Nissan, EDF and BP among its customers. But reality has yet to match the ambition. Bosses at the platform, which is named after German mathematician Theodor Kaluza and has now been spun out of Ovo, kicked off talks for a new round of funding late last year, but no fresh funds have been announced. Accounts show it made a loss of £14.6m in 2021. Auditors at PwC said the firm was reliant on Ovo for funding and warned over uncertainties around wholesale energy prices and the cost of living crisis. Fitzpatrick also launched a remote-working software business aimed at helping organisations prioritise their workloads. He founded Just3Things with Kim Atherton, who was the chief people officer at Ovo, in 2018, spinning out the app in 2020 as the pandemic spurred a surge in remote working. Just3Things has been quietly mothballed, and Atherton’s LinkedIn page says she left it in December. She is now an occupational psychologist and declined to comment. Then there is the rum brand, Duppy Share, that Fitzpatrick has invested in alongside ex-footballer Ian Wright and rapper Kano. There is also Akili Partners, a management consultancy dissolved this year; as at the end of 2021, Akili owed Imagination a loan of £941,000. Another interest, Imagination Industries Incubator, owed £9.8m in loans to its parent, Imagination Industries, in 2021. When will the party start? None of this appears to have deterred Fitzpatrick from his latest racy project. He took a 15-year lease on Kensington Roof Gardens in the early months of the pandemic, in July 2020, and there is speculation it will relaunch this summer. The striking venue opened in 1938 and has Grade II-listed status. Plans submitted to the council show Fitzpatrick wants to attract chefs from around the globe to four new restaurants but also create the “antithesis of an ostentatious Mayfair private members’ club”. Kensington Roof Gardens is owned by Imagination and accounts show it provided a £3.75m loan to the gardens in 2021, with an interest charge of £139,000. At the end of that year, the venture owed £4.3m. The Mail on Sunday reported that local residents have resisted plans for parties until 3am and complained that guests may be able to peer into their properties from the gardens. Fitzpatrick will hope that, when the champagne cork finally pops on its opening, his other ventures have not already left him nursing a hangover."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T06:56:45Z","webTitle":"Wednesday briefing: Why the nuclear fusion breakthrough doesn’t mean we’re in energy utopia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/14/first-edition-nuclear-fusion","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. You may know nuclear fusion as the power source for Iron Man’s suit, or the basis of the Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor that powers the, er, flux capacitor in Back to the Future. (If so, please stop reading, this is not a newsletter for nerds.) Yesterday, after the news was initially reported by the Financial Times, Joe Biden’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, confirmed a scientific breakthrough at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that’s a very long way from a superhero exoskeleton or a souped-up DeLorean: for the first time, a fusion reaction has produced more energy than it takes in. Which sounds miles better than a time machine, to be honest. Granholm called it “one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century”. In theory, nuclear fusion reactors could one day be a plentiful source of power without any associated carbon emissions or radioactive waste. Climate crisis solved, and we can all get back to obsessing over Harry and Meghan on Netflix instead. Disappointingly, though, it isn’t anything like that simple. Today’s Grinch-like (but also very interesting!) newsletter, with Dr Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London, is about the long distance from a remarkable breakthrough to an energy utopia – and why fusion won’t help us get to net zero. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Asylum | Rishi Sunak has insisted he can clear a backlog of nearly 100,000 asylum claims by the end of next year as part of a five-point plan that includes changes to the law that will criminalise and then remove tens of thousands of people who claimed asylum after travelling to the UK by small boats. Strikes | The standoff between UK ministers, bosses and unions over pay showed no sign of reaching resolution on the first day of four weeks of planned industrial action. Rishi Sunak said that the government would not shift its position on pay ahead of another day of disrupted trains on Wednesday. Strep A | The cost of antibiotics used to strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK in recent weeks, pharmacists have said, with many facing continued difficulties in sourcing supplies. Since mid-September there had been 60 deaths from invasive strep A infections in England, including 13 children. Plastics | Single-use plastic items including cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups are reportedly to be banned in England by the UK government after a consultation. Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, is poised to unveil plans to phase out the items and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. Media | Harry &amp; Meghan, Netflix’s documentary series about Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, racked up more viewing time on the streaming service than any other documentary during its first week, the company said. More than 28m households watched at least part of the series. In depth: ‘Predicting the future is difficult – there are huge hurdles to overcome’ Before we get into the reservations, Dr Michael Bluck wants to be clear about something: the success of the US government’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California in producing a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the first time is remarkable. “This is a very impressive scientific achievement – it’s a really, really hard thing to do,” he said. Ever since the 1950s, scientists have sought to realise the theoretical promise of the same reaction that occurs in the core of the sun. But the old joke about fusion suggests how difficult that has been: it is always, always 30 years away. “These are very bright people doing amazing things,” Bluck said. “It is a sort of holy grail.” *** What is nuclear fusion? Whereas nuclear fission – the process at work in conventional nuclear power plants – generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium, fusion works the other way round. A thermonuclear reaction fuses light elements like hydrogen into heavier ones like helium, thereby generating more energy than it takes to produce. (Nicola Davis explains this in more detail.) That process is known as “ignition”. Beyond the obvious virtue of a net energy yield, “It’s low carbon, it offers baseload [that is, consistent] energy unlike renewables at the moment, and you don’t have to worry about it melting down or producing nuclear waste to the same extent,” Bluck said. “It’s a great vision.” *** What does this announcement mean? There are two approaches to nuclear fusion: call them doughnuts v lasers. Magnetic confinement is the more common and longstanding method: picture, if you can, a doughnut-shaped machine, with nuclear fuel inside it kept afloat by magnetic fields and heated to incredible temperatures while the reaction takes place. The NIF is one of a smaller number of facilities trying something different: inertial confinement. In the pithy summary of White House science chief, Arati Prabhakar, yesterday: “They shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel [hydrogen plasma] and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers.” The pellet, encased in diamond, sits in a tiny gold cylinder. By hitting it with 192 giant lasers for less than 100 trillionths of a second at more than 3 million celsius, scientists at NIF succeeded in producing 3 megajoules of energy from the 2.05 megajoules it took to make the reaction happen. But as good as that sounds, there are very significant barriers to further progress. “It’s important to say that this is not trying to be a fusion reactor, it’s simply trying to make fusion happen,” said Bluck. “But it lacks almost everything that you need to make a viable reactor. “So, OK, the energy put in has resulted in a larger amount of energy coming out – but the big caveat is that it depends where you draw your perimeter: powering the lasers themselves required way more energy. You have to draw a slightly artificial dotted line around the vessel to say there’s been a gain.” The lasers may emit 2.05 megajoules, but they took about 500 megajoules of energy to power, though defenders of the experiment say that they are not optimally efficient and can be significantly improved. “There’s also the fact that you would need the reaction to happen much more often,” he went on. At the moment, the NIF manages it about ten times a week. “You need it many times a second.” As well as all that, the energy produced in the NIF experiment is in the form of “high speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating – none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We’ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.” That’s very difficult to do without overheating the lasers that make the reaction happen in the first place. “And that programme of work has not even been thought about yet.” Magnetic confinement – the doughnut option – may not have reached the more-out-than-in milestone yet. “But they have been thinking about the real world stuff for many years. They’ve sort of” – you can hear the pain of this simplification in Bluck’s voice as he speaks – “solved the physics issues, and now they’re looking squarely at the engineering issues.” *** So does this news mean nuclear fusion plants are closer? Again, sort of: something with a proven concept is closer than something without one. (Arthur Turrell argues for the importance of that step.) Yesterday, Jennifer Granholm said that Joe Biden had set a target of “a commercial fusion reactor within 10 years”. What’s possible? “Predicting the future is difficult,” allowed Bluck. “But I think I’m being optimistic in saying 50 years for inertial confinement being in practical use – it’s between 50 years and never. There are huge hurdles to overcome.” Kim Budil of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that “a few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant”. Could magnetic confinement work sooner? “I think that’s ambitious, too,” said Bluck. “A demonstrator by 2050 – OK, that could be possible. But that doesn’t mean it’s cost effective to scale up.” *** But can it help reach net zero? Some advocates of fusion would say that Bluck is being too pessimistic – but even in best case scenarios, it is hard to see fusion as a useful part of the changes needed to make net zero a reality. It is cumulative emissions that matter to avoiding the worst impact of the climate crisis, and so even if fusion plants are online at scale by 2050, that is too late. Nonetheless, investors in fusion – like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel – are persuaded of its revolutionary potential. “There is a degree of utopian zeal,” said Bluck. “You’re not a billionaire worthy of the name unless you’re investing in ambitious devices. What it will mean for getting to net zero by 2050 is realistically nothing. I do worry sometimes that it can suck the air out of other more viable solutions.” *** So is there any point in pursuing fusion power? Absolutely! For one thing, Bluck might be wrong: “There might be that significant step forwards that changes things suddenly. But we should be careful not to overestimate that possibility.” Still, nuclear fusion doesn’t have to be about solving the climate crisis to be worthwhile. The more realistic role for fusion, Thomas Nicholas writes in this 2019 piece for the Conversation, is “as an energy source in a post carbon society”. And so long as it doesn’t become an excuse for ignoring the urgency of the only realistic solution to the climate crisis, a rapid transition to renewables, it’s not like it presents much competition for funding: the total investment in private companies working on fusion ever is about $4.8bn, the Fusion Industry Association says. In comparison, clean energy investment in 2022 totalled $1.4tn, of which $472bn went on renewable power. “None of this means fusion doesn’t have potential,” Bluck said. “But you have to be able to say what you’re going to do in between.” Pondering the holy grail, he added: “I don’t think they ever found it, did they?” What else we’ve been reading Andrew Gregory and Denis Campbell spent 33 hours in an NHS hospital, and their findings unveiled just how deep the crisis in the health service has gotten.

A trove of documents obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws shows nervous officials warned the foreign minister of “significant” risks if Australia went to the gathering in Vienna shortly after last year’s election. Those risks included that “Australia’s attendance could be misinterpreted as a first step” in actually joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which is opposed by the United States and other nuclear weapons states. Despite Anthony Albanese championing the treaty prior to forming government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also issued a general warning that joining the agreement “could carry risks for our strategic interests”. The relatively new treaty imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. It now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and is strongly backed by neighbours such as Indonesia and New Zealand. Australia has not yet taken steps to join the treaty, and continues to consider its position. The Labor party committed to sign and ratify the treaty after considering a range of factors that appear to be high hurdles to pass. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But anti-nuclear weapons campaigners were heartened by the decision to send government backbencher Susan Templeman to the Vienna meeting in June. Australia followed that up by shifting its position at a UN committee in October to “abstain” after five years of actively opposing the treaty under the Coalition. The newly released documents show Dfat formally recommended against sending an observer to the first meeting of TPNW members. Officials conceded that attending would “attract praise from its proponents” and “may help to offset criticism … about Australia’s commitment to the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime”. “However, in light of the ALP’s pre-election position on TPNW, Australia’s attendance as an observer could be misinterpreted as a first step in acceding to the treaty,” the submission to Wong in June said. The department added that if the minister decided to send an observer anyway, “a concerted diplomatic effort will be required to mitigate the risks” and to “minimise the significance of the decision” to attend. Wong circled “not agreed” to the main recommendation and asked for further advice about the impact of sending a backbench MP. Dfat then provided a new submission saying that if Australia was the only country to send a parliamentarian as an observer “we will need to manage potential perceptions” and “shape the narrative”. “Public messaging will be necessary in light of strong domestic and international interest,” it said in an attached strategy document. “Key to any messaging … will be to highlight that no decision has been made on our broader approach to the Treaty.” Gem Romuld, the Australian director of the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said it was “time for Australia to dispense with the dangerous, outdated notion that nuclear weapons bring security”. “It’s clear that certain officials at the foreign ministry are intent on maintaining the previous government’s unprincipled position on this treaty,” Romuld said. “We’re pleased that minister Wong has insisted on taking a new direction.” Labor’s national platform in 2021 included conditions for supporting the treaty, including working for universal support and effective verification and enforcement. Wong’s spokesperson said the government was “engaging constructively to identify realistic pathways for nuclear disarmament” and that was why the minister had signed off on Templeman’s attendance as an observer. “The government will consider the TPNW systematically and methodically as a part of our ambitious agenda to advance nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament,” the spokesperson said. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the TPNW “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. That was a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. Wong’s spokesperson said there were “a number of complex issues to be considered” and Australia would “engage closely with our international partners – including the United States – as part of this process”. “The government has reaffirmed that the US alliance remains central to Australia’s national security and strategic policy,” the spokesperson said. The documents also reveal Dfat officials warned in August against uniting with other countries to sign a statement of concern about the humanitarian impacts of nuclear weapons. The submission to Wong said: “While this might provide an opportunity to counter the narrative that concern for humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons must equate to support for the TPNW, the statement includes wording that nuclear weapons are never to be used again, ‘under any circumstances’. It is unbalanced.” Dfat argued Australia had “already affirmed our deep concern at the humanitarian impact of weapons use”. In that case, Wong approved the official recommendation. But Romuld said the statement was “a factual acknowledgement of the undeniably devastating humanitarian consequences of any nuclear weapons use, backed by over 140 governments and the International Committee of the Red Cross”. Australian officials continue to emphasise the importance of the longstanding Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Another document shows Australia’s goals for the NPT review conference in New York in August included “to provide reassurances that Aukus partners are steadfast in their commitment to the global non-proliferation regime and will set the highest possible standards in our acquisition of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2023/aug/03/nintendo-jumps-1bn-profits-powered-super-mario-film","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-03T15:48:06Z","webTitle":"Nintendo jumps to £1bn profits powered by Super Mario film","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/03/nintendo-jumps-1bn-profits-powered-super-mario-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2023/aug/03/nintendo-jumps-1bn-profits-powered-super-mario-film","fields":{"bodyText":"The success of The Super Mario Bros Movie and the new Zelda video game helped to boost Nintendo’s bottom line on Thursday as the Japanese gaming company reported an 82% increase in profits. It said its operating profit in the three months to 30 June rose to 185.4bn yen (£1bn), with the April release of the film – currently the biggest box office hit of 2023 – driving sales of Super Mario titles and the latest Legend of Zelda game also doing well. Nintendo, which also makes the Switch console, said hardware sales had risen as a result, increasing nearly 14% over last year to 3.9m units. The results underscore Nintendo’s success in extending the life of the long-running Switch system, which has sold almost 130m units, and using its roster of popular characters to boost revenue beyond the core gaming business. Sales in its business related to mobile games and intellectual property tripled to 31.8bn yen owing to the success of the Mario movie, Nintendo said. The market is focused on the timing of a potential successor for the hybrid home-portable Switch, which has received incremental updates including a handheld-only version but is now in its seventh year on the market. Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy, said: “I think they’re going to ride out this fiscal year and squeeze the last bit of juice out of this system and then establish excitement for the new hardware sometime next year.” The Kyoto-based gaming firm maintained its full-year forecast for the console of 15m units, which would be a 16.5% decline on a year earlier. This year Nintendo’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, said the Switch target was “not a goal that we will be able to achieve easily”. Nintendo said it sold 18.5m units of the new Zelda game, Tears of the Kingdom, in the first quarter. The game has a score of 96 out of 100 on the reviews aggregator Metacritic, indicating universal acclaim. The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe game was boosted by the film, recording sales of nearly 1.7m units, pushing total sales to 55.5m units."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2023/mar/21/a-compassionate-spy-review-nuclear-ted-hall","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-21T11:00:53Z","webTitle":"A Compassionate Spy review – love story of scientist who tried to stop nuclear war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/21/a-compassionate-spy-review-nuclear-ted-hall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/mar/21/a-compassionate-spy-review-nuclear-ted-hall","fields":{"bodyText":"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, due in July, is sure to fit its eponymous physicist out with dutiful misgivings on the atomic weaponry front. But this engrossing documentary by Hoop Dreams’ Steve James tells the story of someone who actually did something about it: Ted Hall, who confessed in 1998 – a year before his death – to having passed nuclear secrets to the Soviets while working on the Manhattan project. Recruited as an 18-year-old Harvard genius, he came to feel that a US monopoly on the bomb would threaten global stability and the future of humanity. A sensitive college boy and nascent communist who chafed against wearing military uniform at Los Alamos, Hall gave priceless schematics to Uncle Joe via his beatnik friend, the excellently named Saville Sax, who was the one who actually stepped inside the Soviet consulate. James gets inside the fulminating, jingoistic wartime US ambience through dramatic recreations of college trysts and FBI shakedowns, as well as Hall’s final interviews – notably the CNN spot in which he eventually came clean. But it’s anchoring this all in testimony from Hall’s now elderly wife, Joan, that gives A Compassionate Spy a passionate payload, making it as much a love story as a political chronicle. “A nonconformist, keeping clear of everyone else’s nonconformity,” is how she sums him up. “Did I forget to say he was beautiful?” Joan Hall emerges here as forthright and defiant – where her husband, later dubbed “the quiet American”, was self-effacing. Maybe it’s because of the 52-year period she had to keep stumm, jettisoning her own political activities as the FBI took an interest in the couple. One topic of conversation as the Los Alamos scientists were waiting for the Trinity test was apparently whether marriage would survive as an institution, but the Halls themselves seem to have upped the odds. She provided the steel to their operation, insisting that Ted hold his silence at crucial junctures, including when the CIA appeared to offer an olive branch. At times she crosses a prideful line, especially in the mental gymnastics needed to justify trading with the blatantly homicidal Russian dictator, or in her indignation over the subsequent arms race given her husband’s role in accelerating it. As the Halls’ idealism caused them to chew over such compromises at the dinner table, James’s sleek telling excels at intertwining the personal and the political with illuminating detail. Not least the revelation that what ultimately may have deflected attention from them is that Hall’s brother, Edward, developed the intercontinental ballistic missile destined to be carrying the payloads; it may have ultimately too damaging to the US nuclear programme if the FBI’s dirt-digging covered its leading missile scientist in muck too. One detail omitted here, though, is that Hall died of renal cancer, no doubt as a result of handling plutonium, but not before delivering some stark warnings about arms proliferation and the dangers of a potentially fascist America with its finger on the button. Both seem frighteningly close to coming to pass, though perhaps we also need to think about Hall’s ethos about sharing technological breakthroughs with respect to AI and China, too. This first-rate portrait gets intimate with an atomic-age Edward Snowden, all the better to cast a long shadow. • A Compassionate Spy is at Bertha DocHouse from 24 March."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-19T03:51:14Z","webTitle":"Daniel Andrews denies power is centralised in his office after Ibac investigation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/19/victoria-premier-daniel-andrews-office-ibac-investigation","fields":{"bodyText":"Daniel Andrews has denied power is centralised in his office, after an anti-corruption inquiry found a $1.2m contract was awarded to a union due to pressure applied by Victorian government advisers. The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission investigation into the contract, released on Wednesday, found staff in the health minister’s and premier’s private office “improperly influenced” health department officials to award a training contract to the Health Workers Union. The investigation, dubbed Operation Daintree, does not make any findings of corruption against Andrews, health ministers Jill Hennessy and Jenny Mikakos, or staff working in their offices. Ibac also made no findings of wrongdoing by the HWU’s secretary, Diana Asmar. But Ibac made a damning assessment of the “increasing influence of ministerial advisers and the centralisation of power in the PPO”. Both Hennessy and Mikakos, who were interviewed along with the premier by Ibac, told the commission they were concerned of the growing power within the premier’s office, with latter describing it as “having its tentacles everywhere”. After the report was tabled in parliament Andrews held a press conference with deputy premier, Jacinta Allan, in which he denied power had been centralised in his office. “I don’t accept that at all,” the premier said. “The notion that somehow the premier’s office today is a vastly different one to what it used to be in the past and it used to be some sort of timid outfit – no, that is just not right. “I wouldn’t expect integrity agencies who run very sweeping and broad commentary to have any appreciation whatsoever of what occurred in previous Labor or Liberal governments.” He said his staff worked “together” with their counterparts in ministerial offices to “get things done”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Andrews said neither Hennessy nor Mikakos raised concerns with him during their time in parliament. They resigned in 2021 and 2020, respectively. “[They were] not comments that were ever made to me, [they were] not concerns that were ever raised to me in thousands of interactions with the two people you’ve just cited over 20 years, and in fact, longer,” Andrews said. He repeatedly noted that there were “no adverse findings against anyone” in the report, which he described as “educational” in nature. “The staff members that are referred to in this report do not work for the government any more and have not worked for the government for years, and … the two ministers who are referenced in the report are not even members of the parliament any longer,” Andrews said. Opposition leader, John Pesutto, called on the premier to resign in the wake of the report. “The premier has been in power for more than eight years. How many more reports and corruption scandals do we need before the premier understands that he is the problem?” he said. “In the interests of Victorians, Daniel Andrews must now seriously consider whether he can tackle the corruption he’s allowed to flourish or whether it’s time for him to hand over to somebody who can. “Because you can’t be the problem and also be the solution.” Andrews did acknowledge “the recommendations do go to a number of serious matters”. He confirmed he would lead the process of considering the 17 recommendations, though he had reservations about one that would allow advisers to be called before parliamentary committees. “Staff don’t necessarily sign up to be part of a political debate and be ‘on the field’, as it were,” Andrews said. Ibac also reiterated previous recommendations, which integrity experts have repeatedly called for, including the maintenance of a lobbying register and the publication of ministerial diaries, which is currently in place in NSW and Queensland. It also wants the definition of “lobbyist” to be expanded to ensure it captures anyone engaged in “any contact with government representatives that is calculated to influence government and parliamentary functions”. The Victorian Greens’ acting leader, Tim Read, said the report had “laid bare the need to bring our integrity standards up to scratch”. “This means requiring detailed diaries of ministers and parliamentary secretaries to be made public … so Victorians can see who is influencing government decisions,” he said. “We must also legislate codes of conduct for lobbyists, ministers and their staff and strengthen them to require clearer information on potential conflicts of interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T11:19:51Z","webTitle":"Persian power, Pinochet protests and postwar punks and princes – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/28/persian-power-pinochet-protests-postwar-punks-and-princes-the-week-in-art","fields":{"bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Luxury and Power The struggle for power between ancient Greece and the Persian empire, seen in a radical new light. • British Museum, London, from 4 May to 13 August.

Luckily for me, writers have frequently turned to Dorset for their inspiration. Chief of these of course is Thomas Hardy. He stamped his personality over his idea of Wessex, reviving an ancient kingdom, and giving towns and villages new names. Dorset was the focus for Hardy’s imagination and his presence is everywhere – in museums, bookshops, on blue plaques. Every town seems to have been a film set for a Hardy adaptation. In a somewhat overliteral move, his heart is buried at Stinsford, just east of Dorchester. But there are many more writers worth exploring, all with their own visions. You might begin a literary tour of Dorset in its north-east, on Cranborne Chase, the chalkland that borders Hampshire and Wiltshire. Now an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, it is marked by the traces of ancient earthworks and shaped by its designation as forest – for hunting – which held until the early 19th century. WH Hudson chose a house just over the border in Hampshire’s most westerly village, Martin, when he was writing A Shepherd’s Life, first published in 1910. Originally from Argentina, Hudson described Cranborne Chase’s downlands and wildlife, and also the rural people he met on his travels. He wrote that he hoped that by committing them to paper he might lay to rest the ghosts of his imagination. Children’s author Angela McAllister once lived in Hudson’s cottage and told me that a century after his death devotees still make their way to his old home, entranced by his singular vision. Also on Cranborne Chase, in the village of Long Crichel, is the beautiful, recently restored St Mary’s Church. The adjoining rectory was once the scene of what the biographer Simon Fenwick described as England’s last literary salon, where writers, musicians, artists and even Greta Garbo stayed. This extraordinary roll call – which included Nancy Mitford, Benjamin Britten, EM Forster, Vita Sackville-West, Cecil Beaton and Evelyn Waugh – sometimes gave rise to a complex web of personal relationships. But the house was also where, in the midst of 1950s anti-gay hysteria, the seeds of change were planted, when two of the wider Crichel group, Michael Pitt Rivers and Lord Montagu, were convicted of homosexual acts and imprisoned. This led to the Wolfenden report and a change in the law, making the small village an important site in LGBTQ+ history. Beyond Shaftesbury – which Hardy renamed Shaston, and where he had the unfortunate Sue throw herself from a window in Jude the Obscure – is Blackmore Vale. This is a hidden, little-known place, a patchwork of fields for cattle, punctuated by villages and small towns. William Barnes (1801-1886) was born in the village of Bagber, and spent his life as schoolmaster, clergyman and dialect poet, becoming, as fellow poet Edward Thomas described him, “the mouthpiece of the Dorset carters, cowmen, mowers and harvesters”. While Vaughan Williams set some of Barnes’s poetry to music and he was highly praised by WH Auden, he remained neglected until relatively recently. But in her recent verse novel Orlam, the two-times twice winner of the Mercury prize winning musician PJ Harvey, born and raised in Bridport, west Dorset, used Barnes’s dialect to describe a year in the life of a girl on the brink of adulthood, with translations into standard English on the facing page. Not far from Bagber, but decades later, Douglas Adams used his experience of seeing a cottage being demolished in his home town of Stalbridge as inspiration for the opening chapters of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Dorset’s west is marked by the intimate, hilly landscapes of the Marshwood Vale, looked over by Dorset’s (possibly mythical) Saint Wite, from her shrine at the magnificent church at Whitchurch Canonicorum, also the burial place of Georgi Markov, the dissident Bulgarian writer killed by a ricin pellet delivered by the point of an umbrella on Waterloo Bridge in 1978. There’s an air of espionage here – the Marshwood Vale is also the supposed setting for the drama in Geoffrey Household’s spy thriller Rogue Male, in which the hero, on the run after attempting to assassinate a European dictator, buries himself in a holloway to escape his pursuers. The writers Robert Macfarlane and Dan Richards, along with the artist Stanley Donwood, came in search of this place for their book Holloway, but disguised the location, as Household had done. The maze of shady lanes farther east, under the huge Eggardon hill (mentioned in Andrew Young’s poem A Prehistoric Camp) drew the broadcaster Kenneth Allsop to settle in West Milton in the 1960s. Here he wrote a series of newspaper columns, gathered together as In the Country, detailing in rich prose his life here – his passage on how difficult it was to obtain good Dorset Blue Vinny cheese oozes desperate enthusiasm. But he was also a conservationist, calling for a rebalance with nature and defending his patch against insensitive development. Close to Bovington Camp is isolated Clouds Hill, the house where the archaeologist, writer and soldier TE Lawrence made his last home before he died in a motorcycle accident in 1935. Now under the care of the National Trust, it’s an extraordinary place to visit, where Lawrence’s spirit is palpable. This complex character, enigmatic and enormously well connected, entertained many literary friends in the upstairs sitting room, although he was often on less good terms with his military colleagues. More flamboyantly countercultural was the literary set that sprang up in the small, pretty village of Chaldon Herring, between Weymouth and the Isle of Purbeck. This included the extraordinary Powys family: Llewelyn, John Cowper, Theodore (who fictionalised Chaldon Herring in his allegorical novel Mr Weston’s Good Wine), Philippa, Gertrude and their assorted friends and lovers. Most prominent was Sylvia Townsend Warner and her partner, the poet Valentine Ackland. The two women were energetically left wing; Townsend Warner’s feminism found its greatest expression in her brilliant novel Lolly Willowes, in which the heroine, after many years of numbing tedium in London, finds escape and a new life among witches in the countryside. Townsend Warner and Ackland are both buried at Chaldon Herring, this and the charming pub the Sailors Return make it well worth a visit. Dorset’s east is the conurbation of Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch, all teeming with cultural life. Mary Shelley is buried in Bournemouth, as is her husband Percy’s heart (probably). Although Mary’s original resting place was to be St Pancras churchyard, her son realised that this plot would soon become disrupted by the new railway line. Stranger still was Frederick Rolfe, the self-styled Baron Corvo, author of the cult novel Hadrian the Seventh, who came to Christchurch in 1899. Impecunious and slightly deluded, he made his home in the town for a few years, and attended the Catholic church. It was originally thought that he had created Renaissance-style frescoes of the archangel Michael on the church wall by photographing models leaping in mid-air, making lantern slides from the results, and projecting them on to the walls to trace their outlines. But it seems that this was not his work, which is a pity as it’s a good story. Threading one’s way back past Poole and its harbour, Canford school is a short (and fascinating) walk from the ancient town of Wimborne Minster. The Booker prize-winning writer Alan Hollinghurst was educated here, as was Derek Jarman, who wrote in his memoir Dancing Ledge about being driven in his art teacher’s Rolls-Royce to Poole’s demolition sites, where they would scavenge for debris – a decorated door by Jarman is on display at Poole Museum. Dorset, though, is no literary tomb – the county continues to exert its influence on writers and their books. In her debut novel The Whalebone Theatre, a 2022 bestseller, Joanna Quinn created a family and an imaginary grand house, Chilcombe, navigating the crises and opportunities of the early decades of the 20th century, and in doing so reimagined coastal Dorset. She was following a noble tradition. When Hardy created his Wessex it was as a “partly real, partly dream” land – Dorset, but not Dorset. And that’s what writers seem always to have done: they have shaped Dorset for their writing, but the place has shaped them, too. The land lies in the stories; the stories lie also in the land.

When he was a boy, in the 1950s, he witnessed explosive shells – launched from the Chinese mainland two miles away – falling on his birthplace. As he explains: “479,000 rounds were fired in 44 days. We lived in fear.” Little did Wu Tseng-dong know then, but the People’s Liberation Army was supplying him with the raw material for his future livelihood: today he makes knives from those shells to sell to tourists from the mainland. Reporter Jane Corbin’s gripping analysis of rising tensions between the People’s Republic of China (capital: Beijing; leader: Xi Jinping; population: 1.4 billion) and the Republic of China (capital: Taipei; current leader: Tsai Ing-wen; population: 23 million) examines the possibility of history not just repeating itself, but of tensions escalating so far as to cause the return to geopolitical discourse of that quaint old term, nuclear Armageddon. In this scenario, Beijing bombards not just the little island of Kinmen (slightly bigger than Bute), but Taiwan itself (roughly the size of Switzerland), in order to reunify China. But it thereby embroils the US, provoking a worldwide conflict that would, so far as I understand it, depress global economic growth predictions even more than the coronavirus pandemic. Certainly, the Taiwanese people whom Corbin interviews are preparing for the worst case scenario. Ever since democratic Ukraine was invaded this time last year by an authoritarian superpower, the numbers of Taiwanese people paying to train at private military camps has risen exponentially, compulsory military service has been increased from four to 12 months, and Taipei’s “porcupine strategy” now involves stocking up on anti-air, anti-tank and anti-ship weapons so that a smaller force can frustrate a larger (Chinese forces are 12 times bigger than Taiwan’s, Corbin tells us) in line with Kyiv’s example. Tsai Ing-wen’s two-term presidency, which comes to an end later this year, is predicated on retaining Taiwanese democracy in the face of Beijing’s offer of reunification under an approach of “one country, two systems”. That principle which, as the relatively recent crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong demonstrated so clearly, means nothing in practice. But, will Beijing really invade Taiwan? Astutely, Corbin interviews Frank Huang of Powerchip Technology Corp, one of the many Taiwanese companies that makes the island the world centre for computer chips. Of the world’s advanced superconductors, 90% are made here. “Your car, your refrigerator, your PC – without Taiwan, it won’t work,” says Huang. Huang’s corollary? China dare not invade, since any war would threaten to destroy this most valuable of industries, whose lucrative secrets Beijing covets. This is perhaps true, but China and the US are working hard to develop their own superconductor industries. Taiwanese partners are working with US firms in Arizona to achieve just this. Beijing, Corbin reports, is using spies to uncover Taiwan’s superconductor secrets so it can manufacture its own, but, she estimates, Taiwan will remain a world leader in this vital industry for the next 10 years. Plus, any invasion is estimated to cost China trillions of dollars. Instead, war is being fought in the grey zone of cyberspace rather than on battlefields. Cyber hacking expert Puma Shen, of Doublethink Lab, estimates Taiwan is hit by 12m cyber-attacks a month. The country is subject to more disinformation than Twitter and Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social combined. Taiwan’s first transgender government minister, Audrey Tang, a former hacker turned minister of digital affairs, says disinformation has included homophobic fake news suggesting that Taiwan’s mooted same-sex marriage legislation would result in droves of HIV patients arriving from the rest of the world bent on receiving free treatment. Untrue, Tang says. But, as we in the west know from our own masters of post-truth politics, Trump and Johnson, little lies soon grow long legs. Sadly, Corbin couldn’t get face time with president Xi to set out his Taiwanese policy. Instead, she has the wonderful Victor Gao, fluent yet chilling media spokesperson for the Chinese Communist party. Gao only needs a stroked cat on his lap to truly perfect his Bond villain aura, as he tells Corbin: “The future of Taiwan will never be decided by the 23 million people of Taiwan themselves. The future of Taiwan will be decided by the more than 1.4 billion on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” The implication is clear: the rest of the world would do well to keep out of this domestic affair. Happily, history tells us, if nothing else, the world won’t listen to his advice. • Inside Taiwan: Standing Up to China was on BBC Two and is on iPlayer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/27/nuclear-power-station-sizewell-c-water-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T14:17:41Z","webTitle":"A new nuclear power station needs a vast supply of water. But where will Sizewell C get it from? | Will Atkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/27/nuclear-power-station-sizewell-c-water-suffolk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/27/nuclear-power-station-sizewell-c-water-suffolk","fields":{"bodyText":"Last week, the government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear power station to be developed on the Suffolk coast. Providing low-carbon electricity for about 6m homes, Sizewell C will stand alongside two existing stations, Sizewell B and the decommissioned Sizewell A. I live close enough to see the 60-metre tall, white dome of Sizewell B almost every day. When I want to torture myself, I look at developer EDF’s “construction phase visualisations” of the 1,380-acre building site, with its towering spoil heaps and forest of cranes, and wonder if this is what it will take to save the planet. What might not have been immediately obvious in the coverage of the government’s decision was that the Planning Inspectorate, tasked with assessing such projects, had recommended that permission be refused. The problem, the examiners explained, was fairly simple: EDF couldn’t say exactly where it would obtain one of the main substances needed to make a nuclear power station work, that substance being water. As well as uranium, a reactor of the kind EDF plans to build needs water in very great volumes. Saltwater will do for part of the process, which is one reason why nuclear power stations are usually built beside the sea. But fresh or “potable” water will also be needed – first, to cool the two reactors, and then, just as importantly, to cool the irradiated fuel once it has been removed from the reactors. For this, absolutely pure water is essential. Sizewell B uses about 800,000 litres of potable water per day; Sizewell C, with its twin reactors, will need more than 2m litres per day, and as much as 3.5m litres per day during construction. Last September, during the closing hearings of the six-month public planning examination, the question of just where the developer was going to get the water to run Sizewell C, let alone build it, was becoming urgent. Those who had raised concerns about precisely this issue more than 10 years earlier would have been forgiven for feeling frustrated. As one of the driest parts of the country, Suffolk is described by the Environment Agency as “seriously water stressed”. By 2043, eight years into Sizewell C’s 60-year operating life, the agency anticipates a water deficit in the county of more than 7m litres a day. Northumbrian Water, which operates locally as Essex and Suffolk Water, had made it clear to EDF that there was not enough local groundwater for either construction or operation. EDF’s plan, therefore, was to build a pipeline to bring water from the River Waveney, 18 miles away on the Norfolk border. During at least the first two years of construction, while the pipeline was being built, EDF planned to install a temporary desalination plant on the site to turn saltwater from the sea into fresh. Then, in August, the water company broke the news that its abstraction licenses dictating how much water it could extract from the Waveney, granted by the Environment Agency, were likely to be reduced by up to 60% to safeguard downstream levels. It subsequently confirmed that the Waveney did not, after all, have the capacity to supply water for for any of the 10-year construction phase. Desalination, opponents of the project noted, was a solution EDF itself had discounted in January 2021 “due to concerns with power consumption, sustainability, cost and wastewater discharge”. And yet, desalination, with all the problems it had set out (including discharging millions of litres a day of saline concentrate and phosphorus into the North Sea), remains EDF’s “fallback” solution for running the station, as well as building it, if another source can’t be found. Northumbrian Water has since confirmed that: “Existing water resources (including the River Waveney) will not be sufficient to meet forecast mains water demand, including the operational demand of Sizewell C.” For his part, the secretary of state, Kwasi Kwarteng, has a “reasonable level of certainty” that 2m litres of water a day will be found from elsewhere by the time the reactors are ready to be switched on. Perhaps, as Northumbrian Water has suggested, by piping it in from Essex (though Essex isn’t overburdened with water); or by reducing household wastage; or by reusing effluent. It will be for the Environment Agency, the Water Services Regulation Authority, Natural England and the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure that everything is done properly at such time as a water source – some kind of source – is settled upon. The more I look at those mock-ups of the building site, the more they seem like a metaphor for another kind of despoilment. Given the government’s stated intention to build a fleet of new nuclear power stations across the country, it’s not just people who live in Suffolk who have reason to wonder what the secretary of state’s decision to wash his hands of Sizewell C’s water problem says about the resilience of the systems we entrust with safeguarding our environment. Still, the foundations will be laid, I suppose, and the cranes will rise, and after 10 years and £20bn (by EDF’s reckoning), Sizewell C will be built. And when the time comes for its reactors to go critical, there will be water, because if there isn’t, Suffolk will have a new tourist attraction to rival Framlingham Castle: the most expensive white elephant in human history. What this fait accompli means for Suffolk’s rivers and seawater, let alone for the county’s householders and farmers, are not questions that will be answered before building begins. It’s enlightening, in this context, to consider that the past six months have been the driest in Suffolk for more than a quarter of a century, and the driest in England since 1976. “The secretary of state disagrees with the examining authority’s conclusions on this matter,” Wednesday’s decision letter states, “and considers that the uncertainty over the permanent water supply strategy is not a barrier to granting consent to the proposed development.” During last year’s planning hearings, two stories kept coming back to me: the biblical account of Moses in the desert, making water gush from a rock by striking it with his staff; and the Brothers Grimm tale in which a giant clasps a stone in his fist, and crushes it until, finally, water is forced out. • William Atkins is the author of The Immeasurable World: Journeys in Desert Places and The Moor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/22/australian-military-looks-to-build-crucial-space-capabilities-that-will-support-aukus-nuclear-subs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-22T14:00:29Z","webTitle":"Australian military looks to build crucial space capabilities that will support Aukus nuclear subs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/22/australian-military-looks-to-build-crucial-space-capabilities-that-will-support-aukus-nuclear-subs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/22/australian-military-looks-to-build-crucial-space-capabilities-that-will-support-aukus-nuclear-subs","fields":{"bodyText":"Defence is looking for a mesh of military space satellites that can talk to each other as well as to the ground, and is “scalable, rapidly deployable and reconstitutable”. The system, in other words, would need to be able to be made bigger, to be quickly put into action and to be repaired in case of attack or accident. The military network could include the ability to track high-velocity projectiles and the use of infrared, would need to be “resilient to cyber and electronic warfare attacks”, and would need to transmit and receive data from assets “at any global position”. The defence department has issued a request for information, saying it is looking for “progressive and innovative ideas” for a space-based data transport and relay network (DTRN). “The DTRN is envisioned to be a flexible and configurable global converged network in space, drawing on multiple security domains to disseminate defence data,” the request said. “It should be resilient, enabling secure and rapid transmission and reception of multiple digital data types through an open systems architecture of satellite and ground assets using commercial military frequencies. “The DTRN would be operated for military purpose and should be scalable, rapidly deployable and reconstitutable.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Aukus submarines have been dominating defence-related conversations recently, because of the enormous $368bn price tag and concerns that the first Australia-made nuclear submarine will not be ready until the 2040s. Meanwhile, Guardian Australia has spoken to people in the space industry who feel the other parts of Aukus – the so-called “pillar two” – are being overlooked. Pillar two includes artificial intelligence, drones, cyber capabilities and other technologies, all of which use space-based assets and many of which are likely to be realities years before the submarines. Satellites, and therefore space, are critical for surveillance, navigation, weapons guidance and communication already, and will become more so in the future. Defence projects already under way include Def799 for space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and JP9102 for satellite communications systems. A senior defence strategy and capability analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Malcolm Davis, said while space was critical for Aukus’s pillar two, it would also be crucial for pillar one, in terms of communicating with submarines. “If you go down the laser optical route [instead of low frequency radio] you get voice, internet, the works. Satellites and space are going to be important for comms,” he said. “They also open up avenues for anti-submarine warfare, using light detecting and ranging (Lidar). “In pillar two, in terms of countering hypersonic threats, in terms of autonomous systems, space is crucial to all of that.” The Space Industry Association of Australia has argued that Aukus should be used to bolster space capabilities through technology and infrastructure sharing. The partners should build new constellations of satellites to reduce their dependency on existing technology, thereby minimising the impact of military attacks on satellites, the association’s then director of operations, Philip Citowicki, wrote in a 2022 piece for the Australian National University’s National Security College. He argued that a loss of access to space, or the destruction of space-based assets, would have “catastrophic effects”, but the Aukus partners could work together to reduce the risks. Guardian Australia has asked the defence minister, Richard Marles, if Australia needs to do more on space defence. Davis warned that China, particularly, has offensive space capabilities. He paraphrased a quote from British army commander Bernard Montgomery, who said “if we lose the war in the air, we lose the war and we lose it quickly”. “The same might be said of space, we lose the war and we lose it quickly,” Davis said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T12:41:15Z","webTitle":"Christopher Nolan recreated nuclear explosion without CGI for new film ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/dec/13/christopher-nolan-recreated-nuclear-explosion-without-cgi-for-new-film-oppenheimer","fields":{"bodyText":"Christopher Nolan has spoken of the challenges of showing an atomic explosion without resorting to computer-generated imagery for his new film, Oppenheimer. The director’s forthcoming biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, one of the pioneers of nuclear weapons during the second world war, involves a scene recreating the first atomic detonation in New Mexico in July 1945, a month before the US dropped similar bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, hastening the end of the conflict. “Recreating the Trinity test without the use of computer graphics was a huge challenge to take on,” Nolan told Total Film. “Andrew Jackson – my visual effects supervisor, I got him on board early on — was looking at how we could do a lot of the visual elements of the film practically, from representing quantum dynamics and quantum physics to the Trinity test itself … there were huge practical challenges.” Nolan has long pioneered ambitious technical film-making while also mounting real-life stunts of considerable scale. He blew up a real Boeing 747 for 2020’s Tenet, flipped a truck for The Dark Knight and shot on top of melting glacier in Interstellar.

I’d ticked off more than 90 of the 105 miles, almost all in dazzling spring sunshine. Such luck with the weather was encouraging complacency. But up high, any hubris is ripe for a humbling. And the mountain gods were beginning to conspire. The first hint of trouble came when I recognised the two fellow hikers coming the other way. In Tré-le-Champ, way below, we had drunk coffee at neighbouring tables and, realising we were on the same route, resolved to move on to beer when we saw each other again at the next refuge, La Flégère. So when I saw them marching back to the village, I stopped, assumed a quizzical face and asked: Est-ce la bonne direction? The second concern was that they were babbling, with eyes wide and urgent. Just an hour ago they had seemed calm and able to speak reasonable English. The third thing was the phrase one of them kept repeating: J’avais peur de mourir! I don’t speak much French, but this seemed a matter of mortal import. An hour after deciding against following them down, I understood. The weather had become awful and, with my hood pulled low, I almost walked into a wall of rock. After a step back, I saw that progress demanded the ascent of three ladders, bolted into the cliff face but rusting under fierce elemental assault. Moving between the ladders required traversing metal platforms, each five feet long and the width of a walking boot. The guidebook had insisted the climb was no bother. Perhaps in fair weather. Just then the wind was lending a shoulder to the rain and battering every inch of my Gore-Tex. A man was coming down the other way, practising an incantation: “Three points contact, three points contact.” After an age he landed and sized me up while tucking loose straps into my bag. We spoke a little and he reassured me we had similar experience levels. Move one limb at a time and you’ll be fine, he said. All the rungs are stable and even. I knelt, breathed deep, and tied my laces in a double bow. Halfway up, I started saying it: “Three points contact, three points contact.” I heaved a leg, then an arm, a leg, then an arm. After an eternity – there were more ladders beyond the first three – I hauled myself over the top. My heart rate was 170 beats a minute. This was the last-but-one day of an eight-day trek over high mountains and not once had it gone above 160. The ladders were the last serious trial of a demanding itinerary. The route weaves across the mountaintop borders of France, Italy and Switzerland, with a total ascent exceeding the elevation of Mount Everest. More than once I had sympathy with middle-aged men, beached and breathless on top of a peak. Sleeping was a different challenge: nights were spent either wedged between snoring hippos in dorms or freezing under canvas. Still, the scenery makes up for everything. On Mont Blanc, all is in motion. In the purest, most exact morning light, I stood for hours looking at exposed shelves, tracing my eye over the waves, remains of when the peaks were formed. As Robert Macfarlane puts it in Mountains of the Mind, these landscapes can make one marvel at the forces necessary to knead sandstone. This is a world “where granite slops about like porridge, basalt bubbles like stew, and layers of limestone are folded as easily as blankets”. These are sublime sights: the height, light and power send volts through the soul. The thrills are constant and, after a time, there is a risk of overstimulation, of senses being singed. On the saddle of yet another wondrous col, the dizzied mind can turn inwards to the comfort of drudgery. The present can fade. The real genius of the trail, though, is that whenever it senses indifference, it takes umbrage and shakes you back to life. The ladders excepted, it does this with pleasure, not peril. Outside Rifugio Bonatti in Italy’s Aosta valley I collapsed on a bank. It had been a long, hot climb out of Courmayeur with an appalling hangover and, as I closed my eyes, I pined for the comfort of a double bed. Then, as the breeze lifted the sweat from my neck, I looked across the valley to the mountain ridge just as the sun was waving goodbye. The Grandes Jorasses looked so close I felt I could run my hands down the runnels. A lime green butterfly pecked at the nectar of a violet flower, then floated on to rust-coloured blueberry bushes. That evening, I stepped outside into the cold and saw, sitting snug in the blue relief of the mountain silhouette, the stars of the plough. My mind simply couldn’t be anywhere else. After the trek, I delayed reality with one of Bluerise’s yoga retreats in Les Houches, just outside Chamonix. I thought it would be the perfect way to recover. It did exactly as I’d hoped, with great company and wonderful food complementing the perfect amount of exercise. But I soon realised the yoga would also help train that elusive feeling of presence. After the daily morning flow session on the deck, we sat wrapped in blankets and looked out at the mountains, felt the soft sun, watched our breath rise and fall. If there was mist, it wouldn’t last; the wind would lift a flap from the sky and there it would be, Mont Blanc, cloaked in silver snow. In those moments, I was rapt. After years of my attention span dwindling, it was bliss to welcome some back. Living solely in the present is wonderful. It is also an indulgence. Sometimes the future demands notice. On one of the guided walks around the Chamonix valley we heard a rumble and saw a puff of dust, evidence of a rockfall. Our guide said there were now more than ever. The permafrost, which acts as cement for the rocks high up, is melting. Even mountains – totemic, everlasting mountains – are vulnerable to climate change. How to do it The classic route is to start in Les Houches, progressing anticlockwise in a circle back to Les Houches. But some prefer to start elsewhere, or to tackle it clockwise. Where to stay The style and price of mountain refuges varies across countries, but most give a hearty alpine meal, breakfast and a bed in a dorm for about €60. The best place to book is montourdumontblanc.com, but most of the best refuges – Rifugio Bonnatti and Rifugio Elisabetta particularly – will be booked up well in advance. I brought my tent and stayed on campsites half the time. One should be wary of wild camping in Switzerland though – it’s strictly interdit. Yoga The Bluerise Yoga and Hiking retreat costs £1,485 for a week, including accommodation, all food and yoga classes.

America’s elite, he observed, forms a “compact social and psychological entity” that “towers over the underlying population of clerks and wage earners” and whose “values” are “differentiated” from those of the “lower classes”. “All their sons and daughters,” he added, “go to college, often after private schools; then they marry one another… After they are well married, they come to possess, to occupy, to decide.” Seven decades later, the British political scientist Matthew Goodwin similarly paints, in his new book Values, Voice and Virtue, a picture of “the new elite” in Britain. The brushstrokes are familiar, drawing on the work of communitarian and “post-liberal” thinkers of recent years. Britain has “a new dominant class” that has captured its institutions and imposes its “radically progressive cultural values” on the rest of the nation, adrift as it is from the conservative instincts of the majority. In its details, it’s a portrait that Mills would recognise. “Their very identity as high-flying, highly accomplished graduates of elite institutions,” Goodwin observes, “gives them a profoundly important and highly collective sense of unity” and “shapes their values and collective loyalties”. This sense of collective identity is “strengthened by their social networks, which are usually filled with other elite graduates from other elite universities. More often than not, people from the new graduate elite marry other members of the graduate elite.” That there are such echoes across the decades should not surprise us. The image of a distinct, new elite, defined by its education and values, and standing over the common people, has a long history, popping up throughout the 20th century. The roots of the contemporary debate about the new elite lie in the 1970s. The late Barbara Ehrenreich published with her husband, John, an essay in 1977 in which they coined the term “professional-managerial class” (PMC). There had developed, they argued, a new class of college-educated professionals, from engineers and middle managers to social workers and culture producers, that was distinct from the middle class of old but essential to the functioning of capitalism. The Ehrenreichs were hopeful that this class could be mobilised for progressive causes. They warned, however, that it could also give rise to “what may at first sight seem to be a contradiction in terms: anti-working class radicalism”. And that, many on the left have argued in recent years, is just what has happened. One of the most uncompromising analyses of “anti-working class radicalism” came in the American academic Catherine Liu’s acerbic tract, Virtue Hoarders. Drawing on the Ehrenreichs’ work, Liu argues that the PMC, ensconced in universities and thinktanks and NGOs, has turned into an elite that “finds in its particular tastes and cultural proclivities the justification for its unshakable sense of superiority to ordinary working-class people”; one that “prefers obscurantism, balkanization, and management of interest groups to a transformative reimagining of the social order”. They are “virtue hoarders” because of their desire to accumulate virtue as a means of enhancing self-worth. And they are in many ways synonymous with Goodwin’s “new elite”. Liu’s portrait of the PMC is far more astringent and over-the-top than anything Goodwin has produced. Yet, it is also more realistic. Liu does not pretend that the virtue hoarders constitute a new ruling class. As a supporter of Bernie Sanders, what provokes her ire is that they stand in the way of real social change, having abandoned class politics for what she calls “performative transgression”. And where Goodwin argues that the “radical woke” capture of society lies at “the roots of today’s more turbulent politics”, Liu understands that the new elite is the product, not the cause, of political turbulence, the consequence of the evisceration of mass movements for social change. For Goodwin, though, the new elite are the “people who really run Britain”, having largely displaced the old ruling class of “upper-class aristocrats, landowners and industrialists”. The idea that Gary Lineker or the US-based British journalist Mehdi Hasan or Sam Freedman, a fellow at the Institute for Government thinktank (all of whom Goodwin has namechecked as key members of the new elite) shape our lives more than Rishi Sunak or Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England is, to put it politely, stretching credulity. Similarly, the suggestion that those who have been responsible for austerity, anti-trade union laws and the imposition of real-terms wage cuts on nurses and railway workers are not the ones who really have power over our lives is bafflingly myopic. It exposes the postliberal concern for the working class as being as performative as the antiracism of the “new elite”. It is true that a new generation of thinkers and activists has helped consolidate a culture more given to identitarian thinking and more censorious in its outlook (though also one that is less racist, more accepting of women’s equality and more welcoming of gay people). To confuse that, however, with the claim that it constitutes the new ruling class is to have a weak understanding of how power works and where it lies. Liberals in the media, thinktanks and universities certainly help shape the national conversation. But, again, the issue is not nearly as straightforward as Goodwin suggests. He points to studies showing that most journalists are left wing. Yet, the media coverage of, and national conversation about, say, “stop the boats” policy or the Rwanda scheme has hardly been “left wing”. On the contrary, language once confined to the far right is now casually exploited by mainstream commentators. One could plausibly argue that someone like Goodwin himself shapes public debate more than most of the “new elite” to whom he points. A decade ago, Goodwin warned of voters being pulled in a reactionary direction by “a toxic and – to be frank – nasty group of opinion-makers in our society who appear to relish sowing the seeds of xenophobia, protest and division”, through their exploitation of the immigration issue. Today, Goodwin welcomes the Rwanda deportation scheme and advises the Tories to raise “the salience of cultural issues”. In that shift we can see how too great an obsession with the “new elite”, and too little acknowledgment of the real sources of social and economic power, creates a pull towards a form of politics that the earlier Goodwin would have recognised as “toxic”. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The outage meant mission control lost command, telemetry and voice communications with the station in orbit. The power outage hit as upgrade work was under way in the building at Houston’s Johnson Space Center. The crew was notified of the problem through Russian communication systems, within 20 minutes of the outage. Space station program manager Joel Montalbano said neither the astronauts nor station were ever in any danger and that backup control systems took over to restore normal communications within 90 minutes. “It wasn’t an issue on board. That was purely a ground problem,” he said. “At no time was the crew or the vehicle in any danger.” “We knew this work was going on, and in preparation for that we have the backup command and control system that we would use if we have to close the centre for weather emergency, especially important during the hurricane season,” he said. It is the first time Nasa has had to fire up these backup systems to take control, according to Montalbano. He said Nasa hoped to resolve the issue and be back to normal operations by the end of the day. Nasa maintains a backup control centre miles from Houston in the event of a disaster requiring evacuations. But in Tuesday’s case, the flight controllers stayed at mission control since the lights and air-conditioning still worked. “We’ll better understand what happened and then take lessons learned and move forward,” Montalbano said. The tensions between the US and Russia on Earth do not prevent their respective space agencies from working together, although Moscow has said it will withdraw from the ISS after 2024 and build its own station instead. In February, Moscow launched a rescue vessel to the ISS to bring home three crew stranded after their original capsule was hit by a meteoroid. Last year, cosmonauts arrived at the ISS wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, colours that match the Ukrainian flag, shortly after Russia’s invasion began. The message, if any was intended, was unclear. Months later, Russia’s space agency published photos appearing to show cosmonauts on the ISS holding the flags of the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk.

That over-excited claim was prompted by hopes that nuclear fusion – the process triggered in an uncontrolled manner in hydrogen bombs – would soon be harnessed for power generation. In the type of nuclear power we have today, disintegration of radioactive atoms such as uranium produces heat but also a troublesome legacy of radioactive waste that will stay active for millennia. Fusion power plants would instead generate energy using the same process that powers the sun: fusing of the dense nuclei of hydrogen atoms, releasing some of the formidable energy held in the atomic nucleus, with only helium as the byproduct, and without the pollution. Today the allure of fusion energy lies not so much in its price as its almost negligible carbon emissions, and therefore its potential to save us from the ravages of global heating. But will it arrive in time to stop the planet frying? There are plenty of uncertainties and unknowns around fusion energy, but on this question we can be clear. Since what we do about carbon emissions in the next two or three decades is likely to determine whether the planet gets just uncomfortably or catastrophically warmer by the end of the century, then the answer is no: fusion won’t come to our rescue. But if we can somehow scramble through the coming decades with makeshift ways of keeping a lid on global heating, there’s good reason to think that in the second half of the century fusion power plants will gradually help rebalance the energy economy. Perhaps it’s this wish for a quick fix that drives some of the hype with which advances in fusion science and technology are plagued. Take the announcement last December of a “major breakthrough” by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The NIF team reported that, in their efforts to develop a somewhat unorthodox form of fusion called inertial confinement fusion (ICF), they had produced more energy in their reaction chamber than they had put in to get the fusion process under way. Problem solved? Sadly not. As NIF scientists readily admitted, the energy generated by super-intense laser needed to spark fusion was less than a hundredth of the total amount of energy consumed by the lasers themselves. So they still have to do about a hundred times better to break even. And that’s even before factoring in the energy losses in converting the heat created by fusion into electricity. What’s more, the hi-tech pellets containing special forms of hydrogen used as fuel each cost more than $100,000, whereas a working ICF reactor would need to burn up 10 pellets a second at a cost of less than $1 each. ICF has so far been little studied as a source of energy anyway; NIF’s principal mission is to study nuclear reactions in order to help maintain the US stockpile of atomic weapons. Most work on fusion energy uses a different approach called magnetic confinement, in which the fuel – at temperatures of around a hundred million degrees, several times hotter than the centre of the sun and fiery enough to melt any material instantly – is suspended by magnetic fields, typically in a large doughnut-shaped chamber called a tokamak. Making and operating such a device raises eye-watering engineering challenges, with which fusion scientists and technicians have been grappling for decades. Many current hopes are pinned on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) being built in southern France. As the name suggests, Iter won’t be a power plant – it is strictly an experimental facility, its goal being to solve some of the engineering problems so that we can work out what a commercial fusion plant should look like. The construction of Iter’s massive tokamak started in 2013 (the project itself began in 1988) – but the facility is already way over budget (the current estimated cost is €20bn) and behind schedule. When a further delay in Iter was announced in January – it might not switch on until 2035 or so – some cynics wheeled out the old saw that fusion is perpetually just 20 years away. But such setbacks are to be expected when you consider the magnitude of what’s being attempted: to make a piece of a star on Earth. Not all of the fusion eggs are in this one basket. The EU is planning a smaller prototype plant called Demo. Another, called Sparc, is now being built in Massachusetts in a collaboration between MIT and the private fusion company Commonwealth Fusion Systems. China, Japan and Russia have their own plans, and there are several dozen private companies worldwide with ambitious goals. All the same, most fusion experts believe we’ll be lucky to have a prototype plant producing a net gain by 2040, and it’s unlikely that fusion energy will be going into the grid in significant amounts before 2050. When fusion start-ups announce that they’ll have a working reactor generating power within a decade, it’s a message for investors, not a realistic promise. These companies will have their part to play – not as the plucky underdogs who crack the problem but as providers of parts and expertise in the fusion industrial ecosystem. All the same, some researchers worry that over-promising could foster complacency that stymies investment in the urgently needed stopgap alternatives to fossil fuels, such as renewables and nuclear fission. The Soviet fusion pioneer Lev Artsimovich once said that humankind would have fusion energy “when society needs it”. In one sense he was sadly mistaken: we needed it years ago, before the lethal heatwaves, the wildfires, the shrinking ice caps. But it’s not too much to hope that we will have it before we make the planet uninhabitable, and that it can eventually turn the climate crisis into a catastrophe averted. Cynicism about fusion is cheap, but the progress is undeniable, and even exciting – so long as we keep it in perspective.
