We’ll be back tomorrow for the women’s final between Ons Jabeur and the unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, and Daniel will be your guide for Novak Djokovic v Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. A tantalising weekend menu. Have a lovely evening – good night! I’m told that Alcaraz will be the youngest male Wimbledon singles finalist since his compatriot Rafa Nadal in 2006, who was just a month younger. This was the moment he made it: Novak has a way with words! So we have the long-predicted and tennis-dream final between the king and young pretender. The all-round best of all-time against the best 20-year old McEnroe has ever seen. The complete game and the grass court master against a firework forehand and brilliant drop shot, energy, youth and a quick, quick learner who has improved hugely through the fortnight. Where’s your money? Now we’re back to Claire and Tim in the studio. Over to Tim in his smart tie: “Some people have a good feel at the net but not a very good technique, but Alcaraz has it all. He has very good geometry. Lots of players these days are one-dimensional, but he has it all.” “He’s just so complete, mentally, physically and technically.” McEnroe’s report: “Medvedev looked resigned at some points. He did make a subtle adjustment, got back into it a couple of times but Alcaraz was able to remain relaxed and stay in control. It is unheard of that we have five breaks in a row at this level.” “Clearly the French Open affected him [Alcaraz]. The second set there was one of the best sets of tennis I’ve ever seen but then suddenly it was all over. I’m not sure why he had the cramp there but I’m sure his camp will have worked with him.” Medvedev disappears quickly off court with a smile and a wave and the stage belongs to Alcaraz “A dream for me, and to play a final here at Wimbledon, I can’t believe it. Its an amazing moment for me and time to keep dreaming! “He’s [Medvedev] is an amazing fighter and I had to be my best and play aggressive, be myself all the time, that was the key to serve the match. “Everybody knows it is going to be very difficult but I will fight, that is myself, I will believe in myself that I can beat him here. It will be tough time for me, I dream since I started playing tennis to play a final here, It is a final, it is no time to be afraid, to be tired, I will go for it.” And he quietly packs up his bag and prepares to leave. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 6-3 Medvedev From 15 all, Medvedev hits cross court into the tramlines, then Alcaraz is beaten. Alcaraz smiles before he serves and it is a beauty which Medvedev can only hit wildly out. And what a finish! After a superb rally, Medvedev comes up to the net to volley but Alcaraz prowls like a tiger and whips a cross court return with a kiss of the racket! He holds his hands to the sky in celebration. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 5-3 Medvedev * I’d like to see Medvedev as Jo’s love interest in Little Women, Professor Bhaer. But perhaps thats just me. From 30-30, Medvedev goes long and then Alcaraz pulls out a killer forehand return. Another break! And Alcaraz serves for the match. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 4-3 Medvedev An hors’ doeuvre of variety shots as Alcaraz fluff a volley between his legs and can’t get his racket out of the way when Medvedev approaches the net with an excocet. Alcaraz hits long to secure the break again. There’s life in this old dog yet! Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 4-2 Medvedev * Alcaraz isn’t keen on losing momentum in this match and has two break points. But Medvedez isn’t done yet and holds on in two epic baseline rallies to bring it back to deuce. He double faults to give Alcaraz advantage, saves another break point with an ace, hits a half volley into the net and then survives a fourth break point with a one-legged wild volley into an empty court. But the fifth break point does for him as Alcaraz breaks back straight away. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-2 Medvedev A changing wind suddenly blows over Centre Court as Medvedev breaks the Alcaraz serve with a mixture of inspirational shots and Alcaraz falling just fractionally off his game. Now he’s in the set, might he just dare to step towards the baseline? Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-1 Medvedev* A huge roar as Medvedev beats Alcaraz with a deep smash right into the corner, then aces. A big first serve makes it 40-0 –Alcaraz pulls back -but that’s a bobby-dazzler as he comes to the net and fires the ball like a bullet into the grass and even a flying Alcaraz can’t reach it. He’s on the board in the third set. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-0 Medvedev Some fallibility in the world No. 1 as he double faults to make it 30-30 but a deft volley wins one point, and Medvedev hits the next serve out. As they change ends, Medvedev sits on his chair and chats away with amused resignation – not sure who he’s talking to, perhaps just one of those conversations we all have with ourselves on one of those days. But up he gets to serve 3-0 down. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 2-0 Medvedev* A brilliant drop shot by Alcaraz to go 30-15 up on Medvedev’s serve. A double fault for 15-40 and the body language of his box wouldn’t inspire confidence in Mr Happy. A brilliant first serve by Medvedev but Alcaraz can better it. Medvedev’s serve is broken in the very first game of the third set. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 1-0 Medvedev These games are flying past so quickly. Medvedev has crept forward slightly to receive serve but there isn’t much he can do about such precision. Alcaraz wins to love and the spectators look at each other in awe. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 Medvedev * Alcaraz is like a ballet dancer, so incredibly balanced and strong. Suddenly its 40-0 and Alcaraz has three set points. Two big Medvedev serves pull it back to 40-30 but Medvedev can’t cope with the deep return of his second serve and that’s the set! We get the fist pump. And Medvedev, looking altogether like a university professor who has lost his notes, stares aimlessly into space. *Alcaraz 6-3 5-3 Medvedev We’ve got new balls. And Alcaraz bounces them, and bounces again. Suddenly its 40-0 with a series of clinical serves and another and that’s the game. McEnroe says Medvedev’s tactic of standing so far back isn’t working. Alcaraz 6-3 4-3 Medvedev* In five Wimbledon appearances , this is Medvedev’s first semi-final, and he’s got a tricky opponent to experiment on. But he doesn’t help himself by missing a smash to go 0-15 down on his serve. After much to-ing and fro-ing he holds with a whipping forehand. *Alcaraz 6-3 4-2 Medvedev In the change of ends, Alcaraz munches on something that looks like cooking chocolate, and both drink from their reusable bottles. In the shirts battle, it is Lacoste v Nike . A brilliant drop volley gives Alcaraz the first point, which a sprinting Medvedev can’t’ reach. Is he going to shuffle forward towards the net at any point? Alcaraz wins to love. Alcaraz 6-3 3-2 Medvedev* Easy service game win to Medvedev, who even comes up to the net with a dinky volley to make it 40-0 and collects the final point when Alcaraz’s return is out. *Alcaraz 6-3 3-1 Medvedev Medvedev continuing to receive serve somewhere south of the Falkland Islands, and Alcaraz makes the most of it with dreamy delicacy. But Medvedev pulls back with a two-handed backhand return to make it 30-30. Alcaraz snatches a base-line rally to make it 40-30; and another to go 3-1 up. Easy pickings in only his fourth grass-court tournament! Alcaraz 6-3 2-1 Medvedev * A mega rally at 15-0 finishes when Medvedev hits long. Two more errors from Medvedev hands Alcaraz two break points. But he can’t make the most of them and soon its deuce. Some brilliant volleying in kissing distance of the net hands Alcaraz another break point and he pounces on a second serve to take early advantage in the set. Lots of slow motion fist shaking from his box. *Alcaraz 6-3 1-1 Medvedev Alcaraz, neat and tidy in the way that some people just are, no ink stains on his school shirt, plays a drop shot like a butterfly wing but just brushes it into the net to give Medvedev the hint of a chance. Then a double fault as his serve becomes suddenly fallible to give Medvedev a break point. Retorts with an ace. Then Medvedev returns the next serve into the net. A high class rally ends when Alcaraz bunny hops the game into the net. Two drop shots work to give Alcaraz the game. Alcaraz 6-3 0-1 Medvedev * Thanks Daniel, get well soon! Medvedev, looking sweaty under the roof, makes a good start to the second set holding to love, and with a lucky net cord to boot. And with that, my watch is over; here’s Tanya Aldred to croon you through the rest of this match. thanks all for your company and comments – sorry I couldn’t use them all – and enjoy the weekend. Shabbat shalom, and go in peace. *Alcaraz 6-3 Medvedev I don’t know, what was Medvedev thinking with that drop? It’s like when Rafa Benitez decided to play mind games with Alex Ferguson. Anyway, Alcaraz is quickly at 30-0, Medvedev then sends a return long, and when the same thing happens again, that’s enough for set one! Medvedev is, as we know, rather good, but Alcaraz is better and it’s hard to see how that differential is equalised. “Re the thread about empty seats,” says Susannah Clements. “We were there on Monday – queue for the ladies between matches was insane. Plus 20 minutes queuing for drinks. Then you have to wait for a break in games to get back in. It took over 45 minutes from rushing for the exit, to settling back in my seat with a drink. Don’t judge those empty seats too harshly!” Alcaraz 5-3 Medvedev* Alcaraz makes 0-15 but Medvedev is soon at 30-15, an ace down the middle doing the business. But another serve, into a similar area, is returned with interest, a forehand lopping cross-court onto the line, and when Medvedev tries a drop of his own, Alcaraz is onto it like a hyena, flipping a pick-up over the net for break point … converted when a half-courter invites the backhand into the tootsies! Alcaraz breaks, and will now serve for the first set. *Alcaraz 4-3 Medvedev My browser crashes, returning in time for me to hear Andrew Castle marvelling as how much Alcaraz’s backhand slice has come on this fortnight, as he holds to 15. “Enjoying your commentary, but have to disagree that it’s fine to pop out to the bar between semis and not return in time for the second match,” writes Gillian Forrester. “Incredible and sad to see how many vacant seats there are on Centre Court in the first set of Alcaraz vs Medvedev; very disrespectful to the players and annoying for us who would love to be there.” I don’t think it’s an issue to go for drink and a slash between matches, and see how that can take the best part of half an hour; I also don’t think it’s a big deal to miss the walk-out and knock-up, but yes, once the match is well into its first set, I don’t understand why people wouldn’t want to watch, though they can spend their time how they like once they’ve paid for a ticket. Alcaraz 3-3 Medvedev* Lovely from Alcaraz, the drop-lob combo making 15-all and a punishing forehand down the line 15-30; the world number one is starting to assert himself. But Medvedev gets to 30-all when another weapons-grade forehand hits the net, then challenges, successfully, when Alcaraz strays wide prior to dispensing another winner. A service winner then follows, and that’s a good hold from Medvedev; this is warming up. *Alcaraz 3-2 Medvedev Alcaraz targets the Medvedev forehand but it’s his that breaks down first, a framed shank handing over 0-15. Then, at 15-all, we see the first drop, beautifully played and disguised with Medvedev stranded somewhere in Southfields, before an exocet forehand whistles wide. No matter, another lovely drop raises game point and, you guessed it, a third seals the deal – which makes me wonder whether he can do it too often as that might encourage a change of tactic, and my guess is Alcaraz is happy with the status quo. Alcaraz 2-2 Medvedev* Alcaraz makes 0-15 with a backhand winner but Medvedev quickly does likewise. A service winner follows, then another on the backhand as his opponent makes the net, and the game is sealed with a booming forehand down the line. In comms, Mac reckons Alcaraz looks a bit nervous and that he’s not moving properly yet. *Alcaraz 2-1 Medvedev Medvedev asks a line judge to move along because they’re standing where he likes to return from, but at 15-all Alcaraz catches him again, a slice serve out wide too far away for him to reach – and even if he’d managed, his man was at the net to cut off any return. Still, Medvedev gets to 40-30 then, on the run, spanks a superb flat backhand cross-court for a winner before a net cord delivers him a second deuce. From there, Alcaraz quickly closes out, and neither of these are properly motoring yet. Alcaraz 1-1 Medvedev* Now Medvedev holds easily, to 15, closing out with a leaping backhand. *Alcaraz 1-0 Medvedev A wide delivery to open up and Medvedev, receiving almost in the royal box, can’t get a meaningful racket on it. Alcaraz holds to love. Righto, off we go again – Alcaraz to serve. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but for anyone put off their food by illness as is currently the case with me, peanut butter – Skippy, of course – on toast and salted caramel biscuits, not together but there’s an idea, are preventing me from wasting away. Out come our players, to a sparsely populated Centre Court. Mac isn’t happy that people have left, but it seems reasonable to me that they nip to the bar, and telly schedules won’t allow for a longer break. “Isn’t it a shame that a player can lose because he fails to act as his own line judge?” wonders Phil Haran. “If a mistake is made it should be automatically corrected by playing a let or awarding the correct point. I’ve seen more ‘missed’ line calls than ever but the technology is there to correct it.” Yeah, I think this is a fair question: you’d think the technology exists for a quick beep to signal in or out as with foot faults – and if it doesn’t I’m sure it won’t be long – in which case I agree, the ability to see whether a ball is in or out is not what we’re seeking to measure here. Coming up next: Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Daniil Medvedev [3]. It’s not a bad old life. Djokovic has now made 35 Grand Slam finals, which is another record – it’s previous holder was Chris Evert. Djokovic is on for five in a row, a calendar year grand slam, and who knows how many more majors. He’s playing better than ever, and explains that it was a hard match, the scoreline not reflecting the reality of what went down on the court. Sinner might’ve won the breaker but let him in with a few loose shots, though he’s proved himself a leader of the next generation and is a very good player. “It’s great to be part of this new generation, I love it,” he says, and would like to believe he’s playing better than ever. In an individual sport, you need to be in the best possible physical, mental and emotional state, not seeing his age as a “hindrance” – “36 is the new 26” – and wants to give back to the sport everything it’s given to him, his family and his team by playing as long as he can. Asked about the “hindrance” situation, he says the call might’ve changed the game and he had to regroup; he didn’t think it was an issue and usually he doesn’t extend his grunts, so there might’ve been an echo off the roof or something. He’ll now enjoy the second semi from his massage table, and it’s just unbelievable how brilliant and brilliantly articulate he is. It’s going to take something unfathomably brilliant to stop him. Sinner nets, and Djokovic has won a 45th straight match on Centre Court! It’s just totally ridiculous how incredible he is because sinner is a fine player who played well, and yet he didn’t even get close. as the man himself said, there are those who are good, who want to supplant him, but “it ain’t happening”. Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 (4-6) Djokovic Now it’s Djokovic who slips, as sinner dematerialises a forehand winner for 4-4; Sinner approaches the net to check he’s OK while, in comms, Todd Woodbridge gives us an Aussie metaphor for being flat on one’s face as Djokovic is, “like a lizard drinking”. And, well, Sinner nets a backhand, then another, and Djokovic has two match points… Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 (3-2) Djokovic Now then. Djokovic has something in his eye, but he’s still struggling to see the backhand return Sinner sends past him, punishing a second serve to secure an immediate mini-break. He cements it with a service winner and looks good, but as we know, lots of people do until suddenly they don’t and, as I type that, a double restores order. Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 Djokovic* Djokovic goes wide for 15-all, so retorts with an ace, but when sinner changes the direction of the next rally with a cunning backhand down the line, his squash shot drops long; 30-all. But the last thing Djokovic needs is help, and he sort of gets it, landing a serve on the sideline – he aimed for it – and the ball dies – he didn’t expect it to. A forehand winner follows, and that means we’ll have a tiebreak, Djokovic’s uncanny ability to win these increasing of late – at the French he was six from six, without a single unforced error. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-5 Djokovic An ace gives Sinner 40-15 and a forehand into the corner guarantees him a breaker; he’s played his best tennis in this set, though he also played some good stuff in the third. In comms, they think Djokovic is annoyed with the crowd, supporting sinner partly because they want a contest and partly because they don’t love him, showing displeasure then repurposing it as fuel. He’ll now serve to stay in the set. Sinner 3-6 4-6 5-5 Djokovic* I remember watching Wimbledon years ago and Connors, coming to the end of his career, was losing. “Come on Jimmy!” shouted someone from the crowd – because of course they liked him once he started losing, as was the case with Martina and Steffi too – and he replied “I’m trying!” That feels like where Sinner is now, but then he lands a huge forehand return for 15-30 … after which Djokovic swipes a forehand wide! Is God fallible? Is there a glitch in the matrix? Two set points for Sinner! Djokovic serves a fault then takes a moment as the umpire asks for quiet, and the way this match has gone, as ace down the T will soon be upon us. But no, instead Sinner goes long then, after landing a return onto the line, has a chance at a forehand, inside court, and with loads at which to aim! But he goes wide with it, and as he contemplates deuce will know that he’s not made the most of that opportunity because, for what feels like the first time, Djokovic didn’t confiscate it from him. And that’ll hurt Sinner even more than watching the aces go by, all the more so when he accelerates through deuce to secure yet another hold. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 5-4 Djokovic Er, Jannik Sinner for one. He races to 40-0, then Djokovic creams a gorgeous return down the line as Sinner comes in – which he does behind his next serve too, his volley too good. I can’t overstate this point: Sinner is playing and has played well, but he’s still not landed a punch. Sinner 3-6 4-6 4-4 Djokovic* Oooh yeah! A glorious forehand winner down the line gives Sinner 0-15, but a forehand return just misses the baseline – I think. Like Tim, I’m surprised there was no challenge there, all the more so when a serve out wide is good enough for 30-15. Soon after, it’s 4-4, and who’d be surprised if Djokovic broke next game? *Sinner 3-6 4-6 4-3 Djokovic For the first time in a while, Sinner holds to love, but can he tax Djokovic when he serves 90 seconds from now? Sinner 3-6 4-6 3-3 Djokovic* Sinner does more complaining about the slipperiness at change of ends, and he needs to make sure this doesn’t get into his head. It doesn’t seem to be – he smokes a forehand for 15-all, only to then thwack another into the net immediately afterwards. From there, more ridiculous serving finishes off the game, and Sinner is struggling to make an impression in this set, though he’s actually playing pretty well. “Is it too much to ask of an opponent to put up some resistance,” wonders Mohammed Yasser. “Could’ve broke first game but gets broken himself. I’m guessing a reverse of last year is off?” I think that’s harsh, Sinner’s going everything he can, problem being the lad he’s playing is alright at this. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 3-2 Djokovic Djokovic directs Sinner about the court and Sinner obliges, haring from a get in one corner to another in the other, before a drop shot leaves him stranded – though he makes a laudable effort to reach it, sliding like Sol Campbell. Sinner, though, soon plants a forehand onto the line for 30-15 and secures his hold to 30. Sinner 3-6 4-6 2-2 Djokovic* Again, Sinner gets to 30-all on the Djokovic serve, and when he’s handed a second delivery at 30-40 he doesn’t miss out, a leaping backhand return fizzing down the line for a winner and deuce. For all the difference it makes. Djokovic closes out easily, an almost dismissive volley at the net clinching the game while, before the next, Sinner cleans his shoes pointedly, looking at the umpire who he knows will not and cannot intervene. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 2-1 Djokovic Ach, at 0-15, Sinner finds a decent first serve, so Djokovic returns it well then sends a gorgeous backhand slice down the line and curling away, for a clean winner and another example of a shot he’s honed in recent years. More slicing follows, then Sinner nets a backhand and complains to the umpire that the surface is slippery and losing footing on a forehand earlier in the rally. Three break points to Djokovic, who burns the first with an overhit backhand to end the longest rally of the match and loses the second with a colossal ace out wide. Again, credit to Sinner who hasn’t panicked, faded or lost temper – OK, I can’t lie, I’m totally there for him totally losing it – and another booming serve, out wide again, is good enough for deuce. Yet another service winner and another ace follow, and that’s serious behaviour from the youngster. He’s got some work to do snd it won’t be soon, but of the players on tour who’ve yet to win a major, he looks the most likely to at some point. Sinner 3-6 4-6 1-1 Djokovic* I guess Djokovic reminds me a little of Jimmy Anderson, both in terms of his lithe, athletic build, and his total devotion to improvement. For the wobble seam read the serve we’re looking at now, and as I type that, a second-serve ace onto the T underlines the point; he’s having an absolute laugh here, sending another ace out wide as Jelena, his wife, chuckles to herself. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 1-0 Djokovic “He’s weirdly become one of the best servers of all time,” says Calv Betton of Djokovic. “It’s the accuracy.” And the ability to deliver it under pressure. But Sinner’s quite good too, and he holds to 30; it’s worth noting that he’s played well and consistently today, nor has he taken a backward step; he’s just not been able to find a way at the big moments because who is? Sinner 3-6 4-6 Djokovic* An ace down the middle then a service winner; what can you do? Then a serve out wide and a clean-up wrongfooting forehand to the same corner; nothing whatsoever. Sinner does, though, plant a forehand onto the baseline to which Djokovic can’t respond, saving the first of three set points; can you guess what happens next? You can and you can’t: Djokovic does serve an ace, but it’s out wide. He’s such a tease, and he leads by two sets to love appearing to have levels in reserve if he needs them. This is brilliance so natural, expected and understated as to be deeply unsettling. *Sinner 3-6 4-5 Djokovic Sinner’s looking to get to the net now, daring Djokovic to pass him – he’s got to try something new – and quickly makes 40-15. A booming serve and backhand to the corner follow … so Djokovic pastes a backhand winner down the line! Ridiculous behaviour. Sinner, though remains unfazed, another serve-volley point forcing Djokovic to serve for the set. Sinner 3-6 3-5 Djokovic* Sinner will know he’s running out of road in this set – and, therefore, in this match – and with new balls in play, I’d expect him to really go after this game. In a rare case of me being right, that is indeed what happens – he properly attacks Djokovic’s serve, coming to the net early having already hit two shots that’d rally-enders against anyone else. He does make the putaway, but shortly afterwards it’s 40-15 … though Djokovic shouts towards his box when an error gives Sinner a sniff. He’s tossing the ball too far in front, he reckons … so then ends the game with another service winner, and needs just one more for a 2-0 lead. Meantime, Calvin Betton returns on my point that Sinner is holding easily. “Djokovic does that on purpose when he’s a break up. He throws games away so the opponent has no rhythm. It’s risky but works.” *Sinner 3-6 3-4 Djokovic Eeesh, is the pressure and disappointment telling? Down 0-15, Sinner drags a forehand wide – Djokovic has been playing to that flank – then at 15-30, a backhand sails over the tramlines. Sinner, though, is nobody’s expletive, an error from Djokovic preceding a forehand winner down the line for deuce – he’s found first serves when he needs them – and another, followed by an ace, keeps the second set alive. “How can anyone like salad cream but not sandwich spread?” wonders Simon McMahon. “I don’t understand. They’re like Borg and McEnroe. You can’t have one without the other.” I think it’s probably OK in lieu of butter and with another filling, but I’d not enjoy a sandwich that was just bread and it. I’d also be ravenous after scranning it. Sinner 3-6 2-4 Djokovic* Excellent de-fence from Sinner, a squash-shot on the stretch keeping him in the rally before a backhand down the line makes 0-15; Djokovic responds with another service winner. At 30-15, though, Sinner reads a ball into the forehand corner, looping a winner down the line, but then can’t control his response to serve directed out wide to the forehand. No matter, a forehand into the corner facilitates an overhead putaway and once again Djokovic must serve at deuce … but facing a second delivery, though Sinner picks the right backhand return, it’s wide, just, then a superb Djokovic get prompts a forehand error, and another decent situation evaporates. *Sinner 3-6 2-3 Djokovic Sinner is holding easily, apart when he’s broken; Djokovic is holding with aggravation, without being broken. That’s the difference here. Sinner 3-6 1-3 Djokovic* The crowd are desperate for Sinner to make a match of this, and they go wild when the two men face off at the net, a rat-a-tat-tat exchange won by a rasping backhand from sinner that makes 15-all. But then, controversy! Djokovic grunts mid-point, having already cracked a backhand down the line that Sinner stretches to return; “Hindrance!” intones the umpire; “15-30”. Djokovic approaches but doesn’t really unburden, Henman says he’s never seen that before, and Sinner did play his shot, but on the other hand, rules are rules and who doesn’t want their moment in the sun. Oh man, imagine the chinwag at change of ends if there’s a break here; Djokovic quickly makes 30-all, killjoy that he is, then finds a gorgeous response after Sinner sends his drop back across the net. It’s incredible really, I’m absolutely certain Djokovic wants the umpire to be wearing his racket as a necklace, but instead he’s davka using it for shots of delicate beauty … though as I type that, Sinner punishes a backhand winner down the line for deuce! Relief as our set-to remains in prospect, and after a succession of groundstrokes thunked down the middle, Djokovic goes long to cede advantage! It’d surely be too pretty for that hindrance call to alter the flow of the match and shonuff Djokovic quickly yanks us back to deuce, then the umpire reminds us he exists, chastising the champ for taking too long serving … just before he disburses a service winner. It’s incredible how he’s maintaining composure here, and when Sinner nets, you can’t help but think that Djokovic has actually been helped by that intervention, because he now has a sense of injustice while Sinner has again been shown the apparently infinite extent of what he’s up against. *Sinner 3-6 1-2 Djokovic Oh dear. Djokovic redirects a forehand down the line for 0-15, then two unforced errors and all of a sudden it’s 0-40; such is life. Sinner, though, saves the first break point when his opponent drops long, the second with a forehand winner inside-out into the corner, but in a microcosm of the match, he then slams a flat forehand long, and gets what he deserves. It’s hard enough playing the best of all time without handing over gimmes like that, but that’s the difference really; everyone does that apart from him. Sinner 3-6 1-1 Djokovic* How do we feel about dominant champions? On the one hand, it doesn’t feel healthy to see Djokovic cruising through majors at 36; on the other, Alcaraz was on top in Paris till the stress of it all took its toll and that won’t happen again; on a hard court, he’ll be even more of a handful; and people tune in to see if someone can beat the man. Darts isn’t the same since Phil Taylor retired and Michael van Gerwen dropped a few levels, snooker exploded when it boasted consecutive unbeatable champions, and Roger Federer was pretty good for our game. Anyway, Sinner makes 15-all with a lovely sliced drop, only to shank a backhand at 30-all; “a poor miss,” says Tim in comms. Djokovic hasn’t made a first serve in this game, then he does, but Sinner challenges and it’s out – decent peepers – but it makes no difference, because the Italian then frames one. He’s still making an impression when returning though; he just needs to, as the abovementioned Van Gerwen likes to say, “do the right things at the right times”. *Sinner 3-6 1-0 Djokovic Nice from Sinner, underarming a big forehand from corner to corner for 30-15. Neither he nor our match can deal with the concession of a break at this juncture, so the ace he finds at 30-all is crucial, and from there he closes out. Sinner 3-6 Djokovic* Sinner stretches to reach a return – that’s a fantastic get – and Djokovic errs long for 0-15! Then serves an ace. Then serves another ace. He is not human. Then serves another ace. He does well not to laugh, I told you he wasn’t human, then he serves a service winner. He’s an absolute disgrace, the best player under pressure there’s ever been in men’s tennis and perhaps only Chris Evert and Serena are his equal in women’s. He leads by one set to love, of course he does, but Sinner is in this match. *Sinner 3-5 Djokovic At change of ends we see that both Felicity Kendall and Floella Benjamin are in the house, two staples of an 80s childhood. It’s a while since anyone asked me what my favourite shape is, but in my Play chool days, I always hoped they’d go through the square window – to my eternal shame as, at the age of 44, I’ve realised that the circle is better. Sinner holds to 15, and is moving through his serice games really easily, problem being he’s ceded one break point and Djokovic being Djokovic, he seized it so will now serve for the first set. Sinner 2-5 Djokovic* This is a really fun match so far, one of the highest-standard I’ve seen this fortnight – though, for it to be a sustaining contest, Sinner could really do without falling behind. And again he gets into the game, banging a forehand winner down the line for 15-all only to net when he shouldn’t for 30-15. From there, Djokovic mooches to within a game of the first set, again sealing one with an ace down the middle. “Salad Cream? Just thinking about makes me want to be violently sick,” advises John Windmill, our pictures man. “Oh, Daniel.” But John, it’s so deliciously tangy – though just to be clear, I do not like sandwich spread. *Sinner 2-4 Djokovic In the interests of sharing the wealth, this is the best and most nostril-invading chrayne I’ve found; back on court, Sinner holds to love, and in some ways this is a classic Djokovic set, much closer to being broken than breaking, apart from the time he actually broke. Sinner 1-4 Djokovic* Further to Zack’s mayonnaise point, let me say here, very clearly, that salad cream is by far the superior condiment, thanks principally to the presence of taste. It’s not fashionable, no – though, last summer, Anya Hindmarch turned it into an ice cream – but still. Anyroad up, Sinner lets Djokovic off the hook at 15-all, hitting man not space so passed at the net, but then a slice drops fractionally long and this time yerman pounces, swinging a majestic inside-out backhand onto the line for break point. Djokovic has served fantastically this year but Sinner is creating opportunities … burning this one when on top in the rally, going cross with line open. He knows it too, indicating the shot he should’ve played, and seconds later it’s 4-1, an exclamation mark added to it with the ace down the T that clinches it. Sinner might worry that he won’t get many chances and he’s already missed four, but he’ll be telling himself there’s no reason he won’t keep making them. *Sinner 1-3 Djokovic Sinner quickly makes 30-0 before slamming an ace down the T. He needed that, though he’s actually playing pretty well, and a canny high-kicking second serve sets up a 40-15 rally which he finishes with yet another sizeable forehand. He’s on the board. I cannot wait to see Eubanks play again. Sinner 0-3 Djokovic* A terrific backhand cross-court, dug out almost from behind him, gives Sinner 0-15. But from there, Djokovic consolidates convincingly, and already the match looks within his command. “Challah Sandwich??? That’s borderline apikorsus!” writes Zack Dzialowski, who for those unfamiliar with the term, just called me a heretic. “Challah must never be eaten with anything besides mayonnaise or chrayne (possibly allowed to toast the leftovers on Moitze Shabbos!). A friend of mine is rather keen on toasted challah on Shabbat morning, but otherwise, chrayne – a glorious meld of beetroot and horseradish, the most beautiful shade of mauve, is tremendous, likewise hummus, but challah is also very good slapped around liver sausage or viennas. *Sinner 0-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner is the first player since Henman in 2002 to make the semis without facing a seed, but so far he looks fine with that, so of course as I type those words he sticks another forehand into the top of the net for 30-all. It’s amazing the power he generates off his chicken legs, but a swiped forehand drops wide and now it’s Djokovic with break point. Sinner really can’t afford to cede the advantage so early … but he does, a forehand sent wide; response required. Sinner 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server) In the process of losing the first point, Sinner slips – one on which to keep an eye – then at 30-0, he finds a decent pass, Djokovic unable to reach his volley at the net. Already, the world number one is looking to stick Sinner on his bike, hitting towards corners, but when he goes wide, he finds himself serving at 30-all, and facing a second delivery Sinner steps in then runs around his backhand to send as winner cross-court for break point! But another forehand towards the line is more accurate, making deuce, whereupon we enjoy the best rally of the match so far, Sinner ending it abruptly with a brutal forehand that isn’t even close to the corer, and we learn that, during this tournament, only Alcaraz has hit a bigger ball. This time, though, break point vanishes with a netted forehand, and from there, Djokovic closes out. That was a helluva start to the match. “I was there!” tweets Robert Walnut of the 2001 final. And off we go! Djokovic to serve. “Challah is like brioche,” reckons Mark Woldin, “to be lathered with butter, eaten with a hot coffee nearby. A fresh hot bagel with cream cheese and lox is one of the glories of the Western World. Get on board, Daniel!” If I’m totally honest, I find what I know to be a classic sandwich somewhat bland. Put me in cheirem. Out come our players, Sinner leading the way. “On the important note of bagels v challah,” emails Edan Tal, “I have conducted similarly lengthy research. I think it all depends on the quality and a good quality bagel trumps challah for a closed sandwich as challah tends to crumble. But a good bagel should be ashamed of its hole and be nearly closed at the point of consumption, as seen at Beigel Bake. A holy bagel is no match for challah though. Also, do you not think Grodzinski’s in Stamford Hill is a fair match for Daniel’s?” It’s years since I went to Grodz in N17, but I’ll have a shy next time I’m visiting my wife’s dressmaker – Tiferes in Dunsmure Road for anyone wanting a top bloke and craftsman. I find the challah sandwich can be prevented from crumbling by rapid insertion into facehole. “On court I try to do the right things, but off court I can be a classic one,” Sinner tells BBC when explaining he’s not as serious as he seems and is actually quite funny. He’s from northern Italy near the Austrian border, and in general, folk from there are said to be more stereotypically Austrian than Italian in temperament, but on a very basic level he seems sound. He’s also a tremendous all-round athlete, good enough to have been a pro skier and footballer, such that even if he wasn’t an interesting bloke, which he is, he’d still have the personality proxies we all wish for. Tim Henman is in the BBC studio, wondering how on earth this tournament ever got finished playing one day fewer and with no roofs, noting that rallies are shorter these days. I’d not thought of that, but I guess if points are serve, return, putaway volley, it makes perfect sense. It’s funny, though, that two of my all-time favourite finals were completed on Monday, Edberg beating Becker in 1990 and Ivanisevic finally getting his title in 2001 by seeing off Rafter – coincidentally, Henman’s one that really got away. Regular readers will, no doubt, be wondering where on earth Coach Calvin Betton has got to with his pithy tactical breakdowns, and I’m pleased to report that the answer is right here: “Can’t see anyway Djokovic is troubled. He’ll make too many balls and keep Sinner moving so he never has a set base to hit his big shots out of. Medvedev and Alcaraz could be interesting. If Medvedev serves well then it will be really tight. Alcaraz probably just has enough to hit through him. Medvedev doesn’t have much to hurt with if his serve isn’t happening. The key shot will be Alcaraz’s drop shot cos Medvedev stands so far back.” I wonder if he’ll adjust there. I imagine he’ll stick with his usual position to return, but he must know he needs a plan to combat one of the best and, increasingly, most renowned shots in the game. Real talk: bagels do not, in my opinion, make for any kind of decent sandwich. No give, hard to arrange a decent filling to bread ratio, and just not that tasty. Challah is far, far better in every aspect, and the extensive, decades-long research I’ve undertaken in this important area tells me that the best in London can be found at Daniels – or, indeed Daniel’s, depending on where you look – in Temple Fortune. I’m not sure whether to thank or blame Oli Goldman for bringing this monstrosity to my attention. I guess you might argue that anything is improved by its insertion between two slices of bread, but you might also contact The Hague. It’s minging in London today, so I’m almost certain these matches will take place with the roof on. I doubt it’ll make much difference to Djokovic, but Sinner will probably be pleased as indoors tends to favour the harder hitter, and against the greatest, you need every advantage you can get. Hello and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 – day 12! Our women’s final is set and now it’s time for the men. We begin with the defending champion, playing his 12th semi-final at the All England Club – he’s won nine – a venue at which he’s not been beaten since 2017. And it’s hard to see that changing here, given his earth-shattering ability, spectacular form, and sense of mission. He is not on course for a calendar-year Grand Slam – rather it seems almost inevitable. However, there’s always a however. Jannik Sinner comes from the third generation of players bested by Novak Djokovic, but unlike most, he knows he can beat him – not because he has, but because he nearly did, losing from two sets to love up in last year’s quarter-finals. Sinner can easily rationalise that he’s a much better player now, more settled in his game, more at home in these surroundings and better able to negotiate the big moments – plus he can hit anyone, and I mean anyone, off the court. He’ll need to play better than ever before, but of all the men on the tour bar Carlos Alcaraz, he has the game and coldness most suited to ruining Djokovic’s day. Talking of Alcaraz, he has again been brilliant through this tournament, his explosive forehand not just the most thrilling shot in the game but one of the greatest sights in all sport. But Daniil Medvedev is an opponent who’s seen it all, gradually growing into the fortnight with a serve big enough to trouble anyone and a tactic of standing beyond the baseline that might just neutralise his opponent’s power. Of course, that opponent is not underfurnished in the guile department, but this is only his third major semi and in his last one, just a month ago, he succumbed to cramp. So, though Alcaraz has unshakeable confidence that he’s good enough to win this, now, he doesn’t know for sure, and Medvedev will be doing all he can to make him live that uncertainty. This is going to be good!

But Mark Rutte came unstuck on Monday, telling shocked MPs and reporters in The Hague he would not be standing in the next elections after his divided coalition government collapsed on Friday over asylum policy. The decision brings to an end the 56-year-old’s 17-year tenure as leader of the liberal-conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and 13 years as prime minister of the Netherlands at the head of four different governments. “I do this with mixed feelings, with emotion,” he said. “But it feels right.” As the EU’s longest-serving government leader after Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, his name has been floated for international jobs, including at Nato and the European Council. In characteristically low-key style, however, Rutte said he harboured no such ambitions. For several years now, he has taught social studies once a week at a high school in The Hague. “Maybe I’ll do it a couple of times a week,” he said. Analysts have long said Rutte had three key assets: first, he was a skilful, savvy operator with a talent for building and maintaining unlikely alliances – so much so that his critics felt he was always more interested in power than principles. He has never found it hard, for example, to pander to the far right on issues such as immigration, “Dutch values” and integration, forming his first coalition in 2010 with the backing of the firebrand anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders. In Europe, too, his leadership of the “frugals” opposed to EU bailouts drew fury from member states in the south, who called him “Mr No”. But he managed ultimately to find common cause with Germany and France on most issues. Rutte’s second major asset was his image as “Mr Normal”. Only rarely was he out of step with the views of his voters, seeming at times to pick up shifts in public opinion even before they occurred (as an example, he initially supported, then condemned, the Netherlands’ “Zwarte Piet” blackface tradition). He still lives in the same part of The Hague where he grew up, in a house he bought with friends as a student, he bikes to work – except if he is in a hurry, when he drives a battered Saab – and goes on holiday with the same people. In short, Rutte projects the kind of down-to-earth, no-nonsense, cautious image the Dutch adore: he once said that owing too much to a bank would keep him awake, and on another occasion refused to let cleaners mop up his coffee after he spilt it in parliament, insisting on doing it himself. The youngest of seven children, his father Izaak’s first wife died in a Japanese internment camp in Indonesia. The family fled the former colony and started again from scratch in The Hague, with Izaak eventually marrying his late wife’s sister, Rutte’s mother. Rutte’s older brother died of Aids, which he has said made him realise “you only get one chance at life”. Rutte worked for Unilever before becoming junior social affairs minister in 2002, VVD party leader in 2006, and prime minister four years later. Perhaps the outgoing Dutch prime minister’s biggest advantage was that nothing ever seemed to stick to him. Even in 2021, when his coalition resigned over a scandal in which 20,000 families, many from minority ethnic backgrounds, were wrongly accused of childcare subsidy fraud, he bounced back, with the VVD increasing its seat tally at the next election. He also narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, as well as a parliamentary motion censuring his behaviour and accusing him of undermining public trust and “not speaking the truth” during particularly fraught coalition negotiations that year. Rutte ultimately ran out of road, however, over his demands for a limit on family reunifications for asylum seekers, a move bitterly opposed by his coalition partners ChristenUnie, a Christian democratic party, and the centre-left Democracy 66. A managerial rather than a visionary leader – his favourite quote is reportedly one of the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt’s: “People with visions should see a doctor” – his longstanding policy of meeveren, altijd meeveren (go with the flow, always go with the flow) – finally failed him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"Stretching his 15 minutes of fame: why Andy Warhol still has the power to inspire ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/mar/26/andy-warhol-new-plays-books-exhibitions","fields":{"bodyText":"When he appears in Nicole Flattery’s recently published novel Nothing Special, Andy Warhol is a spectral presence. “I never saw him come in but I felt the atmosphere change when he did,” Flattery writes from the watchful point of view of the teenage narrator of the book. The coming-of-age novel set in the mid 1960s, with some flashes into the present, follows Mae, a lonely teenager who drops out of school after finding herself drawn into the new world of Warhol’s storied Factory in Manhattan. While art and drama and debauchery happen around her among the artist and his acolytes, Mae has the more prosaic job of typist. She is transcribing recordings of conversations that will form the basis of a: A Novel, Warhol’s (real) experimental book from 1968. “I feel things work if you just don’t often see that person,” Flattery says of her version of Warhol. “It’s in their interest to remain out of your eyeline. They’ll only have the power if they make themselves like a distant, inaccessible figure.” Flattery’s reimagining of Warhol might see him as distant, but 36 years after his death, he is ever-present in the public’s imagination. In fact, the recent obsession with him in theatre, film and books can make it seem as though you are never more than 6ft away from a Warhol-related event. Opening on 31 March at London’s Fashion and Textile museum is Andy Warhol: The Textiles, a survey of his lesser-seen textile designs made in his time as a successful commercial artist in the 1950s and early 60s. In April, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris will launch a show of the mid-1980s paintings he made with Jean-Michel Basquiat. Last year The Collaboration, Anthony McCarten’s play, which premiered at the Young Vic and later transferred to New York, explored the relationship between the two artists – a film version, directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, is in the works. Last year also brought a high-profile six-part documentary series on Netflix made by Ryan Murphy, based on Warhol’s diaries, which were published posthumously in 1989. At last September’s New York fashion week, Tommy Hilfiger’s catwalk show was indebted to the artist. Perhaps we are seeing the long tail of his incessant industriousness and boundless influence. “Warhol is omnipresent. Somehow he seems to, in this digital, internet age, strike a chord with people,” says Richard Chamberlain, co-curator of the textiles exhibition, and co-author of the book Pop: Design, Culture, Fashion 1956-1976. “I think his subject matter, although it can be quite deep and thought-provoking, is quite accessible. And there’s so much about the man and what he was involved with, which is interesting to people.” Flattery says that she was particularly influenced by the artist’s experimental films from the 1960s. The Hilfiger fashion week show also called on the Factory years, with broader nods to Warhol’s silver clouds installation, his superstar muses and his nous for branding. The pair were friends in the 1980s – “you could say it is a meeting of preppy minds” Hilfiger said in September. Anything that draws on the Factory is immediately evocative of the era. It was in the mid-1960s when a Warhol look first solidified in the public consciousness: jeans and a Breton or black top, with a leather jacket and sunglasses, all presented with an inscrutable gaze. The move away from the homogeneity of the 1950s into an outfit of the counterculture isn’t unique to Warhol. “To me, it’s a perennial popularity of mid-1960s bohemian modernist style,” says Nathanial Weiner, lecturer in cultural studies at Central Saint Martins, London . “People really liked that era, because it’s sort of the pinnacle, almost of western casual dress.” After he was shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968, Warhol withdrew from some of the free-wheeling aspects of the Factory, and honed his outfits into a more toned-down uniform of blue jeans and shirt, blazer and tie. It managed to seem both unremarkably plain, yet uniquely Warholian. Andy the worker. His life and work started to revolve around more established versions of celebrity, rather than around his own creations. By the 1980s Warhol was often clad all in black, in jeans, polo neck and a jacket, with New Balance or white Reebok Classic trainers. Ever more rake-thin and with his silver-blonde wig at its most shocking, this is a stark vision of Warhol – perhaps indicative of a scramble for relevancy in his friendship with then up-and-coming art star Jean-Michel Basquiat. This latter look, particularly the hair, has become a signifier of Warhol. It is the version that actor Paul Bettany plays in The Collaboration. David Bowie performed it in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 Basquiat biopic. “I really didn’t want him to overshadow the book,” says Nicole Flattery of Nothing Special. “I could go back through the appearances of Andy Warhol in films: he’s in the film The Doors [played by Crispin Glover] and Factory Girl [played by Guy Pearce]. I feel with a presence like that, if you don’t get it fully right it can really mess up everything.” It’s not just his look but also his personal life that seems to continue to capture people’s imagination. “I thought that the recent mini-series, The Andy Warhol Diaries, was very interesting,” says Scott King, a graphic designer and creator of The Debrist Manifesto, a book on art-world failure and the pursuit of perfectionism. “It showed him as an active participant in love and disappointment and – quite boring-looking – weekends away in the Hamptons. It humanised him and showed a tenderness, a sadness. I mean, the best work he made was incredibly melancholic wasn’t it? But we don’t usually associate him with tenderness.” But, as photographer Nat Finklestein’s 1999 book The Factory Years displays, Warhol and his 1960s coterie had already long since created a vision of indelible debauched cool. “The Warhol stance,” says Chamberlain, “the very sort of hip, Velvet Underground attitudes, that is still very refreshing, and very vital to people. I think there is a Warhol that still has an edginess.” Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T09:58:46Z","webTitle":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T12:51:53Z","webTitle":"Johnson takes swipe at Truss plans for fracking and North Sea drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift a ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The comments will be viewed as a jibe at Truss, who last week pledged to “end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking”, and is said to want to issue up to 130 new drilling licences for oil and gas companies to explore new fields in the North Sea. Reflecting on his future, Johnson said he was “ready to get on with life”, and he refused to be drawn on whether he would disappear quickly from politics, like David Cameron, or remain on the backbenches, as Theresa May has done. “Only time will tell, is my answer on that one,” he replied. “My intention – and what I certainly will do – is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me.” Johnson also evaded questions on whether he had any regrets about his premiership, saying he would leave it to “younger, fitter, more active journalists than me” to assess. Pressed on what message he had for people worried about paying their energy bills this winter amid rising inflation and the threat of a recession, he said people should be braced for a “very tough winter and we just have to accept that”. “We’re on your side,” he insisted, adding there would be a further package of support from the next prime minister, who will be announced next Monday and will take office the following day. The “future will be better when we’re more self-reliant” and less dependent on energy imports, Johnson predicted. After being accused by Rishi Sunak of ignoring the harms of lockdown during the Covid pandemic, Johnson said the criticism that it had caused the huge backlog of NHS surgery was an “inversion of logic”. Instead, he said, the opposite was the case; if the three national lockdowns had not been ordered, the NHS would be in an “even worse” position.

Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said that the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. “The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them,” the former prime minister of Norway said as he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels. The development follows months of internal debate in Washington over the risks of Ukraine deploying F-16s to attack targets on Russian territory and potentially escalating the conflict. The US has control over the jets’ re-export from any country that has them in its arsenal. As recently as February the US president, Joe Biden, declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine’s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Kyiv has in recent days warned that its long-anticipated counteroffensive is running into Russia’s air and artillery superiority. Despite those challenges, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said on Thursday that progress in its counteroffensive was being made, with Ukraine regaining control over 4o sq miles (103 sq km) since the weekend. Ukrainian forces were said to have pushed 2 to 4 miles into formerly occupied lands. Hromov told journalists that his troops had benefited from the provision of MiG-29 planes from Poland and Slovakia and claimed, without providing evidence, that Russian soldiers were deliberately inflicting wounds upon themselves to avoid battle. Hromov said: “The Ukrainian army has gained considerable experience and skill on the battlefield this year, and we are ready and will continue to fight until the complete liberation of our own territories, even with our bare hands. With heavy weapons from our allies, this will happen faster.” Ukraine’s army is said to have advanced by 2 miles near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia region and by up to 4 miles near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: “There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. The enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces.” Stoltenberg said western hardware was making a difference in the fighting. Moscow has widely disseminated video footage of US Bradley armoured vehicles and German-made Leopard tanks being hit by Russian fire. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine retained sufficient firepower for the battle to come. “I think the Russians have shown us that same five vehicles about 1,000 times from 10 different angles,” he said. “But quite frankly, the Ukrainians still have a lot of combat capability, combat power. “This will continue to be a tough fight, as we anticipate it, and I believe that the element that does the best in terms of sustainment will probably have the advantage at the end of the day.” The US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said it was too early “to put any estimates” on how long the Ukrainian counteroffensive would last. He said: “This is a very difficult fight; it is a very violent fight and it will likely take a considerable amount of time and at high cost.” Russian military bloggers have claimed as many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike by a US-made Himars rocket system earlier this week, although Ukrainian officials declined to comment. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark were sending “high priority” air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery would be completed within weeks. Last month, it emerged the UK had already delivered multiple Storm Shadow cruise missiles, giving Ukraine’s defence a new long-range strike capability. That move had prompted threats from the Kremlin and earlier this week Belarus’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, engaged in further nuclear sabre-rattling as he announced that Russian tactical warheads would be relocated to Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg said the situation was being monitored but that it did not appear to be a significant move. “We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing,” he said. “So far, we haven’t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture”. He added: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia to assess the risks to Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The dam’s reservoir provides the cooling water for the plant. After his inspection, Grossi said measures had been taken to stabilise the situation but he added that inspectors would stay at the facility, in a sign of the concerns the visit had raised among officials at the UN’s atomic watchdog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T01:49:30Z","webTitle":"In the new gold rush, farmers are asked to decide between food, carbon and renewable energy – but we need them all | Gabrielle Chan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","fields":{"bodyText":"This week we are expecting representatives of a solar energy company to come to our farm in southern New South Wales. They want to build next door. We are not in a renewable energy zone but we are close to existing transmission lines. It is a traditional mixed agricultural area, with relatively safe rainfall by southern Australian standards. We are also classed as inner regional, close to population centres. In theory, we could grow food, energy or carbon. One of the biggest issues that comes across my desk as a rural editor is the debate over changing land use. As with most rural issues, eventually it comes home. We are not alone. Across the country, communities are debating how best to plan for old and new land uses without much guidance or support from governments or the companies pursuing the new gold. Competing land claims range from food to mining precious metals to solar energy to wind turbines to carbon farming. Our stories about these issues – such as a windfarm in Nundle or a coal seam gas mine on the Liverpool Plains or the Darling Downs – are some of the most closely read and contested. The issue is not space. Australia is big. Farmers themselves need power so will be expanding their own power production. The issue is that everyone wants land close to existing infrastructure and populations to deliver food or energy at scale. While smart policy would accept that combined land use is the future, a key factor for farmers will be the potential returns per hectare. As Australian farmers have become some of the least trade protected in the world, the mighty dollar is the key determinant of survival in a dry climate. Will one hectare of food give a greater economic return than one hectare of solar panels or one hectare of carbon farming or one hectare of native habitat or biodiversity in the predicted “green Wall Street” markets? And how will this new use affect environmental assets such as ground and surface water, or infrastructure such as roads? These are the decisions farmers will be weighing up. The reality is, state and federal governments and Australians living in metropolitan areas are increasingly looking to regional landscapes to deliver affordable energy and greater emission reductions after more than a wasted decade of climate idiocy. At the same time, global corporations are hunting for carbon credits to offset business behaviours and production they don’t want to change or have not changed fast enough. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter All of this must be done while increasing the volume and health benefits of the food already grown. Consumers are increasingly demanding cheap food produced with lower emissions, higher animal welfare standards and greater transparency. Australian food producers have been going like “stabbed rats” for the past three years to take advantage of higher commodity prices and three consecutive La Niñas to grow more food. It was all very welcome, unless you were flooded out. Elsewhere, big trends continue to collide. There was a searing heatwave in Europe. Food inflation has been running rampant, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, higher input costs, higher labour costs, supply chain issues and in some cases increased supermarket profits. Nations are rethinking their food systems and keeping more in the larder. India, responsible for 40% of world’s rice exports, recently banned exports of non-basmati white rice. It is just one example of a post-Covid world where countries and individuals want to become a little more self-sufficient. Equally, no nation wants to be living in energy poverty and Australia has the capacity to be a renewable superpower. Yet last week the Bureau of Meteorology forecast warmer and drier conditions for the coming months, saying “higher than usual maximum temperatures are very likely”. Previously optimistic farmers in our neck of the woods are countenancing a “bobtail spring”, cut short by higher temperatures and less rain. Firm policy guidelines are needed about how these climate and market forces hit the ground. A decade of denial from the Morrison government has led to a stampede to catch up to provide energy and carbon sequestration. There is a new gold rush, and it needs land. Consistent sensible land management policy that lasts more than one political term will be vital. Without it, rural communities will be susceptible to breathless campaigns like Tuesday’s Rally Against Reckless Renewables, attended by the likes of Matt Canavan, who is suddenly worried about “pristine rainforest and wildlife habitat”. If you don’t believe me, consider the valedictory speech of Andrew Campbell, who led the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, last month. At the National Rural Press Club in Canberra he was brutally honest about the challenge ahead for governments. “Patchy, brilliant innovation has been accompanied by institutional amnesia, ad hockery and inability to stay the course,” he said. “Too often a change of government, a change of minister or razor gang in a tight budget has led to worthy initiatives being discontinued, useful organisations being abolished, or unproductive … No wonder episodes of Utopia are triggering for so many people in this town.” There are critical independent decisions to be made with the national interest in mind. As to our own little land use decision, we will hear this energy company out and weigh up the benefits and the costs. How do you want us to make these decisions? Would you like us to produce healthy food or energy for electrification or sequester carbon or save and build habitat or all of the above? Because, frankly Australia, I am confused.

Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK’s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: “The case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. “Even to consider building a £20bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.” The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK’s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: “It’s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.” Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: “We are proud to represent TASC in the local community’s continued fight to help protect Suffolk’s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court’s attention.” The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. • This article was amended on 8 August 2022.

Rumors on social media suggest that the attack was carried out to stop a local drag show. But officials have said a motive for the attack is unknown. Two power stations were struck with gunfire on Saturday at about 7pm eastern time, causing tens of thousands of residents to go without electricity, the Associated Press reported. The power outage affected Moore county, which is about two hours outside Charlotte. Authorities began investigating the outage as a crime after utility workers found signs of vandalism at the power grid, including evidence of gunfire at two substations, reported CNN. The Moore county sheriff, Ronnie Fields, described the investigation into the power outage during a Sunday news conference, reporting that “someone opened fire on the substation, the same thing with the other one”. Fields added that state investigators were also working with the FBI to find out who is responsible. “The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields said. But “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept that they’re the ones that done it”, Fields added, saying that officials are looking into different possibilities. As of Monday morning, almost 30,000 people were still without power, according to Duke Energy, an energy provider for the area. Local government officials have also acknowledged the attack. The North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, spoke about the power grid’s targeting on Twitter, writing: “An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.” North Carolina state senator Tom McInnis called the attack a “terrible act” that seemed to be malicious, the New York Times reported. Authorities opened at least one shelter running on a power generator and imposed a nightly curfew after the outage, the Times added. Schools in the county were also closed on Monday.

Blessed – and cursed – with the same supernatural abilities possessed by his mother, young Iqbal (Idan Aedan) is torn between his power of exorcism and his desire to lead a normal teenage existence. Roaming the damp corridors of his dilapidated apartment complex where the creaky lift never works, Iqbal encounters terrors at every turn: horrifying undead souls with rotten teeth and bloodshot eyes. In dramatising Iqbal’s constant state of unease, Blood Flower resorts to the unsophisticated medium of jump scares. For much of the film, Iqbal is too busy running away from a neverending succession of frightening premonitions and slithering ghosts that it’s difficult to gauge his inner emotions, or even his personality. While the visual effects are striking, especially during an extended exorcism sequence that dials the gore factor up to eleven, they also overshadow the more interesting narrative strands, such as the void left by a neglectful father, or the fragility of the nuclear family structure. It’s handsomely designed, even if the titular plant, with its ivory phallic shape, gets little screen time. As Blood Flower trudges towards its conclusion, the film turns out to be a lacklustre trauma-as-plot horror. The final twist rests heavily on the terror that results from sexual violence against women, yet most of the female characters are barely developed; they seem to be defined by their victimisation rather than their own inner selves. Laden with an overstuffed plot that values gore over atmosphere and characterisation, the macabre ending feels like a cheap trick to add an unearned dose of shock. • Blood Flower is released on 8 September on Shudder."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:00:45Z","webTitle":"Australia’s first nuclear submarines should be built in the US, Andrew Hastie says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/06/australias-first-nuclear-submarines-should-be-built-in-the-us-andrew-hastie-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia should strike a deal with the US to have the first of its nuclear-powered submarines built in Connecticut as “there’s too much risk in doing it on our own”, the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, has declared. Speaking before senior Australian ministers meet their counterparts in the US this week, Hastie said Australia should seek one or two Virginia-class submarines off the US production line by the end of 2030. Hastie did not deny this may require Australia to subsidise the expansion of the US’s already-crowded production line, but said the strategic circumstances meant there was no time to waste. Authoritarian powers were “on the move” and it would take too long to start the flagship Aukus project with Australian domestic production, he said. “Too long, too long – and there’s too much risk in doing it on our own,” Hastie said. “We need to get a boat in the water, or two boats in the water, and at the same time be building the capacity here.” The opposition leader and former defence minister, Peter Dutton, has previously floated the idea of buying the first submarines from the US, but Hastie’s new comments strengthen those calls at a critical time. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Aukus will be at the top of the agenda when the defence minister, Richard Marles, and foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, hold annual talks with their US counterparts, Lloyd Austin and Antony Blinken, in Washington DC this week. Marles is also expected to join the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, on a visit to the site in Connecticut that builds nuclear submarines. Hastie called for “increased diplomatic engagement with the United States, not just across the legislature, but also through the bureaucracy”. “The US has been making nuclear subs for a long time, so this isn’t new to them. It is special to us – and you’ve really got to make sure our presence is known in Washington DC.” Hastie said it would make “total sense to get a boat or two off the production line into the water” this decade but this should not delay work to train Australian submarine crews and develop base facilities. “Simultaneously we should be building our industrial base as well, searching for talent at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels for people who will be part of this nation-building industry,” he said. Hastie cited the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s warnings that China was on track “to take action against Taiwan from sometime in the late 2020s or in 2030s”. Hastie said Australia needed options during this “Rudd window” including new missiles and unmanned platforms such as drones. “We need hard power, which gives us a deterrent against a would-be adversary. That means we need to be able to reach out and ring someone’s bell at distance and demonstrate risk in picking a fight with Australia,” he said. “I think that’s what Aukus will deliver when we get our nuclear submarines, but we also need to look at other strike capabilities, whether they be unmanned or manned platforms, both subsurface and surface.” Hastie said he was open minded about options that may be suggested by the defence strategic review conducted the former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. “We want to work constructively with the government,” Hastie said. “Our mission is the same as theirs and that is to have a strong Australia that’s capable of resisting an aggressor.” Hastie said the war in Ukraine proved Australia also needed to strengthen its supply lines: “As a trading nation with the vast majority of our imports coming across the seas, we need to think about how we’re building our fuel stocks, our pharmaceutical stocks, and other essentials.” Australia, the US and the UK have set a March deadline for decisions on how Canberra’s plans for at least eight nuclear-powered powered submarines can be achieved. Any push for an offshore build, at least for the first couple of submarines, could be politically contentious in South Australia. The Labor premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, has said it would “not be acceptable” for his state to miss out on promised submarine manufacturing jobs. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to attend a meeting of the Aukus defence ministers in Washington DC later this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T00:00:20Z","webTitle":"As Liddell bites the dust, can NSW supply enough power for a looming El Niño summer peak?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","fields":{"bodyText":"AGL Energy’s Liddell coal-fired power station in New South Wales closed on Friday, Australia’s first big power plant closure since Hazelwood’s demise in Victoria in 2017. Liddell had been operating at less than half its original 2,000-megawatt capacity for some time. Still, its exit sharpens the focus on the challenges facing not only NSW but also the rest of the national electricity market (Nem). More closures to come Origin Energy’s black coal-fired Eraring power station is scheduled to be the next to shut, with a planned August 2025 closure. The plant, also in NSW, boasts almost 2,900MW of capacity, making it Australia’s largest. Relatively costly coal contracts, though, mean Eraring is not always raring to go. NSW’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, legislated by the state Coalition government in 2020, is intended to bridge the gap. It aims to attract at least 12 gigawatts of wind and solar farms and 2GW of long-duration storage by 2030. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup However, the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, says “the roadmap has already been tested by the delays in Snowy [Hydro’s 2.0 pumped storage project] and the foreshadowed possible closure of Eraring”. Snowy 2.0 is scheduled to be ready by December 2027 but more than a few – including in NSW – expect more delays. Officials say they expect to have sufficient new generation sources to fill the gaps left by Eraring. Early exits by any of the other plants, though, could stretch supplies. “The government’s approach will be to keep the lights on by getting as much renewable energy into operation as soon as possible, accelerating the roadmap where possible and working with coal-fired operators on their transition to ensure there is enough generation for households and businesses,” Sharpe said. Interstate competition NSW relies on Queensland and Victoria for about 10% of its power. Both states, however, have recently accelerated their own renewables rush, particularly in Queensland, a laggard in the decarbonisation shift. One NSW official said geographic spread should moderate the risks. “It’s really unusual in the [Nem] to have a peak demand event in multiple cities at the same time,” he said this week. Last June, however, saw a widespread cold snap across eastern states that pushed supplies to the brink. Flooding in coalmines and Covid-delayed maintenance at power plants exacerbated the strain, but a similar event this winter could test the grid, now that Liddell is shut and Queensland’s 825MW coal-fired Callide C plant remains out of action after an explosion. Historically, summer provides the peak of power demand and with the looming risk of a powerful El Niño the spike in usage might be particularly sharp later this year. Extra transmission links between states will help, such as the Project EnergyConnect between NSW and South Australia, expected by July 2026. Still, evidence of the ongoing constraints include curbs on existing lines that cut imports by NSW from Victoria by an average 138MW in the first quarter, the Australian Energy Market Operator said on Friday. Renewables (and storage) to the rescue? The great bulk of new investment in the electricity sector is directed to renewable energy since costs are well below alternatives, particularly nuclear, the CSIRO and Aemo say. More clean energy should bring down wholesale prices, as happened in the March quarter, Aemo said on Friday. Renewables now supply about 37% of the Nem’s power, a share that should rise to about 82% by 2030 according to federal goals. Victoria is banking on offshore windfarms to play a big role in supplying its energy. It also has set a target to have enough storage by 2035 to power half the state’s homes. However, the industry is warning that while about 5GW of new solar and windfarms started construction nationwide last year, not a lot of capacity was completed. The pipeline of new projects is also beginning to shrink. Stefan Jarnason, a co-founder of Solar Analytics and an industry veteran, said the NSW government considering an intervention to extend Eraring beyond 2025 will deter renewables investors. “As long as the government’s going ‘maybe we will or maybe we won’t close this 2GW coal-fired power station’, you’re gonna sit on your hands until they give you a firm signal,” he said. Better policy would be to make it easier for households to install rooftop solar – or expand what they have – and even add batteries. “We know that the largest source of new generation every year for the past five years has been rooftop solar and will likely continue to be for the next 30 years,” Jarnson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T18:01:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards Russian defence, say western officials – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the country’s deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov later claimed that Delimkhanov was alive and well. Kalibr missiles hit the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa at 2.40am on Wednesday, setting a warehouse, a business centre, an educational institution, restaurants and shops ablaze. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner’s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin’s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry – an order Prigozhin has refused to follow. You can read more on this story from my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth here: The death toll from a strike on a warehouse and apartment block in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been raised to 12 after the death of a 67-year-old man in hospital overnight, as my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to a “dire humanitarian crisis” in flooded communities downstream, the United Nations in Ukraine has said. The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, was breached in the early hours of 6 June, allowing some of the 18 cubic kilometres of water it held back to surge down across a swathe of southern Ukraine. The damage resulting from the collapse has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people. The Ukrainian government has now requested the UN to help launch a post-disaster needs assessment that will look in depth at the long-term implications of the devastating destruction of the dam, the United Nations in Ukraine tweeted. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said that Adam Delimkhanov, one of his senior commanders, is alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messenger app on Wednesday that Delimkhanov was “alive and well and not even wounded”. Kadyrov added that he had known Delimkhanov was uninjured from the start of what he called “a fake information attack”, but had remained silent in order to embarrass Ukrainian media outlets which had reported on the commander’s alleged injury. There had been unconfirmed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Asked about the reports of Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, being injured, the Kremlin earlier on Wednesday said it was “worried” and was waiting for clarification about what had really happened (See post at 13:35). Russia appears to have doubled the number of trained dolphins defending Sevastopol naval base in Crimea, evidence seen by Naval News suggests. Analysis indicates the number of trained dolphins has increased from 3-4 to 6-7. This means dolphin patrols might have increased in frequency and have possibly been covering a wider area. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Kyiv’s Western backers will meet on Thursday at Nato headquarters in Brussels to get the latest update from Ukraine’s defence minister on the progress of the assaults, AFP reports. “The most obvious thing is to ensure they have the weapons, the supplies, the maintenance to continue to conduct the offensive,” Stoltenberg told journalists. He added that there was always recognition that Ukraine would suffer losses as it seeks to breach heavily fortified Russian lines. Stoltenberg said: There will be casualties, also, when it comes to modern Nato equipment. No one expected there to be zero casualties. The realities of this is fierce, fierce fighting. Ukrainian troops have advanced 200-500 meters at various sections of the front line around the small eastern city of Bakhmut and 300-350 meters in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Overnight, Russian missile attacks killed three people in the Black Sea city of Odesa and three in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. The officials’ sombre tone was clearly designed to lower expectations of a transformative breakthrough. However they nevertheless insisted the counteroffensive was “going in the right direction” and the losses were not unexpected. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces are forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. “The vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,” the officials said. The officials denied Ukraine had lost as many as 120 armoured vehicles – a figure touted by Moscow. One official said: “The Russian manoeuvre and defence approach is proving challenging for the Ukraine and costly to attacking forces hence the advance at the moment is slow”. The officials suggested there is likely to be “grinding costly warfare likely for many months to come. This is incredibly difficult. They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines. Whilst they are inflicting casualties on the Russians they are not significant because the Russians are choosing the time to withdraw in a manner similar to the way the Ukrainians defended themselves against Russian vehicles. “The idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people’s wildest dreams. “In this conflict the advantage has always been with the defender”. The officials said it may not be clear for as long as three months whether the offensive could be classified as a success. Most of the vehicles that have been damaged have been hit by mines. As the Ukrainians advance they are also more exposed to drone assaults. The officials played down suggestions that this assault was likely to give Ukraine a tactical advantage as early as September, and so give it space to reopen talks with Vladimir Putin. “We are a long way away from Ukraine being in a position to reopen negotiations”, the officials said. The slow progress is likely to place greater pressure on the west to signal to Putin that it is prepared for a long haul, and will not treat the counteroffensive as Ukraine’s one shot at reclaiming its territory. Ukraine has long feared support may decline in the west if the supply of western arms does not produce early tangible results. Western officials admitted that western-supplied jets may not be available in the short term, even if training of Ukrainian pilots is now underway. The officials also suggested Putin might have taken a truth serum before meeting military correspondents where he said Russia was suffering severe tank losses and suffering problems with its military industrial base. Even though there was still a huge amount of confusion about exact Russian deployment, the officials said the vast majority of Russian forces are now committed to positions on the line partly due to the sheer size of the line that has to be defended. That gave Russia little room for further manoeuvre to deploy reinforcements if a point in the line became vulnerable. By contrast Ukraine was holding back some of its heaviest armoury, including Challenger tanks. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has rebuffed growing international pressure on Ankara to ratify Sweden’s Nato membership bid before the western defence alliance meets in July. Western officials had hoped Erdoğan would soften his position on the diplomatically charged issue after he secured a hard-fought re-election last month (AFP reports). But Erdoğan signalled no major shift in comments released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Sweden and its Nordic neighbour Finland ended decades of military non-alignment and applied to join the US-led defence bloc in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey and fellow Nato member Hungary ratified Finland’s membership this year. But both countries’ parliaments have yet to approve Sweden’s entry. Turkey is pushing Sweden to ban and crack down on rallies by Kurdish supporters of a group recognised as a terrorist organisation by Ankara. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio, Reuters reports. In September 2022, several unexplained underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipelines that link Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate though they have yet to single out who was responsible. There has been an update on the fire that broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine (See post at 12:54). Citing reports, the Kyiv Independent tweeted that the fire was said to have started due to “non-compliance with safety precautions during repair work”. Here are some pictures of a local clean up effort in Odesa after a missile attack hit the southern Ukrainian city. The Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said on Wednesday it had voted to give its initial backing to legislation that would allow the defence ministry to sign contracts with suspected or convicted criminals to fight in Ukraine. More than 15 months into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to recruit more soldiers for Europe’s largest land conflict since the second world war. Under the proposed changes, a contract could be concluded with someone being investigated for committing a crime, or who is having their case heard in court, or who has been convicted – but before the verdict takes legal effect, according to the database of the Duma. People convicted of sexual crimes, treason, terrorism or extremism would not be able to sign up, Reuters reports. Those who do sign up would be exempt from criminal liability upon completion of their contract or if they receive awards for their combat prowess. The Wagner mercenary group was previously allowed to recruit convicts from prisons to fight in Ukraine, but said in February it had stopped. Prison rights activists say the defence ministry has taken over that process but wanted to make changes. The new changes being examined by the Duma do not cover recruitment of people already serving their sentences and the defence ministry has not commented. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened, Reuters reports. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine (See post at 10:32am). Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. Vladimir Putin will hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday with Cuba’s prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, the Kremlin said. Russia is seeking to bolster relations with Latin American, African and other non-western countries as the west tries to isolate and economically punish it for its invasion of Ukraine. Germany enshrined a Nato commitment to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence and identified Russia as the biggest threat to European security as the government announced its first ever National Security Strategy on Wednesday. Here are some of the highlights of Germany’s strategy outlined in a policy document and at a government press conference, as reported by Reuters: Russia is the biggest threat to peace in the Euro-Atlantic area Russia is trying to destabilise European democracies, weaken EU and Nato German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it is important to continue to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, including when the war ends Germany’s military budget was the seventh largest in the world last year behind the US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK. Nato members pledged in 2014 to move towards spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024. A fire broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region close to the border with Ukraine, state-owned news agency RIA reported. It did not say what had caused the blaze. Here is an update on the UN nuclear chief’s trip to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being delayed due to travel safety concerns (See post at 09:34). The head of Russian-installed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, also said the trip was delayed. “We will wait for Grossi at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 15 June, the visit is delayed by a day,” he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the trip had been pushed back, possibly by days, Reuters reports. Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-installed local official as saying Grossi would visit on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russian military forces of attacking a car near the two countries’ shared border, and killing six people. Writing on Telegram, Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said the attack happened on Tuesday in the Sumy region, in eastern Ukraine. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Moscow is yet to officially comment on the allegations. The International Committee on the Red Cross, under ferocious criticism from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitted the principles of neutrality under which it operates have been put under unprecedented strain by the Ukraine war. It also defended the quality of its response to the floods caused by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, saying it had been working tightly with the Ukrainian Red Cross to coordinate efforts to supply drinking water. Juerg Eglin, ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, also revealed that Russia was continuing to refuse to give the body access to the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, where the ICRC estimates that most of the 50,000 people affected by the floods are living. Refusing to share the Russian explanation for refusing to grant access since the discussions were not over, he said: “We are ready to intervene on both sides of the river and have made concrete requests.” The ICRC said hundreds of thousands had been affected in a different way upstream of the dam, and that the risk of mines was becoming a growing threat to the civilian population. He added that ICRC staff were working under the risk of shelling. More broadly, the ICRC said it had now visited 1,500 prisoners from both sides, and that the visits had led to improvements in conditions in Russia. It had also delivered 2,500 messages between prisoners and relatives. Defending the ICRC from Zelenskiy’s longstanding criticism, the organisation said the principles under which it operates were not always understood. Ariane Bauer, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and central Asia, said: “The current environment we are in is extremely mediatised. Our efforts are not always visible. Our discrete approach can sometimes seem out of sync with today’s realities of today’s information space. “Neutrality and trust remain central to meeting our objectives and they cannot be dissociated one from another. Remaining neutral means we stick to our principles – the very principles that help people that need our support. “Remaining neutral shows that we care for the mandate we were given by states that were signatory to the Geneva convention. We have seen neutrality under strain and misunderstood in this conflict and many others, but perhaps more in this than others. For us, neutrality is not a moral position, it is a tool that helps us work and get access to prisoners of war and populations in hard-to-reach areas.” She refused to comment on whether Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia were in worse conditions than Russians held in Ukraine, but said improvements in conditions in Russia had followed ICRC visits to Russia. Russia had also cooperated with the ICRC by setting up lists of named prisoners held under its authority, she said. The water receded by another 32cm in the Kherson Region, in southern Ukraine, overnight, but 28 de-occupied settlements are still flooded, the Kyiv Post cited the regional military administration as saying on Wednesday morning. In the early hours on Tuesday last week, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army’s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a “terrorist act”. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what it said was “extremely fierce” fighting Reuters reports. In a post on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said the Ukrainian actions had had “partial” success. In the past day, Ukrainian troops advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the small eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, she said. She reported continuing fighting near the village of Makarivka in the direction of the southern port city of Berdiansk, and said battles were raging in the areas of Novodanylivka and Novopokrovsk in the Mariupol direction. Maliar said: Our troops are moving in the face of extremely fierce fighting, and air and artillery superiority of the enemy. If you haven’t already seen it, this stark piece from our colleague Lorenzo Tondo is well worth a read … The war in Ukraine has driven the largest annual increase of people forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations in decades, according to the UN refugee agency. In 2022, the number of displaced people grew by 21%, standing at an estimated 108.4 million at the end of the year. That is likely have risen to more than 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia’s invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR. “These figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. Wagner chief reiterates refusal to sign contracts with Russian defence ministry Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin on Wednesday reiterated the refusal of his Wagner fighters to sign contracts with the defence ministry, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the agreements were needed. In a rare direct show of defiance towards the Russian leader, Prigozhin said: “None of Wagner’s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. That’s why they will not sign the contracts.” In a televised meeting on Tuesday, Putin backed a call by the defence ministry for “volunteer” fighters in Ukraine to sign contracts with the country’s military command, widely seen as a means to assert control over Wagner. Putin said that contracts were necessary to allow all participants in Russia’s campaign in Ukraine to receive the social support payments to which they are entitled. These include compensation to fighters if they are wounded, and to their families if they are killed in action. Prigozhin has waged a bitter public feud with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the army top brass since last year, accusing them of failing to provide adequate support and ammunition to Wagner forces in Ukraine and so causing them to suffer higher casualties. In Wednesday’s remarks, however, he said he thought a “compromise solution” would be found between Putin and parliament to enable Wagner fighters to receive social guarantees and certified status as combatants. (Via Reuters) More here on the missing Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov … Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has made a bizarre appeal for information from Ukrainian intelligence over the location of Adam Delimkhanov, his right hand man and a member of the Russian state Duma. The message on Kadyrov’s official Telegram account followed reports of a strike on Delimkhanov’s convoy in the Zaporizhzhia region which is at the heart of the Ukrainian counter offensive. Kadyrov writes: “I myself can’t find Adam Delimkhanov in any way. He doesn’t get in touch. I ask Ukrainian intelligence to provide information on exactly what place and what positions were hit, so that I can still find my dear BROTHER. I promise a generous reward and I ask you to help.” Russia’s defence ministry quoted the State Duma as confirming Delimkhanov had been injured but they provided no further information. Kyrylo Sazonov, a Ukrainian military blogger, has claimed on his Facebook account that Delimkhanov was killed in an attack near the city of Prymorsk, west of Mariupol, after Ukrainian intelligence had spotted a motorcade of SUVs. He writes: “There were no wounded... All the bodies were taken away by helicopters. They arrived in half an hour.” Senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces in Ukraine has been wounded – report A senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine has been wounded, Russia’s defence ministry television channel Zvezda reported on Wednesday, citing the press service of the state Duma, the lower house of parliament. Adam Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. In a message posted on Telegram, Kadyrov wrote that he could not contact Delimkhanov, and asked for help finding his “dear brother”. Delimkhanov, a former Chechen separatist who eventually switched sides to Moscow along with much of the region’s leadership, had taken a prominent role in Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, commanding Chechen forces in Mariupol in the conflict’s early days. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian media reported that Delimkhanov had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. (Via Reuters) Reuters has a useful explainer on the Russian tactical nuclear weapons that are to be stationed in Belarus, and which the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, mentioned earlier (see here). Putin said that “tactical” nuclear weapons – so called as they are designed for battlefield use – would be sent to Belarus, but did not say exactly which warheads would be deployed or where. Lukashenko said the warheads were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Hiroshima bomb, made from highly enriched uranium-235, was about 16 kilotons (equivalent to 16,000 tonnes of TNT), while the Nagasaki bomb, made from plutonium-239, was about 21 kilotons, according to the World Nuclear Association. If Lukashenko is correct, the Russian warheads would have a yield of about 48 to 63 kilotons each. Russia has about 1,816 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to analysis of Russia’s nuclear weapons by Bulletin of Atomic Scientists magazine. Putin said Iskander mobile short-range ballistic missiles, which can deliver nuclear warheads, had already been handed over to Belarus. Russian sources say the Iskander has a range of 500km (310 miles). Putin also said 10 Belarusian aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. Belarus said Su-25 aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. The Sukhoi-25 jet has a range of up to 1,000km (621 miles), according to Russian sources. The Federation of American Scientists has said the weapons could be based at Lida airbase, 40km (25 miles) from the Lithuanian border. If so, the delivery vehicles could reach most of Ukraine, almost all of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, a swathe of Germany, as well as some of Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Cities such as Berlin and Stockholm would be in range. Putin said Russia would finish the construction of a special storage facility in Belarus on 7-8 July and that the weapons would be deployed soon afterwards. Lukashenko has made different comments. He seemed to indicate last month that the weapons were already on the move while on 13 June he said the weapons would be deployed in “several days”. He has also said that there could be “nuclear weapons for everyone” who joined the Russia-Belarus union. In a video published on 14 June, Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Germany is aiming to reduce its dependence on commodities through diversification of supply, and to create incentives for firms to hold strategic reserves, according to a summary of its new national security strategy. The strategy, which is expected to be published in full later on Wednesday, comes a year and a half after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which exposed Germany’s reliance on Russia for energy. It also contains a commitment for Germany to spend an average of 2% of economic output on defence, according to the summary – a weaker pledge, however, than the one made by chancellor Olaf Scholz days after the Russian invasion in a landmark speech heralding a “turning of era” or Zeitenwende in German foreign policy. Scholz had said Germany would start to invest more than 2% of economic output on defence, up from about 1.5%, after years of resisting pleas from Nato allies to do so. (Via Reuters) Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, has shared a video which purports to be an interview with a woman who was trapped under rubble after a Russian strike overnight, whose husband did not survive the attack. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. Grossi had been expected to visit the facility on Wednesday after talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, but a diplomatic source said the visit would be delayed by “some hours”. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-imposed local official as saying Grossi would visit the plant on Thursday. “He’s waiting to be able to travel safely,” said the senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official did not say when Grossi would arrive at the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Here are some more images from the news wires showing the damage in Odesa, where at least three people have been killed and 13 wounded. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio. Reuters reports that Mats Ljungqvist, the prosecutor leading the Swedish investigation, told Swedish Radio he had met the German prosecutor and that they were working together but declined to give further details. “I hope that we at least this autumn will be able to make a decision regarding indictments, at least that is the ambition as things stand now,” Ljungqvist told Swedish public service broadcaster SR. “I think, actually, in time, [who carried out the sabotage] will be brought to light.” Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group. Ljungqvist told Reuters in April that the main scenario was that a state or a state-backed group was behind the attack. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reports, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva. Navalny, Putin’s best-known opponent, is serving sentences totalling more than 11 years in a penal colony for fraud and other charges that he says were trumped up to silence him. He faces further “extremism” charges that could extend his term by decades. Human rights groups and western governments view Navalny as a political prisoner. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has used the strike on Odesa to reiterate Ukraine’s frequent calls for a tightening of economic sanctions on Russia. In a post on Telegram, he said: The Russians shelled the city with Kalibr cruise missiles. Civilians died. Each of these missiles has at least 40 foreign components. Without microelectronics, Russia will not be able to produce them. Sanctions must be strengthened, in particular, against those who help the terrorist country to obtain components for weapons. A planned visit by the UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been delayed by “some hours”, a diplomatic source has told Reuters. No reason has been given for the delay. Suspilne reports that the number of people killed due to the rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday has increased to 12. Citing the city authority, it said a 67-year-old wounded man died in the hospital overnight. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and currently deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has said on Telegram that Russia needs to put in a demilitarised zone as far west as Ukraine’s Lviv, which he referred to by its Russian name Lvov and German name Lemberg. He went on to say that, as a result of the Nord Stream sabotage, for which he cited “western complicity”, that Russia should have “no restrictions left to refrain from destroying the cable communications of our enemies, laid along the ocean floor”. Here are some images released by the emergency services in Ukraine showing the aftermath of strikes in Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region. Three people have been killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. It cites the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. He stated that the attack happened at 5am local time (3am BST). The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It claims: In the last two weeks, there has been an uptick in Russian tactical combat air sorties, especially over southern Ukraine. This has almost certainly been in response to reports of increased Ukrainian offensive operations, as the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) attempt to support ground troops with airstrikes. Despite the uptick, VKS’ daily sortie rate remains much lower than the peak of up to 300 daily missions early in the war. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Last week the Kakhovka dam in the city was destroyed, flooding swaths of land and forcing thousands to flee one of the biggest environmental disasters in Europe for decades. The administration also said that shelling of the nearby village of Plodovoye disrupted power supply there. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Ukraine and Russia deny targeting civilians in their military operations. Each side has accused the other of shelling the flooded areas in the aftermath of the dam blast. Separately, the administration said 7,200 people had been evacuated from the flooded areas in the past week, including 421 children. – Reuters The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. On Tuesday, Lukashenko said “everything is ready” for the Russian nuclear weapons’ deployment, adding that “it could take just a few days for us to get what we had asked for and even a bit more”. Asked later by a Russian state TV host whether Belarus had already received some of the weapons, Lukashenko responded: “Not all of them, little by little.” He appeared to confirm that his government had taken possession of some weapons from Russia and added that they were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. God forbid I have to make a decision to use those weapons today, but there would be no hesitation if we face an aggression. But in a later media appearance on Russian TV on Tuesday, he clarified he would consult with Putin before using any of the weapons. Listen, if a war starts, do you think I will look around? I pick up the phone, and wherever he is, he picks it up. If he calls, I pick it up any time. It’s no problem at all to coordinate launching a strike. Russian officials had no immediate comment on Lukashenko’s remarks. – AP The International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to “make his own assessment” on the risks posed to the operation by the war in Ukraine. Before his site visit, Grossi met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night to discuss the issue after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which formed a reservoir that provided cooling water for the plant. Speaking to journalists before his visit, Grossi said the situation complicated “an already precarious nuclear safety and security situation”. It is a step in the wrong direction, it is yet another step in the weakening of the safety net that one has in any nuclear power plant. Grossi said he would assess the integrity of the station’s water channels and cooling pond, and clarify whether the pond has been mined. I would say – again without having visited and on the basis of what my team there is informing me – there will be water (in the pond) for a few weeks, or maybe a month or two. There is no immediate situation: there is water there, but it could be going down. He also said that even if the reservoir empties “there are alternatives” such as pumping in water or drilling for groundwater. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. The warehouse of a retail chain was also hit in the attack, causing a fire to break out. Work is under way to clear the debris and a search is taking place for people trapped under the rubble. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured during a missile attack on the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Authorities say the attack struck civilian infrastructure in the southern port city and work is under way to pick through the rubble in the search for survivors. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss risks to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant before a planned visit to the facility. After the meeting, Grossi told journalists that he planned to travel to the plant on Wednesday so he could “make [his] own assessment” as to “what kind of danger we have”. Zelenskiy has praised the courage of Ukrainian troops during the early stages of his country’s counteroffensive and singled out units operating near the besieged city of Bakhmut, saying: “There is forward movement in various areas.” Zelenskiy also praised several other units, thanking them “for your strength”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed that Ukrainian losses during the conflict were near “catastrophic” and that the counterattack had not been successful in any area. The Russian president made the claim during televised meetings with war correspondents and military bloggers. “This is a massive counteroffensive, using strategic reserves that were prepared for this task,” Putin said. “They lost over 160, we lost 54 tanks, and some of them are subject to restoration and repair.” In other news: Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country won’t hesitate to use Russian nuclear weapons in the event his country is threatened with repression. The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously on a resolution calling for Russia to immediately release the imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Moscow has flagged that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin said he had been cheated by the west, who had failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets. A Russian missile strike on a block of flats in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine has killed 11 and injured more than 30 people, according to an updated casualty list provided by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. The US president, Joe Biden, has met Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg before a major meeting of the alliance next month in Lithuania where questions about Ukraine’s membership are expected to be addressed. The US government has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $325m which includes artillery rounds, anti-aircraft systems and 15 new Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The UK Ministry of Defence has announced a $115m air defence package for Ukraine. Latvia has allocated another $460,000 in aid to Ukraine after the Kakhova dam disaster. Ukrainian forces have been confirmed to have liberated the village of Neskuchne on Tuesday after Reuters journalists were able to reach the area. Russia has not yet acknowledge any gains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T12:00:37Z","webTitle":"Absolute power, misconduct and decline: the classical music pieces that unlock Tár","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","fields":{"bodyText":"Earlier this month, director Todd Field was interviewed for Radio 3’s Private Passions about his new film, Tár. The presenter Michael Berkeley had seen it the night before and commented: “It’s the kind of film you want to see with friends and have a good argument about. Is that perhaps what you wanted?” Field replied with a confident “yes” before bursting into laughter. At its root, Tár is a study of power. Field might have conjured up a ruthless politician to make his film about, but he chose to go one step higher – picking a figure of absolutism. It features Cate Blanchett in imperious form playing Lydia Tár, the first female chief conductor of one of the world’s top orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic. A real-life predecessor of the fictional Tár was Herbert von Karajan, who held the helm at the Berlin Philharmonic from 1956 until his death in 1989. Margaret Thatcher admired him greatly and they became friends, no matter that he was a former Nazi party member. “She envied me,” Karajan once said, “that people always did what I requested.” Much is left unsaid in Tár, resulting in a great deal of critical analysis. With regards to the music in the film – or, more specifically, the two works that Lydia Tár intends to conduct with her orchestra – there’s plenty to stew on, too. We hear in an opening scene that she intends to complete a cycle of Mahler’s nine symphonies (10 if you count his unfinished last symphony) by recording a live version of the Fifth. Needing a work to perform on the night alongside the Mahler, she opts for Elgar’s Cello Concerto, allowing her to promote her latest grooming victim, the young Russian cellist Olga Metkina (played by Sophie Kauer), from orchestra newbie to soloist. Tár seems to follow its protagonist’s descent from supreme power to near-irrelevance, her career and private life destroyed by a slew of allegations of misconduct. So why put Mahler’s Fifth at the heart of this psychodrama? Field told the LA Times that it was his “gateway drug into a lot of classical music”, but also that it fitted his narrative. Written in 1901–1902 and premiered in 1904, it’s a five-movement work beginning with a funeral march. “The first movement of the five is about death, and Lydia is undergoing a sort of artistic death, a personal death and a potential rebirth,” Field added. “It’s almost like it’s haunting her, coming for her.” The first movement alone clocks in at 12 or 13 minutes. In the film, there’s much discussion about the different lengths at which conductors play the famous fourth movement, the Adagietto (anywhere between seven and 12 minutes). In total, the symphony runs for well over an hour, pulling in many sonic and thematic directions. It’s a wide-open work, ripe for individual interpretation and impeccably suiting a film that doesn’t provide easy answers. Mahler said: “A symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.” He was caught on the cusp of the Romantic period in music and the forward charge of modernism. His symphonies both look back and drive onward, creating ambiguity, consciously and subconsciously. “Music, before Mahler, had a lexicon of simple emotions: joy, sorrow, love, hate, uplift, downcast, beauty, ugliness, and so on,” music critic Norman Lebrecht wrote in his 2010 book, Why Mahler? “Mahler, in his First Symphony, introduced the possibility of parallel meanings.” Mahler met and married his wife Alma, also a composer, while writing his Fifth symphony. The Adagietto is his love letter, but that’s not how it’s always perceived. In the film, Lydia Tár is portrayed as the protege of the American conductor Leonard Bernstein. In 1968, Bernstein conducted the Adagietto at Robert F Kennedy’s funeral – performing it like “a mass’’, as Tár says – which began the process of it becoming an American national anthem of mourning. Post-9/11, it was played repeatedly by orchestras and radio DJs across the US. After her brother-in-law’s funeral, Jackie Kennedy wrote to Bernstein: “When your Mahler started to fill (but that is the wrong word – because it was more this sensitive trembling) the cathedral today – I thought it was the most beautiful music I had ever heard. I am so glad I didn’t know it – it was this strange music of all the gods who were crying …” Such is the power of Mahler’s Fifth, a piece that becomes reborn each time new listeners stumble upon it. Field told Private Passions that the first time he heard the work he thought he’d “personally discovered it”. Mikhail Gorbachev, who first heard it in 1991, commented: “I had the feeling that Mahler’s music somehow touched our situation, about the period of perestroika with all its passions and struggles.” It’s an irony of both Mahler’s Fifth and Elgar’s Cello Concerto (1919) that they barely resonated when composed, percolated over time and then came into dazzling fruition in the 1960s. Bernstein was essential to Mahler’s success in the second half of the 20th century; Elgar has an English cellist, Jacqueline du Pré, to thank for turning a failure into a standard. Her electrifying, boundless 1965 performance of the concerto – recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by John Barbirolli when Du Pré was 20 – transcended genre. It hit the zeitgeist, sold like a pop record and made a star of Du Pré. Her death in 1987, aged 42, after multiple sclerosis had ended her performing career 14 years earlier, remains one of English classical music’s most appalling tragedies. In Tár, the blackly comic character of Olga Metkina says she was introduced to the Elgar Cello Concerto by Du Pré, but through a live performance on YouTube, not the recording. There is a correlation between the free-spirited natures of Metkina and Du Pré, but you guess also that Field specifically needed Elgar’s Cello Concerto in his film. Like Mahler’s Fifth, it’s a wildly popular piece frequently used by Hollywood, thereby providing a reachable access point for anyone new to classical music. But perhaps there’s further intent on Field’s part. Like Tár, whose affection for the old masters is scoffed at by progressive students in a class she teaches at New York’s Juilliard school, so Elgar was written off as stuffy, reactionary and provincial – later in his own career and in the decades that followed his death in 1934. By the time Elgar began writing his Cello Concerto in the aftermath of the first world war, he was already considered old-hat and he knew it. Furthermore, the carnage of war had affected him deeply and his beloved wife Alice was ill (she would soon die). He was lonely, depressed and he wouldn’t go on to write another major orchestral work. Later, when preparing a catalogue of his music, he wrote “Finis RIP” next to the Concerto, although he lived for 15 more years and published many more, smaller pieces. The plaintive, autumnal concerto is considered to be a lament for war, but perhaps Elgar was writing a requiem for his own death. In that sense, it couldn’t more perfectly suit Field’s narrative arc for Lydia Tár as she unwittingly orchestrates her own demise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T19:26:57Z","webTitle":"Dykes scores hat-trick on league debut as London Irish power past Harlequins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"London Irish already have an impressive roster of exciting young English-qualified talent and another name can now be added to the list. Michael Dykes has plenty of good rugby ahead of him but an alert hat-trick of tries on his Premiership debut ensured he overshadowed even the fit-again Henry Arundell on a highly encouraging day for the Exiles. There are fruit machines that revolve slower than the helter-skelter games in which Irish specialise but here there was also a decent pay-out to enjoy as they bolstered their chances of a top-four finish with a convincing bonus-point victory. If a first-half red card for the Quins captain, Stephan Lewies, significantly shaped the contest, the hosts fully deserved their six-try success. Along with the energy of the 21-year-old Dykes, who is from Berkshire and has already represented England at age-group level, the sight of Arundell back on a rugby field for the first time since late October was another clear plus for the Exiles in a season which has too often involved narrow defeats and red cards. England, with Henry Slade now out with a hip injury, have recalled Leicester’s Anthony Watson to their Six Nations squad but the Irish head coach, Les Kiss, suggested Arundell would also be ready if and when he is required. “I wouldn’t be afraid to throw him in,” Kiss said. “The boy’s got something special.” Here, too, was a glimpse of what might yet be possible this season for Irish, who have now won four of their past five Premiership games. If a nasty-looking shoulder injury for the unlucky Adam Coleman was a blow, the obvious talent of the the Kiwi-reared Chandler Cunningham-South, still just 19 and part of England’s under-20 squad, Tom Pearson and their Argentinian replacement Juan Martin González bodes well for their play-off prospects. This was the Exiles’ biggest attendance of the season and once the grounds harden up in spring their attacking brand of rugby should be even more watchable. There was also the satisfaction of atoning for their last-gasp defeat against Quins at the end of October with the third-placed Exeter now only three points above them. As well as underlining the competitiveness of this year’s Premiership it also raised further questions about how Quins will fare over the Six Nations period without Marcus Smith and Alex Dombrandt to steer them around the field. “We’re a mid-table side, that’s the brutal reality,” the Quins director of rugby, Tabai Matson, said. Matson also did not dispute the 22nd-minute red card against Lewies, who on the face of it could have no complaints under the laws. His shoulder to the head of a stooping Cunningham-South looked worse with every slow-motion replay and there was no attempt to wrap the arm. Then again, tacklers are not technically supposed to have their heads below waist level, leaving the Quins captain with no real legal target at which to aim. So what was he meant to do? Matson is among those who believe this is the biggest conundrum now facing rugby’s beleaguered guardians. Dykes’s triple whammy, meanwhile, made him only the third player after Gloucester’s Lesley Vainokolo and Northampton’s Courtnal Skosan to score a hat-trick on his Premiership debut. Swift, elusive and with an eye for the line, Dykes had his first try on the board after just seven minutes, courtesy of some slick work inside him, as Quins went 14-0 down quicker than you could say “Not another slow start”. In addition to Cunningham-South’s early score, James Stokes was first to react to a loose ball to register Irish’s third before Dykes, having also served 10 minutes in the sin-bin for failing to intercept a looping ball which also led to a penalty try being awarded, underlined the promise he had shown previously with a hat-trick in a Premiership Cup game against Saracens. Even before Joe Marler departed to the sin-bin, leaving Quins with just 13 players for the final 10 minutes, it was a green day to savour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T19:16:44Z","webTitle":"China ‘increasingly disruptive global power’, says Canadian foreign minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/09/china-increasingly-disruptive-global-power-canadian-foreign-minister","fields":{"bodyText":"Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, has said China has become “increasingly disruptive” on the world stage as she hinted in a speech at a new Indo-Pacific strategy expected to be released this month. Her comments come ahead of several summits that Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is to attend, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Cambodia, the G20 in Indonesia, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Thailand. “China is an increasingly disruptive, global power,” Joly told a Toronto audience. “It seeks to shape the global environment into one that is more permissive for interests and values that increasingly depart from ours. “And China’s rise as a global actor is reshaping the strategic outlook of every state in the region, including Canada.” In an outline of Ottawa’s new policy strategy, which is due to be released in the coming weeks, Joly said it would be critical to expand relations with India and other countries in the region, as well as Taiwan. She did not discourage further trade with China, which has become Canada’s second-largest trading partner, despite strained diplomatic ties. But she warned Canadian firms they “need to be clear-eyed” about doing business in and with China. Her comments came days after Trudeau said that China is “play[ing] aggressive games” to undermine democratic institutions amid reports that Beijing had actively interfered in Canada’s federal elections. His comments on Monday came after reports that Beijing had funded a clandestine network of candidates in Canada’s 2019 election and just days after the federal police force said it was investigating a secret network of illegal Chinese police stations in Toronto. Bilateral relations soured after Canada’s 2018 arrest of a Huawei executive on a US warrant, and Beijing’s detention of two Canadians in apparent retaliation. All three were released last year as part of a deal with US prosecutors. Joly said Canada must continue to deal with China on global issues such as the climate crisis. Notably, China will chair a UN biodiversity conference in Montreal in December. But she promised Ottawa would be vocal on China’s poor treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities, its crushing of free speech in Hong Kong, military threats against Taiwan, and any moves to curtail international navigation rights in the region. She said: “We will challenge China when we ought to. We will cooperate with China when we must.” “The Indo-Pacific region is the epicenter of a generational global shift,” she added, predicting it will account for half of the global economy by 2040. Joly also noted an increased Canadian military presence in the Pacific and promised more staff at its embassies tasked with analysing the impact of Chinese policies. At global forums she said Canada and its allies will be “pushing back against behaviours that undermine international norms”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/19/new-york-taxes-super-wealthy-protest-towers-of-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T21:30:23Z","webTitle":"Tax the rich, urge protesters at New York City’s ‘Towers of Power’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/new-york-taxes-super-wealthy-protest-towers-of-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/19/new-york-taxes-super-wealthy-protest-towers-of-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Lawmakers and activists gathered in the rain on Thursday outside a Manhattan apartment building once dubbed the “Towers of Power” and famous for being the home of millionaires and billionaires, calling for higher state taxes on the super-wealthy. “I’m asking you now, help the people of New York City by sharing some of the wealth that you have,” the New York state senator Robert Jackson shouted up to the apartments above, most of which had their blinds drawn. “If not, we’re going to pass legislation that makes you pay for it.” The art deco co-op on the city’s Upper East Side has been home to dozens of wealthy financiers and celebrities since it opened in 1929. The building at 740 Park Avenue has been home to John D Rockefeller Jr, Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman, David Koch of the Koch brothers and Donald Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin. An apartment in the building currently on the market is going for $27.5m. Umbrellas up, outside the building, the lawmakers promised to fight to ensure the wealthy in New York are fairly taxed. “A little rain is not going to stop us and neither are decades of trickle-down economics,” said Jabari Brisport, a state senator. Lawmakers across seven states, including New York, are working together to introduce higher taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations in their respective legislatures. Along with New York, legislators from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland and Washington have been working on bills that would increase taxes for the wealthy living in their states. Many of the new proposals include taxes on the overall wealth of the rich, not just on their annual income. In 2021, ProPublica released a report based off a trove of tax documents from the wealthy that showed how the rich avoid paying income tax. It showed that in some years, the wealthiest billionaires sometimes avoided income tax altogether by holding and adding to their wealth through stock and property ownership, which are taxed at lower rates than income. Joe Biden introduced a 20% “wealth tax” at the federal level, which would apply toward an individual “total income”, including growth in their assets like stocks, when proposing his budget last spring. But with Republicans showing no interest in wealth taxes, progressives are hoping that taxes on the super wealthy can happen at the state level. In New York, progressive lawmakers are looking to pass the Invest in New York package, which will include a slate of tax reforms on extreme wealth. The tax reform includes adding new tax brackets for the highest earners, higher corporate taxes for the wealthiest companies and wealth taxes on capital gains, including unrealized capital gains, and inheritance. Over a dozen state senators have signed on to the proposal. “We are tired of subsidizing billionaires here in New York. For a long time, we see how they underpay employees at work and then at home, the workers who help them are also unpaid,” said state senator Jessica Ramos, who is proposing a tax on unrealized capital gains. “When that happens, we end up having to step up with services to help those families make ends meet.” State senator Gustavo Rivera, who is proposing higher taxes on long-term capital gains, said the lawmakers are unconcerned about the wealthy leaving New York, a point often brought up by opponents of a wealth tax. “This notion that they will leave is not true. It does not happen. They live here, they have Broadway, they have restaurants, they have culture, they have Central Park. They’re not going to move,” Rivera said. Activists and lawmakers at Thursday’s rally called on the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to work with them to pass higher wealth taxes. Hochul last month said she did not think raising taxes “makes sense” after the state passed tax cuts, primarily aimed at the middle class, last year. “I don’t believe that raising taxes, at a time when we just cut taxes, makes sense,” she said in December. “We are not going to turn around and say last year we lowered your taxes, now we are raising them. So, I don’t foresee that.” Thursday’s rally and the unveiling of the wealth taxes across the blue states coincided with Wednesday’s release of a letter from 205 members of the global super-rich elite who called on governments around the world to “tax us, the ultra rich, now”. The letter signers, including Abigail Disney and actor Mark Ruffalo, urged lawmakers to “tackle extreme wealth” via taxes. “Defending democracy and building cooperation requires action to build fairer economies to build fairer economies right now – it is not a problem that can be left for our children to fix,” the letter said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-spoken-word-poets-powerful-voices-that-are-needed-today","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-07T17:25:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on spoken word poets: powerful voices that are needed today | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-spoken-word-poets-powerful-voices-that-are-needed-today","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-spoken-word-poets-powerful-voices-that-are-needed-today","fields":{"bodyText":"News that one of the UK’s leading poetry prizes is introducing a category for spoken word artists is as welcome as it is overdue. The move by the Forward prizes signals that the poetry establishment is finally finding a way to honour a sector that it has traditionally regarded as a cuckoo in its nest, when in fact it has long been a fully fledged skylark. This prejudice has done poetry itself no favours, by excluding not only some of the most powerful voices of the last half century, but also those most likely to draw big new audiences into its thrall. For three decades, the Forward prizes have stood alongside the TS Eliot awards as proof that poetry still matters. Each year, both sets of awards fill London’s 2,700-seater Festival Hall for winners’ ceremonies that are also performances, celebrating the art form in its most ancient iteration as something to be heard and shared. In this context, it has always seemed ironic that it has had no room for the culture-shifting polemics of, say, Linton Kwesi Johnson or Benjamin Zephaniah, or of a younger generation who, like George the Poet, are capable of reeling in a Glastonbury crowd. This is not to deny that the Forward prizes’ existing portfolio of best collection, best single poem and best debut collection has built up a formidable library of winners over the last 31 years. They stretch from Thom Gunn’s great Aids era memorial, The Man with Night Sweats, to Kim Moore’s zeitgeisty poems of everyday sexism, All the Men I Never Married, and include works by three poet laureates. It would also be wrong to claim that there is a complete separation between poetry for page and stage: after all, one of this year’s Forward judges, Joelle Taylor, is a former UK slam champion who last year won the TS Eliot prize. This raises the question of whether it is necessary, or even desirable, to create a spoken word niche at all today, or if it is just a matter of waiting until poets who found their voice on the spoken word scene, such as Ms Taylor, or 2020’s TS Eliot winner, Roger Robinson, are ready to commit their words to print. But to make that argument is to assume that there is a hierarchy – a growing-up process – when in fact there are plenty of poets who work simultaneously in both arenas. As Ms Taylor rightly pointed out: “Spoken word and performed poetry is as valuable, dynamic and exploratory as published works.” Though it is intrinsic to the very nature of oral poetry that it has a light archival footprint, it nevertheless has a long pedigree. That lineage stretches back to the Harlem renaissance via the 1960s, when Beat heavyweights such as Allen Ginsberg electrified a 7,000-strong audience at the Royal Albert Hall, and Roger McGough, Adrian Henri and Brian Patten emerged as the Liverpool Poets. That some of the cultural and political excitement of poetry in that reformative era has resurfaced in the last few years is largely due to public performance, from Amanda Gorman’s The Hill We Climb, which stole the hearts of millions at the inauguration of Joe Biden, to Kae Tempest’s redefinition of the relationship between poetry, music and theatre. A new mechanism for bringing this energy into the classical canon, holding it in parallel and capturing it for posterity, can only be enriching."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T12:51:10Z","webTitle":"Rishi Sunak’s AI summit: what is its aim, and is it really necessary?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/09/rishi-sunak-ai-summit-what-is-its-aim-and-is-it-really-necessary","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has announced that the UK will host a global summit on safety in artificial intelligence in the autumn, as fears grow that the technology’s rapid advancement could spin out of control.

Here is a look at what the summit might achieve. What is the aim of the summit? The prime minister has changed his tone on AI in recent weeks. Having been overwhelmingly optimistic about the opportunities it creates, he has begun to talk about its “existential risks”. Sunak is trying to position the UK as the natural hub for efforts to regulate the industry on a global scale, one that can provide a bridge between the US and China, and to offer an alternative to what some consider to be the EU’s heavy-handed approach. Described as the “first major global summit on AI safety”, the government says it will consider the risks the technology poses and discuss how they can be mitigated through “internationally coordinated action”. Is internationally coordinated action needed? Industry professionals harbour concerns about AI and have issued warnings about the dangers it poses. Elon Musk was one of more than 50,000 signatories to a letter in March that called for an immediate pause in the development of “giant” AIs, alongside the creation of “robust AI governance systems”. Concern about a possible existential threat from a system that human intervention cannot control by human intervention is not universal though. Many in the tech industry argue that the focus should be more immediate, for instance by focusing on the potential for generative AI, which can provide plausible imitations of text, images and voice that could produce destabilising disinformation during elections. What would a global framework look like? The UN-brokered treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which came into force in 1970, is an example of a global attempt to mitigate an existential threat. The treaty, to which 191 states are signatories, commits countries that have nuclear weapons to not helping non-nuclear weapon states acquire or build such military technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency oversees compliance through inspections. The treaty also promotes the spread of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The letter calling for a six-month pause in AI development offers an insight into what might go into such a framework. It calls for dedicated regulatory authorities, public funding for safety research, and oversight and tracking of powerful systems. Would a nuclear arms-style framework succeed with AI? As with nuclear weapons, the technology that such a framework would seek to contain is already out there and proliferating. The chatbot phenomenon ChatGPT reached 100 million users within two months of its launch and a now-famous fake image of the pope wearing a Balenciaga jacket has underlined the power of generative AI to deceive. One of Google’s engineers warned last month that the company could lose out to open-source AI technology. Such developers release their work for anyone to use, improve or adapt as they see fit, making it difficult for a framework to curb the use of open-source models. China is likely to be excluded from the UK summit, which will be open to technology companies and “like-minded countries”. This indicates that an international framework to place guardrails around AI development will not have the participation of a global tech and AI powerhouse. What is happening in AI regulation already? The EU has made significant strides in the area and is proposing legislation that will be seen a pacesetter for AI regulation, confirming the bloc’s status as a leading tech regulator. The UK’s AI white paper sets out a set of principles to which the industry should adhere, but offers little in the way of concrete rules to govern it. Ministers disappointed some experts by resisting the idea of creating a new regulator to focus exclusively on AI. The G7 has agreed to create an intergovernmental forum called the “Hiroshima AI process” to debate issues around fast-growing tools."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-23T07:00:28Z","webTitle":"Putin’s nuclear threat shows a desperate man out of options | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/23/putins-nuclear-threat-shows-a-desperate-man-out-of-options","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin is ready to use a nuclear weapon in his ongoing attempt to conquer Ukraine. Or so says Vladimir Putin. The reason is that his conquest has been justly defeated so far and he sees no other way forward. The prospect of such an escalation is appalling. A line would be crossed. Nuclear-armed powers round the world would regard it as a licence. It might not be the end of the world, but it might just be the beginning of the end. For all the cheerleading of western politicians over Putin’s humiliation, it is crucial to emphasise how disciplined has been the west’s support for Kyiv. Yes, Nato took a gamble in advancing its borders eastwards after 1991, George Kennan’s “most fateful error of the post-cold war era”. It taunted Russia’s paranoia and risked the emergence of a belligerent patriot, which is what happened in the case of Putin. But at no point has the west taken up arms against Russia, even when Russia successively attacked and “repatriated” areas of neighbouring Georgia, Chechnya and even Ukraine. Moscow’s spring invasion of Ukraine was on a wholly different scale from the 2014 intrusion into Donbas. It was so blatant and brutal that outside military support for Kyiv was as much humanitarian as strategic. But from the start, Nato did nothing to substantiate Moscow’s lie that the west had taken up arms against Russian territory. There were to be no long-range missiles, no bombers or western troops fighting on the ground. Only with economic sanctions did the west lend plausibility to Putin’s claim that it was attacking Russia itself. Putin has done his nation much harm. He has revealed his army as a Potemkin farce, his generals as incompetent sycophants. Many of his people, proud Russians long supportive of his bombast, are now openly hostile to his mobilisation. Polls show that a quarter to a half of Russians oppose the war. Only the spectacular discomfort caused to the west by Moscow’s retaliatory gas sanctions has afforded the Kremlin some respite. Otherwise Putin is bereft of options. Like many a commander forced into retreat, he is tormented by the choice of escalation or abject defeat. During the cold war, Europe’s civilians were taught how to respond to a potential thermonuclear exchange. The horror of “mutual assured destruction” was so ingrained it fed through into great-power diplomacy and created an infrastructure of back channels and accident aversion. The merest hint of danger, as during the Cuban crisis in 1962 and a radar malfunction in 1983, brought a swift return to sanity. There is no reason – or should be no reason – to see the present crisis as a return to the cold war and nuclear confrontation. Great powers are not in existential contention. Even Putin is threatening only tactical nuclear weapons. Given the weakness of his forces on the ground, it is hard to see what gain such weapons would bring him in what is a conventional infantry war over territory. They would be a gesture, and one that would surely lose him support both at home and abroad among his putative admirers in China and India. As for a nuclear “response” from the west, it would serve no tactical purpose and merely open the gates to escalation. We are told that if Putin was to fall, even “harder-line” figures within his circle would replace him. Russia is like all regimes under sanctions. Besieged elites drive opponents and moderates underground or into exile. They become entrenched and ever less vulnerable to diplomacy and economic pressure. Yet all wars must end. Russia’s in Ukraine has been going on for eight years and has increasingly taken on the colours of a proxy conflict of west against east. Therein lies the danger of Putin’s escalation. Western aid has enabled Ukraine to drive Russia’s troops back towards the 2014 frontiers. Ukraine and the west have been united in defying a brutal and authoritarian regime, and have been largely successful. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, now risks that unity by stating that he wants ever more western aid to drive Russia out of all of Ukraine, including Crimea. While his cause remains just, there must come a point when a war to conquer all of Ukraine becomes one of where to draw a line of armistice, as with Russia’s infringements of its neighbours’ sovereignty in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and Donbas. At some point, perhaps after one more forceful Ukrainian drive eastwards, there must come a different effort, to encourage the parties to agree a peace. Recent deals on wheat exports and prisoner exchanges show there are channels in place. That will mean a new challenge. The world of compromises, plebiscites, borders and guarantees may be less dramatic than that of guns, bombs, tanks and drums. But it has to be the world of the future. It has to presage the rebuilding of Ukraine. There is no conceivable interest in reviving the horrors of nuclear conflict between east and west just because one Russian ruler took leave of his senses.

It also enables producers of power to match their output to times of peak demand and so command the highest prices, boosting profits. However, climate change is making the whole process much more difficult. Extreme weather events – high winds, heatwaves, freezing rain, and loss of glaciers and snow pack mean once reliable sources of power can fail. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says 87% of global electricity comes from nuclear, hydro and thermal fossil fuel plants that rely on water for cooling, and up to a third of these are in high water stress areas. Predicting droughts, stream flows and water availability is therefore vital for maintaining supply. For solar and wind, where water is less of an issue, predicting wind strength and sunshine hours is key. In countries with highly variable weather, such as the UK, this is still a work in progress, although improving all the time. Partly, these problems can be mitigated by giant batteries and well-tried technologies, such as pump storage, where water is pumped back uphill at night for hydro-power production at peak times. But even without Russia cutting gas flows to Europe, keeping power supplies stable in a changing climate is an increasing challenge everywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-03T15:15:54Z","webTitle":"Poor households face having to help foot bill for building Sizewell C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government has been criticised for exposing low-income households to the cost of building the Sizewell C nuclear power plant while letting factories “off the hook” as a crucial planning decision is due this week. If given the green light, the government hopes to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model to finance the project, which is being proposed by the French energy firm EDF. RAB reduces the risk to investors, who will receive regular payments before the project begins generating power. However, it also means customers pay for the construction costs through higher energy bills. A consultation on using the RAB model is due to close next month and shows operators in energy-intensive industries would be exempt but households receiving universal credit would have to pay. In the consultation, officials said the exemption for electricity-intensive users – such as factories – would avoid the risk of putting them at a “significant competitive disadvantage” when operating in international markets as they may have to add the costs to the price of their products. MPs had suggested electricity suppliers should be prevented from recovering the costs of their RAB payment obligations from consumers who are on universal credit. However, officials rejected this idea, saying such a measure could “disincentivise suppliers from engaging in commercially beneficial practices” such as payment plans and loyalty benefits to attract customers. They also argued other vulnerable consumers not claiming universal credit could also be affected by the move. The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “When energy bills are skyrocketing right in the middle of a cost of living scandal, the last thing that people can afford is the ballooning cost of embryonic nuclear white elephants like Sizewell C. “Not only are these projects extremely expensive to build in the first place, with Hinkley Point C now at £26bn without having generated a single watt of energy, the RAB business model passes that enormous upfront cost directly on to the consumer. While giant companies are spared with generous exemptions, the very worst-off in society will be footing the bill. Nuclear is too slow, too expensive and the wrong priority.” The 3.2 gigawatt plant at Sizewell in Suffolk could be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes and is part of a project to approve a nuclear reactor each year by 2030. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “Taxes of any kind hit the poorest hardest and this nuclear tax is no exception. Multimillion-pound businesses will be let off the hook if they use a lot of energy but a family on universal credit struggling to afford its heating bills will have to cough up to pay for an unwanted nuclear power station.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the government considerd it very important to support low-income households but believed that “support for vulnerable groups would be best tackled holistically” by looking at the factors driving up energy bills. BEIS has estimated that Sizewell C would add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12. In January, the government earmarked £100m to advance Sizewell C to the next stage of negotiations, and help the project attract further private investment. In May, it pushed back the deadline for a decision on a “development consent order” for Sizewell C from 25 May to 8 July. Ministers have tasked Barclays to lead a search for investors to back the project alongside the government and EDF, which each plan to take a 20% stake. That structure would force out CGN, the state-backed Chineses nuclear specialist that has a 20% stake in Sizewell C venture. According to the Mail on Sunday, the British Gas owner, Centrica, is considering taking a stake. CGN has partnered with EDF on the Hinkley Point C in Somerset – which has been delayed and is over budget – but ministers want to avoid further Chinese involvement amid worsening relations between the UK and China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-02T09:54:51Z","webTitle":"Labour stays on course for power with Chester byelection victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/dec/02/labour-stays-on-course-for-power-with-chester-byelection-victory","fields":{"bodyText":"For several months, nervous Labour MPs have looked at the national polls and asked themselves whether their commanding leads can really be trusted. On Thursday night, voters in Chester gave them, at least for now, an answer: yes. Thursday’s thumping byelection victory, with Labour winning its highest ever majority in the seat in a 14-point vote swing, suggests the party would win a comfortable majority if a general election were held today. It provides further evidence Labour is rebuilding support in the so-called red wall of northern seats, many of which it lost at the last election. Sir John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told the BBC on Friday morning the result suggested the opposition party was heading for a “favourable” majority. “This is consistent with the claim that a) Labour are in a stronger position than they’ve ever been in the last 12 years; and b) the performance is consistent with what happened last time we had the defeat of a Conservative government,” he said. One Labour source said: “This is a phenomenal result for us, a landslide, bigger even than 1997 [when the party won 53% of the vote]. These are the kinds of seats we need to be winning if we are to show we are on course for a general election victory.” The seat is not the marginal it once was. In 2015, Labour won by just 93 votes, but the party won sizeable majorities at the two elections since. Nevertheless, the party went into the byelection against a difficult backdrop. The vote was called after Chris Matheson resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. Labour officials said, however, that the controversy had not been a big issue on the doorstep, where voters were keener to talk about the economy, as well as more local issues such as Chester high street. Samantha Dixon, the new Labour MP, said during her acceptance speech that she had been greeted on the doorstep by one voter who was wrapped in blankets after her energy bills rose by hundreds of pounds. For the Conservatives, the result gives some tentative signs that the electorate is not as hostile to the party as it was in the final days of Liz Truss’s premiership, when Labour enjoyed national poll leads of more than 30 points. But if the party hoped Rishi Sunak’s leadership might help restore the voter coalition that propelled it to election victory in 2019, there is little sign of that. Andy Carter, the Tory MP for Warrington South, told the Telegraph on Thursday night: “We are mid-term in what has been an incredibly challenging parliamentary term on the back of Covid, a war in Ukraine where prices have shot up.” He added: “We’ve got two years until the next general election … I think [Rishi Sunak] has been in the job for five weeks doing a great job tackling inflation.” If Sunak wanted more time to be able to prove himself to voters, he will not get it. The parties will contest two more byelections in north-west England in the coming weeks. The first will be in Stretford and Urmston on 15 December, and the second on an unconfirmed date in West Lancashire. Some Conservative MPs believe, however, that the result in Chester shows the situation is unsalvageable for the new prime minister. Sir Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, told Times Radio on Friday: “It’s almost impossible to see us coming back from this.” He added that the best Sunak could hope for at the next election would be to “win maybe 220 seats and form a viable opposition”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T05:36:23Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: How to make sense of Putin’s nuclear threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/22/thursday-briefing-vladimir-putin-russia-nuclear-war-threat-truss-biden","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Threats of nuclear war from Vladimir Putin are never likely to go unnoticed, and the Russian president’s speech yesterday is all over the front pages of British newspapers this morning. Putin said that “when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal” and added “It’s not a bluff”. That led to condemnations from both Joe Biden and Liz Truss at the United Nations general assembly, with Truss saying at 2am UK time that the Russian president’s “bogus claims” were simply about “trying to justify his catastrophic failures”. But there were other aspects of Putin’s speech that could turn out to be more consequential, from the suggestion that occupied Ukraine will soon be part of Russia to an announcement that hundreds of thousands of reservists will now be called up to the military. So how should we view Putin’s threats and the west’s response – and what impact will new military service obligations have in Russia? For today’s newsletter, I asked the Guardian’s foreign correspondent Peter Beaumont and world affairs editor Julian Borger to explain how they’re thinking about the answers to those questions. That’s after the rest of the headlines.

In depth: ‘You can see how this could turn out to be his Vietnam’ *** Why did Putin make this speech yesterday? Ukrainian officials have been expecting an escalation for some time, said Peter Beaumont. “Even when I was last in Ukraine a couple of months ago, they thought it was on the cards.” But with winter approaching – and with it the prospect of a forced pause in aggressive operations – alongside disastrous recent news for Russia in Kharkiv, where Ukraine has rapidly taken back control of about 6,000 sq km, it finally came. News of the mobilisation of military reservists and references to nuclear weapons can hardly be read as good news for Ukraine or its allies – but it does suggest “an awareness that actually the Kremlin can’t keep pretending things are going well in the ‘special operation’,” Peter said. As Keir Giles, a fellow of the Chatham House Russia and Eurasia programme, wrote in the Guardian yesterday: “The speech is a further recognition that Russia has been unable to win on the battlefield – so, to defeat Ukraine, it has to win elsewhere.” *** What does Putin want to achieve? While the most obviously alarming feature of Putin’s speech was his reference to nuclear weapons, it has to be understood through a subtler aspect of what he said: references to Russian “territorial integrity” and a new emphasis on attempts to frame his invasion as a defensive operation. The speech coincided with an announcement that four Russian-occupied regions will hold referendums this weekend on joining the Russian Federation – widely viewed as a sham pretext for annexation. “You cannot separate the two,” Peter said. “By claiming he is fighting a defensive war, Putin is trying to set the stage for annexing these regions, ‘freezing’ the conflict, and then declaring that they are now part of Russia and under the nuclear umbrella.” That is unlikely to persuade Ukraine to simply give up. “After all, they’ve already attacked Crimea, which is annexed Russia territory,” Peter said. Instead, “Putin wants the more cautious nations in the western coalition to think: ‘Are we going to be made to go too far?’ But I’m not sure that’s going to work. So far it appears to have just reinforced the view that this is a rogue regime.” *** How did Biden and Truss respond to the nuclear threat? Initially, at least, it doesn’t look as if saying “it’s not a bluff” has been as slam-dunk a proof of authenticity as Putin appears to have hoped. “It is a consequential thing, to talk about a nuclear attack, and you should never treat it as absurd,” said Peter. “But on balance you do have to think about it as a bluff, whatever he says. I don’t have that view of Putin as mad: he has acknowledged before that nuclear war is unthinkable and unfightable. And the Kremlin knows that any kind of nuclear escalation” – like exploding a warhead over the Black Sea – “would mean that the rest of the world, including China, saw this conflict in the west’s terms, not Russia’s terms.” That’s the context for Liz Truss’s and Joe Biden’s speeches at the United Nations general assembly, which acknowledged the gravity of Putin’s speech – but also insisted that his nuclear threats would not cause any rift. Truss accused Putin of “doubling down” but accused him of “sabre-rattling threats” and concluded: “This will not work.” Biden said Putin’s “overt nuclear threats against Europe” showed “a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime.” “It’s a delicate balance,” said Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor, speaking after Truss’ speech this morning. “And those were the briefings from the US – that we’re not going to be deterred, but we can see the dynamics of escalation and we’re not going to overplay our hand. The thinking is that they need to continue to lay down their own lines for what is acceptable and what is not, and ignore Putin’s – not to reward him for his sabre-rattling.” In practice, what that means is maintaining that an attack on Russian territory by Ukraine would not have western support – but that Putin’s attempt to define parts of Ukraine as Russian via sham referendums will not be accepted. *** How will it be received in Russia? While nuclear threats are bound to preoccupy western audiences, the announcement of a partial mobilisation is likely to have more impact at home. Bringing a new 300,000 troops into the conflict might sound ominous, but “it doesn’t actually make a huge amount of sense”, said Peter. “The most useful part is ensuring that contracted soldiers who had been planning to leave the military after six months stay in the campaign. And there’s a view that you can use these mobilised forces to take on jobs that combat soldiers are doing, and sharpen your capability on the frontlines. But it seems pretty fanciful to think they can easily absorb this many troops.” Ed Arnold, of the thinktank Rusi, tells Dan Sabbagh in this piece that “operationally, this won’t make any difference this year and probably not into next year ... the infrastructure isn’t there in terms of equipping that level of force at the moment.” Meanwhile, Peter said, the announcement “immediately creates a class of people whose view of the war is suddenly a lot more personal than it was before”. That is not likely to lead to outright rebellion, Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center says in this piece by Pjotr Sauer about the domestic reaction. “Russia’s repressed society will accept this obediently,” he said. “They will deal with the issue in their own practical way, avoiding the draft however they can.” But in the hours after Putin’s speech, more than 1,300 people had been arrested during anti-war protests in dozens of cities, according to the independent OVD-Info protest monitoring group. Another immediate index of that impact: direct flights to countries allowing Russians visa-free entry were sold-out on Wednesday morning, while searches for phrases like “how to break your arm” and “how to avoid the draft” rocketed. In this piece, Andrew Roth hears from some of the dismayed Russians who could be affected by the draft, one of whom says: “I’d rather leave than fight in this war.” “I don’t like predicting things,” Peter said. “So this is only a possibility. But when you think of 300,000 troops being recruited who would plainly rather be doing anything else, you can see how this could turn out to be his Vietnam.” What else we’ve been reading Zoe Williams compellingly lays out the case for marriage sabbaticals.

The new UK prime minister, who addressed the UN in New York hours after a virtual speech by the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged world leaders not to “let up” on dealing with Putin despite domestic concerns about soaring energy prices. “For the first time in the history of this assembly we are meeting during a large-scale war of aggression in Europe,” she said. “And authoritarian states are undermining stability and security around the world. Geopolitics is entering a new era – one that requires those who believe in the founding principles of the United Nations to stand up and be counted.” She said of the Russian president’s speech: “This morning we have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.” Truss also used her address to highlight the continuing struggle, with economic security at its heart, between democracies and autocracies. “Unless democratic societies deliver on the economy and security our citizens expect, we will fall behind,” she said. “We need to keep improving and renewing what we do for the new era, demonstrating that democracy delivers.” The British prime minister also vowed to “sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it takes”. Earlier, in a joint statement with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, Truss added that the Russian military mobilisation, with 300,000 reservists to be called up as the Kremlin attempts to regain ground in the face of a counterattack by Ukraine’s forces, was “a statement of weakness”. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will face his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at a meeting of the UN security council on Thursday, where he will set out how Russian forces continue to violate international law, and expose how Moscow plans to fix the results of sham referendums in occupied territories. He is expected to say: “We can and must make clear to President Putin that his attacks on the sovereign will of the Ukrainian people – so clearly expressed as they fight for their homes – must stop. His assaults on the UN charter and international norms that protect us will not be tolerated and he must withdraw from Ukraine to enable a return to regional and global stability.” As foreign secretary, Truss travelled to Moscow to meet Lavrov in February, just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, but relations were icy with Russia’s top diplomat describing the talks as a conversation of “the mute with the deaf”, as she warned Moscow of tough sanctions in the event of an attack on Ukraine. British officials are treating Putin’s threat of using nuclear weapons very seriously, both in terms of defence, but also as another example of Russia flouting international agreements. Yet they are ruling out engaging in a battle of words with the Russian president, who they believe is under growing pressure at home after attempting to mobilise reservists who have been trying to get to airports across Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/04/ukraine-says-it-has-put-russian-warship-out-of-action-in-sea-drone-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-04T15:38:36Z","webTitle":"Ukraine says it has put Russian warship out of action in sea drone attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/ukraine-says-it-has-put-russian-warship-out-of-action-in-sea-drone-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/04/ukraine-says-it-has-put-russian-warship-out-of-action-in-sea-drone-attack","fields":{"bodyText":"A Russian landing ship was struck and disabled in the country’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk by an unmanned Ukrainian boat, known as a sea drone, Kyiv said, as onboard camera footage appeared to confirm the success of the night attack. The 112-metre Olenegorsky Gornyak from Russia’s Northern Fleet, which has been used to transport troops and military hardware into occupied Ukrainian ports, was said to have been sufficiently damaged to have been put out of combat action. Images of a Russian warship tilting to its side emerged shortly after the strike and footage was published by the Unian news agency from the head of the marine drone appearing to show it moving stealthily across the Black Sea towards the ship and hitting it at its centre. The agency said the drone was carrying 450kg of explosives. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry had claimed it had destroyed two unmanned sea boats targeting the Russian naval base overnight. A Ukrainian security source told Reuters this assertion was false. “As a result of the attack, the Olenegorsky Gornyak received a serious breach and currently cannot conduct its combat missions,” the source said. “All the Russian statements about a ‘repelled attack’ are fake.” Beyond the battlefield developments, diplomatic tension between Poland and Belarus escalated as Warsaw claimed that two Belarusian helicopters had violated its international airspace on 1 August. Ukraine’s SBU security service also accused Russia of preparing to stage a “false flag” attack at the Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus in order to draw Belarus into the war in Ukraine. Western and Ukrainian diplomats received a boost, however, following the announcement China would be represented in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia for a meeting of national security advisers seeking to agree on the main principles for a future peace settlement. Russia is not attending. “China is willing to work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine,” Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson at the Chinese ministry, said in a statement. China had been invited to a previous round of talks in Copenhagen in late June but did not attend. The Russian port of Novorossiysk exports grain and hosts the terminus of a pipeline that carries most Kazakh oil exports through Russia – handling 2% of the world’s oil supply. The fuel hub’s operator, Caspian Pipeline Consortium, initially suspended operations on Friday morning but later lifted a ban on ship movements to allow oil tankers to be moored at the terminal. The main significance of Thursday night’s attacks was the new evidence of Ukraine’s ability and willingness to strike in the Black Sea. Ukraine has carried out at least 10 attacks with drone boats, targeting military ships, the base in Sevastopol and Novorossiysk harbour. The Olenegorsky Gornyak is a Ropucha-class project 775 large landing ship, built by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, with a capacity to carry a 450-ton cargo and 25 armoured personnel carriers. It has a crew of about 100 and is one of three landing ships that have been permanently on the Black Sea since Russia started its full-scale war against Ukraine in February 2022. A large Russian naval vessel could be seen being towed ashore on Friday, unable to move under its own power. “We have open information that it is indeed damaged,” said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command adding that it was “absolutely legal to destroy the potential of the enemy in time of war.” The Tass Russian state news agency said Russian air defences had downed 10 Ukrainian drones over Crimea on Friday morning and suppressed three more with electronic countermeasures. Photographs were issued by the Kremlin of the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and Sergei Rudskoy, the head of the main operational directorate of the armed forces general staff, visiting frontline headquarters at an unspecified location said to be in occupied Ukraine. Russian state media reported that Shoigu had received an update on the situation on the front and “thanked commanders and soldiers … for successful offensive operations” in Lyman in eastern Ukraine. At the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the UN nuclear watchdog said it had “finally” been granted access requested a month ago and that it had found no explosives after claims of mines being planted around the infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T10:54:54Z","webTitle":"Labour confirms plans to block all new North Sea oil and gas projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour has confirmed it will block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said details would be announced soon. “What we’ll be doing in the coming weeks is outlining how we want to invest in the green jobs of the future, to bring bills down, to create a more sustainable energy supply,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. “We’ll be outlining that in a significant mission in the coming weeks, and we’ll be announcing more details then. “We know we’ve got to move to more renewable sources of energy. It’s important for our climate change commitments, but it’s also the way in which we can bring energy bills down for consumers. This isn’t about shutting down what’s going on now. We will manage those sustainably.” The proposals, which the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland next month, will involve not just a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences, but a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. A party source said: “We are against the granting of new licences for oil and gas in the North Sea. They will do nothing to cut bills as the Tories have acknowledged; they undermine our energy security and would drive a coach and horse through our climate targets. “But Labour would continue to use existing oil and gas wells over the coming decades and manage them sustainably as we transform the UK into a clean energy superpower.” This will not stop drilling on projects that have already been approved, with the exception of the Rosebank and Cambo schemes, which Labour has said previously it would block. Asked if this would leave the country overreliant on wind power, Ashworth said: “It’s a mischaracterisation to say our policies all depend on wind. Yes, we need to invest in wind. We need to invest in tidal; we need to invest in nuclear. “We need more sustainable sources of energy supply in order to bring the bills down for consumers and actually create jobs in this green transition.” The aim, he said, should be for the UK to become a world leader in the green energy transition, and would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said Labour’s plans amounted to an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” that would risk jobs and help Russia in using energy supplies as a weapon. The proposal is the latest in a series of Labour pledges over a move towards a greener economy, much of it pushed by Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary. In 2021, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the party would invest £28bn a year in climate crisis-related measures, covering not just green energy but also areas such as home insulation, active travel and flood defences. At last year’s Labour conference, Starmer said Labour would set up a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, to be known as Great British Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:08:17Z","webTitle":"‘Crazy things are happening’: life in occupied Ukrainian nuclear city ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","fields":{"bodyText":"I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But there are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. The station and the city are almost a single whole, because these are places where people work and live. The station continues its struggle for existence. It is full of Russian military vehicles and soldiers. Only two power units are in operation, not at full capacity. Salaries are being paid. Many employees work remotely. In the nuclear industry, we investigate any deviation in the operation of equipment or a mistake of personnel. Corrective actions have to be taken after that. Now such crazy things are happening at the station, such as the delivery of military equipment to the turbine halls of power units, damage to equipment as a result of shelling the station’s territory, and even, according to some information, the mining of the building. There were reports of people being kidnapped, including station workers. It’s hard to describe the feeling when you read about the kidnapping of a person you know personally. The situation changed dramatically 10 days ago, when the Russians began firing at the station and the outskirts of the city. They hit a high-voltage line, buildings on the station territory, and the spent nuclear fuel storage. The city was left without electricity for several hours. Since then, every day and every night we hear the roar of artillery salvos. Sometimes the Russians drive their artillery so close that it sounds like shooting in a neighbouring yard. Window glasses tremble. It feels like the whole house is shaking. Even those who do not believe in God pray for their salvation. Sometimes it happens in the middle of night. An ordinary person cannot distinguish the sounds of an artillery salvo and a shell burst. Therefore, every time it seems that this is an explosion and the next projectile will hit your house. We know that they are hitting the opposite bank of the Dnieper – the cities of Nikopol and Marganets. A few seconds after the first salvo, an alert is activated in Telegram channels – get to a shelter! Someone is trying to save people day and night. In the morning we read how many houses were destroyed and how many people were killed and injured. For many years these cities perceived our nuclear plant as a source of mortal danger. Now real death is flying from us to them. We can only commiserate with them. Enerhodar is a young city. We love and are proud of it. Now it seems to be seriously ill. Kindergartens and schools were closed immediately after the invasion. Although boys play basketball every day on the playground in front of the school, children’s voices on the street are heard less and less. This is a city of disappearing children. The occupying authorities, which I, fortunately, do not encounter, force people to write prices in hryvnias and rubles. I do not understand where the rubles come from here, except for those that were distributed to some pensioners. Maybe it’s an important part of their reports to Moscow. There is cold and hot water and electricity in the city. In this regard, we have always been under protection of the nuclear plant. Instead of three mobile operators, a Russian “no name” one appeared, using local equipment. Several internet providers have been restored but the traffic passes through Russia, with all Russian internet bans and limitations. Doctors at the hospital are receiving salaries but, as far as I know, there are huge problems with medicines. It is better not to get sick at this time. Here we also have the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant, the largest in Ukraine. It was shut down due to damage to the railway bridge and the impossibility of delivering coal. All billboards in the city are used for Russian propaganda – covered in quotes from Putin and phrases about one people – Russian and Ukrainian. Before that, portraits of Soviet generals from the second world war and heroes of the Soviet Union hung there. People pass by indifferently. Russian flags hang over the city hall and elsewhere, although faded ones. People are leaving the city. I often notice that someone from my apartment block has not been seen for a long time. In any case, everyone is trying to send children and wives to the unoccupied territory or abroad. Two days ago, my neighbour could not stand it and evacuated his children. You can struggle against your own fear but it is impossible to fight fear in the eyes of your children. It is possible to exit the city, but just a week ago, at the checkpoint in Vasilievka, where the line of demarcation runs, there was a queue of thousands of cars from various occupied regions and people stood there for several days. Men stay. Most of them perceive work at the nuclear plant as their duty. Nuclear power workers in Ukraine are legally exempt from conscription, so it’s like their military service. But all the same, staff members are leaving, including operational ones. Despite everything, we continue to believe that all this will end soon. As long as we believe, the station continues to work, and the city continues to live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Lord Deben backs Labour’s plan to halt new North Sea oil and gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK’s most senior climate adviser has strongly endorsed Labour’s vow to halt new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and slammed the government for failing to show leadership on the issue. John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chairs the statutory committee on climate change, told the Guardian he approved of Labour’s commitment. “I welcome this policy, I am absolutely in favour and it is the right thing to do,” he said. “I’m sorry this is not a common view to all parties,” he added. Gummer, a former Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s, blasted ministers who have attacked Labour’s proposals. He pointed out that the government’s support for new oil and gas exploration ran counter to its stance at international climate negotiations, now taking place in Bonn. “I don’t understand how the government can ask other people not to produce more oil [while supporting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea]. That’s exactly what they are doing now – asking other people not to do what they’re doing,” he said. Labour has come under fire over its stance on the North Sea, from the government as well as its own supporters. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, used social media to lambast Keir Starmer, charging him with committing to higher energy bills. The GMB union also attacked Starmer after he last week reaffirmed a commitment made earlier this year to halt the drilling of new oil and gas wells in the North Sea. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB Union, claimed it was “naive” and would cost jobs. But Starmer has strongly defended his decision, which along with commitments to green jobs, new nuclear power and renewable energy will form the centrepiece of a policy statement to be made in Scotland later this month. Gummer told the Guardian that leaders across the political spectrum should follow Labour’s lead. “This should be the common view of all parties,” he said. He said it was “nonsense” to claim that new oil and gas fields would reduce energy bills. “These are new oilfields that will not come on stream for another 10 or 20 years. And when they do, the oil and gas will be sold to the highest bidder. So it will not reduce prices in the UK. The only way you could make them reduce bills here would be to nationalise them.” He said fears over jobs at risk in the North Sea were also unfounded. He said the UK should continue to produce gas from existing fields in the short term, but future jobs would be in green industries. “I’m in favour of producing more gas now, we need it owing to what Putin has done, but we are not talking about that – we are talking about new oilfields that would not come on stream for many years,” he said. “There are vast numbers of jobs to be had in offshore and onshore wind, in solar PV, which are all much cheaper than using oil. The jobs are all there in green industries – these are new jobs, the oil jobs are old jobs. Trade unions should be supporting new job creation.” Gummer said he also favoured building new nuclear power stations, which Starmer has also pledged to support. Before his ennoblement as Lord Deben, Gummer was a long-serving Conservative MP and former environment secretary and minister, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He is due to leave his CCC post later this month, and a successor has not yet been named. International negotiations are taking place in Bonn this week and next over how to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. But the government would not confirm to the Guardian whether any ministers will attend. Gummer said a halt to new oil and gas exploration was essential to keep the global climate livable. “Climate change will mean we will not be able to live as we do now, in the very near future. It’s urgent, it has to be dealt with, and we cannot ignore it,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “In line with our net zero 2050 commitment, we will not shy away from awarding new licences where they are justified, and where they can benefit Britain. While our plans to power up Britain include significant investment in new renewable and nuclear projects, the transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we’re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent CCC.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-527-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-04T19:18:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 527 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-527-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/04/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-527-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s security service and navy claimed to have used an unmanned boat, known as a sea drone, to scupper a landing ship in Russia’s Black sea port of Novorossiysk, as on-board camera footage emerged of an apparent twilight attack. The 112 metre long Olenegorsky Gornyak from Russia’s Northern Fleet, which has been used to transport troops and military hardware into occupied Ukrainian ports, was said by officials in Kyiv to be sufficiently damaged to have been put out of combat action. The claim came as images emerged of both a Russian war ship tilting to its side and then footage from the head of the marine drone of it apparently moving stealthy across the Black Sea towards the ship and then striking it at its centre. The images could not be immediately independently verified. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry had claimed that they had successfully destroyed two unmanned sea boats targeting the Russian naval base overnight. The Black Sea port of Novorossiysk hosts the terminus of a pipeline that carries most Kazakh oil exports through Russia. The Security Service of Ukraine accused Russia on Friday of preparing to stage a “false flag” attack at the Mozyr oil refinery in Belarus in order to blame Ukrainian saboteurs as part of an effort to draw Minsk into the war in Ukraine. Ukraine and its allies aim to rally global support for a peace blueprint in talks hosted by Saudi Arabia this weekend, with western officials increasingly optimistic that China will attend, lending the talks a new weight. The UN nuclear watchdog has “finally” been granted access to areas of the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine that it first requested a month ago and has found no explosives, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was sentenced on Friday to an additional 19 years in prison after being found guilty on a series of new charges, according to his supporters. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, has condemned the court’s decision on Friday to add an extra 19 years to the jail term of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. President Vladimir Putin has signed a law introducing a windfall tax on excess profits of Russian companies, which was published on a government website on Friday. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has visited a combat zone in Ukraine to inspect a command post and meet senior military officers, the army said Friday. Shoigu got an update on the situation on the front and “thanked commanders and soldiers... for successful offensive operations” in Lyman in eastern Ukraine, it said, without mentioning when the visit took place. The minister, the subject of intense criticism from Yevgeny Prigozhin leading up to the aborted Wagner rebellion, was also shown getting on a Swedish CV90 - “one of the many armoured vehicles taken during fighting”, the army statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T05:00:51Z","webTitle":"As Russia’s armed forces fight among themselves, it’s hard to know who’s in control | Samantha de Bendern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin","fields":{"bodyText":"Coming just a day before the world’s media became submerged in the tragic aftermath of the explosion of the Kakhovka dam in Russian-controlled Ukraine, Yevgeny Prigozhin’s latest invective against the Russian army on 5 June slipped under the radar. It was his most explosive yet. Dressed in a khaki sweatshirt and trousers, in the middle of a forest in a Wagner training camp, Prigozhin, the commander of an army of contract fighters known as the Wagner group, accuses the Russian army of lying about events in the Belgorod region – where anti-Putin Russian partisans have been conducting cross-border raids from Ukraine since late May – and warns of the risk of civil war. He calls for the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu to be put on trial for facilitating “the genocide of the Russian population” by being totally unprepared for the war in Ukraine, and more than once suggests that Shoigu and other senior military command should be shot. Prigozhin also claims that inhabitants of the Belgorod region have been writing to him, suggesting a Chile-type solution. “Chile means Pinochet,” explains Prigozhin. “… The Russian elite in a stadium surrounded by armed men with machine guns.” Prigozhin even plays the nuclear card, initially saying that it would be counterproductive to use it now and that “the button should have been pressed earlier … even though it would have been the act of a fucked-up psychopath”. Later in the interview he suggests that Russians would be capable of using a nuclear weapon on their own territory. This comes with the comforting caveat that he’s unsure how well nuclear weapons would work if they are as badly maintained as the rest of Russia’s weaponry. Thе hour-long interview follows Prigozhin’s tour of Russian cities during which he spoke of the need to open a “second front”, in the information sphere, to tell the population the truth about what is happening on the front lines and recommended the creation of a territorial army specifically to protect Russia. Even though he denies having any political ambitions, all these elements together look very much like a politician preparing either for an electoral campaign or an armed coup. The question remains whether Prigozhin is controlled by the Kremlin, or is a loose cannon posing a serious threat to the regime. Since in Russia nothing is ever as it seems, this either/or question is probably far too simple. Some things however seem clearer than others. Prigozhin would not be able to travel around Russia holding court without support and protection at the highest level. Moreover, as he vilifies what he calls the corrupt elites and calls with impunity for them to be executed, Russia’s most famous anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny, is rotting away in a penal colony and faces a potential 30-year prison sentence. Those with protection in the right places can say what they want. After taking Bakhmut, Prigozhin decided to withdraw his forces, leaving the regular Russian army to hold the city. Was he allowed to do this in the knowledge that Russia’s grip on Bakhmut was threatened by the Ukrainian armed forces who have regained control of parts of the surrounding countryside? If in the coming weeks the Russians lose the city, the regular army will be blamed, and Prigozhin’s Bakhmut victory will be intact. Again, this points to patronage at the highest level allowing him to save face. By suggesting the creation of a territorial defence and opening what he calls his second Wagner front domestically, Prigozhin appears to be positioning himself to play a mix of policing, security and information/propaganda roles inside Russia. This is vastly different from being a proxy foreign policy tool and private army operating abroad, particularly considering that Wagner, like most other private military companies (apart from those created to protect critical infrastructure), is still officially illegal. Without high-up support it seems hard to imagine how long this ambition will go unchallenged. Another thing that is becoming clearer is intra-Russian chaos and animosity, if not outright armed conflict. In the last week, Wagner forces detained an officer of the Russian federal army whom they accused of mining their retreat and shooting at them while drunk; anti-Putin Russian partisans captured Russian regular forces and invited the governor of the Belgorod region to negotiate their freedom; and a high-ranking Chechen fighter openly criticised Yevgeny Prigozhin, highlighting the rivalry between the Chechen forces and Wagner. Without counting the mounting jealousies between the growing number of Russian private armies, the above describes at least four factions of armed Russians (including one fighting on the Ukrainian side) in conflict with each other. If one accepts that Prigozhin is protected by the Kremlin, to what extent does the Kremlin actually mean Putin? So far Prigozhin has refrained from direct attacks on the president and has even said that he respects him. However, by mocking Russia’s nuclear decision-making and capabilities in his recent harangue, he appears to be undermining the very concept of Russia’s nuclear deterrent. It is hard not to see this as a criticism of Putin who is the ultimate arbiter of nuclear use. Double, triple bluff? Prigozhin’s latest rant looks more and more like the tip of an iceberg that betrays growing fractures inside Russia’s top power structure. In a country that cannot even defend a small sliver of its border from incursions and allows drones to hit the centre of power, it is difficult to imagine a master in the Kremlin who has the absolute control, foresight and planning capacity necessary to manage all this chaos and pull Prigozhin’s puppet strings. In February 2022, two days before the invasion of Ukraine, senior members of Russia’s security council cowered in submission before a seemingly omnipotent Putin. As the war grinds on, these same men may be the ones planning to take control from a president who seems increasingly divorced from the realities of the front line. They will need a scapegoat for the disastrous “special military operation”. With his frequent diatribes against the regular army, Prigozhin is handing them the heads of the Russian armed forces on a plate. Perhaps he is also promising to be their front man and guarantor of immunity as he helps navigate the chaos to come. Whether or not this includes Putin is anyone’s guess.

Ministers will decide in July whether to approve the development of the Suffolk power station proposed by the French developer EDF. The business department has estimated that the government-backed scheme will add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich Business School seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. At its costliest point, the build could cost taxpayers nearly £4 a month. That represents the study’s gloomiest forecast, which predicts construction would take 17 years and cost £43.8bn. The project had been expected to cost £20bn and take 10-12 years to build. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Greenwich Business School, said the average forecast put the cost at £35bn over 15 years, or £2.3bn a year. The figures could further inflame the debate over the cost and time of building power stations after Boris Johnson last month set a target of building a new nuclear station every year. EDF admitted last week that Hinkley Point C, the power station it is developing in Somerset, would cost an extra £3bn, taking it to up to £26bn. The already delayed project will take an extra year, and is expected to begin generating electricity in June 2027. EDF had originally planned for it be operational by Christmas 2017. The French firm said consumers would not be hit by the extra costs at Hinkley Point C, which will be taken on by EDF and China’s CGN, its junior partner in the project. However, at Sizewell C the government has already committed £100m to the project and plans to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk and making an asset more attractive to outside investors. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The government argues that the RAB model could reduce the project cost of a nuclear power station by more than £30bn over its 60-year lifespan. The model was used in the construction of Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Thames Tideway super-sewer. A final decision on plans for Sizewell C was recently pushed back from 25 May to 8 July. The site is located north of EDF’s existing Sizewell B plant. Campaigners argue that the development would be costly and threatens the local environment. The prospect of extra costs comes as consumers face soaring bills amid the energy crisis. The government has been urged to intervene with annual bills forecast to balloon to nearly £3,000 from October. Johnson has thrown his weight behind nuclear power as a green option to boost Britain’s energy security in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as he targets net zero emissions by 2050. Thomas said: “It may not seem a huge amount extra on bills but several of these projects will overlap, meaning consumers paying even more for a long time. If costs are even higher than expected, it could become a real burden.” A spokesperson for Sizewell C said: “The RAB model is a tried and tested financing arrangement, which has already been used to raise funds for more than £160bn of UK infrastructure. Applied to Sizewell C, it will bring the cost of finance down and deliver significant savings to consumers.” A government spokesperson said: “We firmly stand by our assessment that a large-scale project funded under our Nuclear Act would add at most a few pounds a year to typical household energy bills during the early stages of construction, and on average about £1 a month during the full construction phase of the project.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-542-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-19T00:44:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 542 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-542-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-542-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says Moscow’s possession of nuclear weapons protects the country from external security threats, while reminding the west of the risks of a nuclear conflict. “The possession of nuclear arms is today the only possible response to some of significant external threats to security of our country,” Lavrov said in an interview for state-owned magazine The International Affairs. Lavrov warned the US and Nato allies risk ending up in “a situation of direct armed confrontation of nuclear powers”. “We believe such a development should be prevented. That’s why we have to remind about the existence of high military and political risks and send sobering signals to our opponents,” Lavrov said. The number of battlefield casualties in Ukraine is approaching nearly 500,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, US officials have told the New York Times, marking a significant rise in the death toll this year after intense fighting in the east of the country. Russia’s military casualties are approaching 300,000, the officials claimed, with as many as 120,000 killed in action. Ukraine was said to have close to 70,000 killed and 100,000-120,000 wounded. Fierce fighting near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine have led to significant casualties on both sides, more than doubling the number of dead since November. Ukrainian forces could fail to retake the Russian-occupied strategic south-eastern city of Melitopol during their counteroffensive, a US official said. Melitopol has been under Russian control since March 2022 and has roads and railways used by its troops to transport supplies to areas they occupy. The US official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was citing an intelligence report, but the prediction is largely in line with Washington’s view that Ukraine’s counteroffensive is progressing slower than expected. The official added that despite the report and limited progress towards Melitopol, the US believed it was still possible to change the gloomy outlook. One person was killed and two injured as a result of Russian shelling of a village near the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the prosecutor general’s office said. Some private houses were damaged in the attack, but no further details were provided. In a separate case, four people were injured after Russia shelled a residential area of the city of Chasiv Yar, located in the Donetsk region close to Bakhmut. Russia is continuing its crackdown against critics at home and abroad, with authorities shut down prominent rights group the Sakharov Centre, saying it had illegally hosted conferences and exhibitions. Critics say the group is the latest target of the Kremlin’s battle against liberal-leaning organisations that challenge the state. Separately, a Russian court has placed the co-chair of independent election monitoring group Golos in pre-trial detention until at least 17 October. The ruling comes as Russia gears up for regional elections next month. Moscow also announced sanctions against international criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan, who in March issued a warrant against Putin accusing him of having “illegally deported” thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Kyiv has welcomed a US decision to let Denmark and the Netherlands hand F-16 fighter jets over to Ukraine once its pilots are trained to use them. A US official confirmed Denmark and the Netherlands had been given “formal assurances” for the jet transfer. Training by an 11-nation coalition is to begin this month, and officials hope pilots will be ready by early 2024. Ukrainian defence minister Oleksii Reznikov hailed “great news from our friends in the United States”. Russian forces have destroyed Ukrainian drones targeting Moscow and its Black Sea fleet. Russia’s defence ministry said its air force had downed a Ukrainian drone over the capital early Friday morning. Footage showed damage to an expo centre on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment of the Moskva River, 100 metres from Moscow city. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal hailed “important and constructive” talks on grain exports with his Romanian counterpart Marcel Ciolacu during a visit to Bucharest. Ciolacu said Romania wanted to double the amount of Ukrainian grain transiting his country to 4m tonnes. The talks came a day after the first civilian cargo ship sailed through the Black Sea from Ukraine to Istanbul in defiance of a Russian blockade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T01:42:39Z","webTitle":"NSW coal power stations set to receive $500m in price-cap compensation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/04/nsw-coal-power-stations-set-to-receive-500m-in-price-cap-compensation","fields":{"bodyText":"Coal power stations in New South Wales are set to receive $500m in price-cap compensation, according to state government sources, further fuelling fears payouts are nearing $1bn. The compensation figure for NSW’s power producers comes on top of an estimate of up to $450m for Queensland’s Gladstone plant, a figure the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, disputed in December before the state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, appeared to contradict him. In December the Albanese government legislated a temporary price cap of $12 a gigajoule for gas and $125 a tonne for coal, as part of a package including $1.5bn in electricity price relief to save households about $230 on their power bills. To encourage continued supply, where coal power producers have actual costs exceeding the $125 price cap – such as pre-existing supply contracts for more expensive coal – the federal and state governments agreed to provide them a rebate. On Wednesday the Australian reported, and Guardian Australia has confirmed, that according to NSW government sources the figure for that state’s coal power producers will be about $500m. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Recipients would include Australia’s biggest generator, the Origin-owned Eraring power station to Newcastle’s south, along with coal stations at Bayswater, Liddell, Mount Piper and Vales Point B. A spokesperson for the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said “details of the financial assistance are currently being finalised with the NSW government”. The spokesperson said rebates were only offered where pre-existing contracts for coal are above $125 a tonne or in the “very rare circumstances in which reasonable cost of production exceeds $125 a tonne”. “These actions are necessary to shield Australian households and businesses from the worst of the energy price spikes and ensure power prices are as low as possible.” Last month a Queensland government source told Guardian Australia the $450m payout figure for Rio Tinto and its Gladstone power station partners would be “in the ballpark”, although state generators returning in May should limit compensation to six months. The $450m price tag prompted a backlash from the Greens, with their leader, Adam Bandt, saying “not a single dollar of public money” should go to coal and gas corporations, and from the independent senator David Pocock, who said it “raises serious concerns about the total amount of compensation to be paid”. “The briefings and information I received suggested that any compensation under this plan to bring much-needed energy price relief for households and small businesses would be minimal and confined to a small number of generators,” Pocock said. Asked about the reported Gladstone payout, Albanese said: “No, those reports are just that, they are reports … We expect that [for Gladstone] it will be nothing like the sort of figures that I’ve seen in the newspaper.” But Palaszczuk appeared to confirm the figure was possible as a maximum, responding “yes, we did know” compensation for Gladstone could be “up to $450m”. “All of that was worked out when we reached the agreement we reached,” she told reporters. Federal government sources last month said they still expected the total price of compensation to be between $500m and $1bn, figures Guardian Australia reported in mid-December based on a Treasury briefing that included estimates of $250m for NSW producers. The rate of compensation is being determined by a reconciliation of electricity producers’ actual costs with the $125 cap, made more difficult by the fact costs can vary with a combination of coal at a pre-contracted price or from the spot market."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-15T12:00:13Z","webTitle":"Power behind the baton: the conductor who prepared Cate Blanchett for Tár ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/15/natalie-murray-beale-conductor-prepared-cate-blanchett-for-tar","fields":{"bodyText":"Cate Blanchett’s new film role as an imposing orchestral conductor is earning her a shot at another top acting award. But it has already given the Oscar-winner the skills to lead a real orchestra through a score. The actor, who plays fictional American conductor Lydia Tár in the film, Tár, mastered the complexities of the job by training with Natalie Murray Beale, an established star in the field who lives in London and who spent weeks coaching Blanchett for the part. Murray Beale, the hidden force behind the powerful performance, supervised the orchestral scenes after guiding Blanchett during rehearsals. “Cate can conduct now, if she wants,” Murray Beale told the Observer. “She is very musical, sings beautifully and now she has the tools to conduct. I suggested she learn the musical lines of the pieces by heart, rather than learning the score or copying another performance.” Murray Beale, 46, conducts opera, concerts and film scores and, like Blanchett, is Australian. “We developed her own style, but she’s an actress who changes all the time and we didn’t want it to be fixed, since at that level of conducting there is no strict, standard way to do it. A top orchestra is virtuosic, so you don’t need to do all the basics; you can express yourself more. We looked a lot at the physical aspects, ensuring she would not be too reverent of the conductor’s podium, because after all it’s just her workplace.” Some early audiences have protested about director Todd Field’s portrayal of a manipulative and selfish woman in a rare position of authority, but the musicianship and the examination of toxic power have convinced many who work in classical music. “I’m delighted that colleagues say it is authentic,” said Murray Beale. “We went into great detail on the psychology of conducting. These abusive behaviours do still exist. There are not many places where a boss has such power. A conductor is a gatekeeper. I have witnessed anger in rehearsal and even a tussle between conductor and musician. It’s a highly competitive field.” As a young conservatoire student in Australia, Murray Beale herself was affected. “I experienced inappropriate behaviour from a teacher, which I reported. And yet the person concerned was protected. It’s very difficult for institutions because they don’t want things to reflect badly on them.” The conductor believes “the old boys’ club” has been broken down “to some extent”. “There is much more diversity now and the musicians have much more voice. That is a significant, positive change.” Field’s decision to cast a woman in the role of an abusive “maestro”, she argues, allows audiences to see the problem “with fresh eyes”. Whatever cinemagoers decide about the treatment of the subject, Murray Beale adds, there is an overriding value to showing a woman as a highly skilled, admired musician. “It’s very easy for people to have a strong personal reaction to this film, but for me the lack of visibility for female conductors is the real problem. So it was exciting to realise this film will be seen all over the world, particularly in places where women are never shown in such authoritative roles.” One of the hardest elements of conducting is the task of absorbing all the musical material, but for Blanchett, Murray Beale suspects, the most difficult moment was her first encounter with the full orchestra in Dresden, Germany, where the film was largely shot. “Because of the lockdowns we hadn’t had much practice with that. Luckily, we were able to have some rehearsals. I said to Cate, ‘Just don’t be apologetic,’ and she developed a fantastic rapport. Whenever the musicians were drained and fatigued, she was able to flip the atmosphere by making them laugh.” And Murray Beale soon detected a helpful, unexpected parallel between the plot of the film and the musical work of a conductor. “You need to create a lot of tension as a conductor, building up the sense in a concert piece that at some point it all has to break. I think this screenplay, and particularly the way the film has been edited, are just like that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T13:40:56Z","webTitle":"Power struggles: UK companies gear up for winter blackouts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/04/power-struggles-companies-winter-blackouts-uk-generators","fields":{"bodyText":"In nearly 40 years as a shopkeeper, James Daunt has had to deal with power cuts many times. “Sometimes there’s a flood or a huge JCB digger has gone through your power supply,” says the founder of Daunt Books, and managing director of Waterstones. “You might run the power from the guy next door, or sometimes you’re literally going round with a torch collecting books for customers in the gloom.” But this winter could present a very different challenge. If gas supplies run too low, the government has crisis plans for a series of rolling three-hour power cuts, with regions of the UK taking it in turn to go dark. This week, the Guardian revealed that officials have also dusted down Programme Yarrow, which would kick in if there were a complete nationwide blackout. It involves prioritising food, water and shelter for the young and for older people, and examines how to communicate with the public. Only hospitals, oil refineries and certain other critical services would be protected. One of the last big power cuts, in August 2019, hit a million customers’ electricity supplies, and caused chaos for rail, road and air commuters. Shop tills froze, IT systems crashed and factories shut down. Thousands of bosses across the country are working out how to prepare their businesses for the worst-case scenarios. In retail, ensuring that stores can still trade is prioritised. Waterstones’ till systems are backed up with uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, which can work offline. “When the power comes back, all the money flows through,” says Daunt. “The UPS units cannot provide enough power for adequate lighting but you carry on in the gloom – customers are very tolerant of it.” At other shops without these backups, transactions become near impossible in an increasingly cashless economy. As the threatened three-hour blackouts are designed to be evenly spread across the country, Daunt believes that it could be “swings and roundabouts” for his 300 stores nationwide, depending on where and when the cuts fall. For supermarkets – with huge supply chains, chillers and lighting requirements – energy is a huge resource. Sainsbury’s this week said it can control ventilation and lighting in stores and can be “very agile” in responding to issues, although it is not stocking up on generators for each store. Waitrose says the “vast majority of our main buildings have secondary power supplies”. Iceland’s boss, Richard Walker, says the retailer is “in the process of mapping out our future energy requirements” and is installing solar panels at its shops and warehouses. He concedes, however, that nationwide blackouts would make it difficult to keep shops open. In the City, where lost trading time could cost millions of pounds, catastrophe protocols are being studied. Banks in London may use locations beyond the Square Mile, mainly in Essex and Surrey, which were called upon in the pandemic. JPMorgan has said it has contingency plans for all its locations, and can even move staff between offices in different countries. The trade body UK Finance says firms are “making sure their ducks are in a row” and studying precedents in markets such as South Africa, where power cuts are commonplace. Typically, City firms have at least 72 hours of backup generator power, as well as on-site engineers. Industries where being efficient with time is crucial are particularly exposed to power cuts. A senior newspaper executive says it has a “Mary Celeste-style” empty office far from its central London newsroom to ensure it can continue to publish in an emergency on tight deadlines. The site has capacity for about 30 core editors and production staff. “The office is meant to be used in the case of some form of disaster. It has a backup generator, which is tested regularly,” he says. “Improvements in technology allowing people to work from home have made it slightly less important – the key is to have remote access to your core system and protect your server.” Home working will be reliant on robust telecoms, but this is an industry used to outages, typically caused by problems such as storms, and falling trees hitting overhead lines. BT operates 6,000 UK exchanges, each of which has a backup generator. Simon Lowth, BT’s chief financial officer, said this week it has held talks with the government about potentially using the generators for wider public use “to help cope with demand at peaks”. Its ubiquitous green cabinets, seen on Britain’s street corners, which provide broadband connections, have four hours of backup power. The British Gas owner Centrica advises businesses that, rather than protect an entire site from electricity loss at huge cost, they should prioritise essential systems. Certain industries simply cannot function in darkness: blackouts in the West End in 2016 forced performances to be scrapped at some of the country’s best known venues. Some consumers have begun contingency planning. Demand for airfryers, electric blankets and energy monitors had already soared as shoppers sought to cut bills. Now, Google Trends data shows a sharp increase in searches for portable power packs and torches. The slightly apocalyptic scenario has also piqued the interest of survivalists, or “preppers”, who proactively prepare for emergencies. A Reddit discussion among preppers on the prospect of UK blackouts shows users encouraging each other to buy bio-ethanol fires, USB-powered electric blankets, dry pre-packaged meals, water filters and plumbing supplies in case pipes freeze. One senior energy executive says: “The more remote your house is, or the more essential a service your business provides, the more robust your plans for power loss should be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:01:37Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 453 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-453-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory in Belgorod has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the electricity grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators were used. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit at the weekend. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:26:41Z","webTitle":"Shelling temporarily disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, has said.

It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st Independence Day, celebrated on Wednesday, which was also the six-month mark since Russia invaded. “I know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,” Biden tweeted after the phone call. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. The plant was disconnected twice from the Ukrainian grid on Thursday after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out during the war. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” Energoatom said on Thursday. The severing of that connection briefly caused a blackout in the Zaporizhzhia region, said Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor for the area. Power has now been restored. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday that the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident. “If the diesel generators had not turned on … if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” He called on the IAEA and other world bodies to act much faster to force Russian troops to leave the territory of the station. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. The latest crisis at the plant, which has previously been threatened by fires, came as the death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a railway station and village in south-central Dnipropetrovsk region rose to 25. The three rocket strikes also injured 31, according to Ukraine’s authorities. The area was hit on Independence Day – an anniversary overshadowed by US warnings that Russia may be planning to “step up” attacks. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had successfully hit a military train, killing 200 Ukrainian soldiers. It said the train was set to deliver arms to the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. It is impossible to corroborate the claims. Ukraine’s authorities do not regularly share information about their military losses. At least some of the victims appear to have been civilians. Pictures and footage of the aftermath aired by Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne showed at least one destroyed house in the village and extensive damage elsewhere. Those interviewed by Suspilne said fellow villagers had died. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office, said two children, aged six and 11, were killed, the latter when their house was destroyed. Zelenskiy said five people were killed while sitting in a car. Tetyana Kvitnytska, the deputy director of health at the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said four children were among the injured, three of whom were in a serious condition. She said there were shrapnel wounds, burns and fractures. Only two pictures have been released so far of the railway carriages that were hit, which appear burnt out and flattened in places. Tymoshenko said five passenger carriages caught fire and a utility building at the railway station had been hit. The EU’s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter: “The EU strongly condemns another terrible Russian attack on the civilian population in Chaplyny on Ukraine’s independence day. Those responsible for Russian missile terror will be held accountable.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:45Z","webTitle":"Landlords to be given more powers to evict tenants for antisocial behaviour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/may/12/landlords-to-be-given-more-powers-to-evict-tenants-for-antisocial-behaviour","fields":{"bodyText":"Landlords in England will be able to evict tenants for antisocial behaviour more easily as part of a wider package of reforms to the rental market, after heavy lobbying by industry organisations and Conservative backbenchers. Michael Gove will use the renters’ reform bill, which could be introduced to the Commons as soon as next week, to strengthen landlords’ rights when it comes to dealing with alleged antisocial behaviour. The move is designed both to reduce antisocial behaviour and to allay landlords’ concerns as the housing secretary also prepares to bring an end to “no-fault” evictions. But charities warn it could also harm victims of domestic abuse, who are often accused mistakenly by neighbours of antisocial behaviour because of the violence happening within their homes. Deidre Cartwright, the senior housing manager at Standing Together Against Domestic Abuse, said: “We welcome the fact that no-fault eviction is ending. But the worry is that by expanding the grounds for landlords to evict people for antisocial behaviour, the government is creating a back door for landlords who otherwise would have used the no-fault route.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “We will bring forward legislation very shortly, which will include a ban on no-fault evictions, so that all tenants have greater security in their homes and are empowered to challenge poor conditions.” The centrepiece of the bill will be a ban on property owners evicting tenants without showing any fault on the tenants’ part, something some landlords do as a way to put up rents before a contract ends. The ban fulfils a manifesto commitment the Conservatives made in 2019 and is part of a push by Gove to refocus Tory housing policy on renters and leaseholders in part to win back young urban voters who have deserted the party in their millions. He is already having to water down parts of that move, however. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday he had been forced to drop plans to end leaseholds altogether after Downing Street warned it could not be accomplished before the election. In recent weeks, Gove has also come under heavy pressure to change the rental proposals as well, with Tory MPs and landlord organisations calling for the bill to give landlords more rights. In recent weeks ministers have met MPs on the Property Research Group, a group of Tory MPs formed to fight against property tax, but which also contains several landlords. The group was set up by Kevin Hollinrake, a business minister who co-founded Hunters estate agents and owns five properties from which he collects rent. They have also been lobbied by the National Residential Landlords Association, which has campaigned for greater landlord rights in a number of areas, including antisocial behaviour. Ben Beadle, the chief executive of the NRLA, said: “We want to see an announcement that gives responsible landlords the confidence that they can evict tenants for things such as rent arrears or antisocial behaviour.” Government sources say Gove has agreed that it should be easier for landlords to evict tenants on antisocial behaviour grounds, though they deny this is as a result of the lobbying he has come under. One said: “The idea this is a sop to landlords is absurd.” Many of the proposals that will be included in the bill when it is introduced to the Commons featured in Rishi Sunak’s antisocial behaviour action plan, which the prime minister published earlier this year. They include expanding the definition of antisocial behaviour to include “any behaviour capable of causing nuisance or annoyance”, and making it easier for landlords to prove such behaviour in court. Some are concerned, however, that the measures could tilt the balance of power too far towards landlords. Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said: “We will need to see the detail of these proposals, but we do not want to see landlords being able to claim that tenants are being antisocial simply because they make complaints about them or their properties.” The concerns around domestic abuse, meanwhile, stem from the fact that domestic abuse victims are four times more likely to have antisocial behaviour complaints made against them, often because neighbours simply misunderstand what is happening inside a household."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-05T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"Billionaire investor Křetínský and trader Vitol eye fortune in British power plant subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","fields":{"bodyText":"The billionaire West Ham United investor Daniel Křetínský and Swiss commodities giant Vitol are among bidders hoping to land hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies to keep the lights on in Great Britain. National Grid’s electricity system operator is preparing to announce successful bidders in a “capacity market” auction this month for 2026. The annual auction will set a subsidy price to pay owners of power stations and battery storage facilities to cover the cost of being on standby in case of any rapid need for extra electricity. The costs are covered through consumer bills. Existing plants are awarded one-year deals, with new-builds given 15-year contracts to guarantee covering investment costs. Analysis of the public register before the auction shows that 69 new-build gas-fired plants have been proposed for 15-year contracts. Gas accounted for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power. The prospect of more fossil-fuel-powered plants may anger green campaigners and those urging the government to move faster in supporting renewables projects. The auction comes as the energy regulator Ofgem draws up proposals to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Energy industry profits are under intense scrutiny amid high consumer bills. Shell caused outrage after unveiling record profits last week, while BP is expected to post fourth-quarter underlying profits of about $5bn on Tuesday. Křetínský, known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, has come to prominence in Britain after taking stakes in Royal Mail, West Ham United FC and the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. The tycoon’s UK energy assets include the Langage and South Humber Bank gas plants and Lynemouth biomass plant in Northumberland. Křetínský’s EP UK Investments is bidding for 15-year contracts to guarantee supply from three new-build gas units at Eggborough. The North Yorkshire project’s backers argue there is an “urgent need” to replace electricity generation lost from retiring coal and nuclear plants in the UK. EP UK also hopes to land one-year contracts at Langage and South Humber Bank. VPI – owned by Vitol, which has posted rising profits during the energy crisis – wants to secure 15-year contracts to let it build two new gas-fired units at Damhead Creek in Kent. VPI is also bidding for one-year contracts for plants at Immingham in north Lincolnshire, Damhead Creek in Kent, Shoreham outside Brighton, and Rye House in Hertfordshire. Rye House drew scrutiny after it submitted the 20 highest winter bids for power on 12 December, setting new records as National Grid paid out £27m to keep the lights on during cold, still conditions. InterGen, which received an estimated £12.6m on 12 December, is also bidding, for one-year contracts for its sites at Spalding, Rocksavage and Coryton. EP UK’s proposed new-build units at Eggborough could be worth more than £840m in subsidy payments over 15 years while VPI’s plans at Damhead Creek could bring in more than £750m, according to Aurora Energy Research. EP UK’s existing units are expected to be worth more than £64m a year, while Vitol’s trio of plants may account for more than £54m, based on last year’s prices – and prices are expected to rise in this month’s auction, in part due to inflation. Other applications include a Drax project in south Wales and a series of projects in the south-east proposed by Statera Energy. Marlon Dey, head of research for UK and Ireland at Aurora, said: “Gas remains essential for security of supply today, and keeping the lights on during a period of low wind and solar power. There is still a long way to go in order to scale up renewable power to reduce our dependency on gas further. “If gas-fired peaking plants are used sparingly, they will have an important role to play and are not necessarily incompatible with net zero – depending how much they are used.” The government hopes to secure 42GW to 45GW of capacity in the auction on 21 February. Existing plant owners plan to submit bids for 39 gigawatts worth of power, meaning new-build plants must provide 3-6GW – enough to power 2.5m to 5m homes. Last year’s auction set a price of £30.59 per kW hour to secure 42GW of power, at a cost of £2.1bn over 15 years. Separately, National Grid said on Sunday it had asked owner Uniper to put a unit at its coal-fired power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire on standby in case it is needed on Tuesday during a period of low wind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Thousands left without power in Victoria as huge storm sweeps state","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/22/thousands-left-without-power-in-victoria-as-huge-storm-sweeps-state","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands of Victorians have been left without power and Melbourne airport has been forced to ground flights as a major storm front swept across the state’s south. There was also extreme weather on the way for parts of the Northern Territory and West Australian coasts on Friday as a tropical low deepened over the Timor Sea. More than 5,500 households and customers were experiencing power outages in Victoria as of 8.30pm on Thursday, many in Melbourne’s western suburbs. The Bureau of Meteorology issued a severe thunderstorm warning for large parts of the state from Echuca in the north to Geelong in the south amid the downpour. The weather event first hit the Geelong, Port Phillip and the Bellarine peninsula regions on Thursday afternoon, moving east to north-east as the night progressed. Melbourne airport was lashed with the heaviest initial downpour, recording 40mm of rain in the 20 minutes to 5.30pm, resulting in the delays of a number of inbound and outbound flights. Hail up to 3cm in diameter was reported in Geelong around the same time, while Tatura recorded 26mm of rain in the 30 minutes to 7pm. A spokesperson for Melbourne airport said all aerodrome operations were temporarily suspended on Thursday due to the risk of lightning, which resulted in the grounded flights. “Now that the storm has passed, ground staff have resumed operations and are working to safely get passengers to their destinations,” they said. “This afternoon’s storm has resulted in a significant number of water leaks across Melbourne airport’s terminals and we are currently cleaning up the impacted areas. “The safety of passengers and staff is our top priority. We apologise to passengers for the inconvenience.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Areas impacted later on Thursday evening included metropolitan Melbourne and the regional cities of Shepparton, Seymour, Ballarat, Geelong, Wangaratta, Traralgon and Bairnsdale. Parts of Craigieburn were already experiencing flooding and building damage as the storm moved through Melbourne, the Victoria Emergency website confirmed. “A low pressure trough is combining with a moist and unstable atmosphere to produce showers and thunderstorms across much of Victoria,” the BoM said. “Heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding, damaging winds and large hailstones are likely.” Victoria’s State Emergency Service (SES) warned Victorians to avoid travel if possible amid dangerous conditions and, if on the road, to look out for hazards including flood water and fallen trees. It said recent storms may make trees unstable and likelier to fall amid windy or wet conditions. A flood warning remained in place for the state’s Murray and Edward rivers, with prolonged flooding continuing at Euston, Mildura, Wentworth, Moulamein, Barham, Wakool Junction and Boundary Bend. The Murray wasn’t expected to fall below a minor flood level in Victoria until early January as water moves into South Australia’s catchments. Conditions have eased in the Mallee district, leading to the cancellation of a severe thunderstorm warning. The BoM said the tropical low across northern Australia may develop into a tropical cyclone on Friday morning before crossing the coast near the Western Australia-NT border. It declared a warning zone from Dundee Beach in the NT to Kalumburu in WA including Wadeye, Kununurra and Wyndham, but not including Kalumburu. Senior meteorologist Rebecca Patrick told the ABC the system would weaken when it passed over land but regardless of its intensity “it will remain as a deep depression and still bring heavy rainfall”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jul/06/new-york-farm-workers-ufw-unions","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Union wins at New York farms raise hopes for once-powerful UFW","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/06/new-york-farm-workers-ufw-unions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jul/06/new-york-farm-workers-ufw-unions","fields":{"bodyText":"For decades, the United Farm Workers – a powerhouse under American labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez in the 1970s – has declined in size and prominence, its membership falling from 60,000 to around 6,000. Now, after years of scant success in organizing, the UFW has something big to boast about: it has unionized 500 workers at five farms in New York state. It’s the union’s biggest organizing success in years, and the first time the California-based union has organized in the north-east. The New York victories will increase the union’s membership by 8%, with some labor experts saying these successes show new promise and energy in the long-languishing UFW. “It’s extraordinary,” said William B Gould IV, a labor law professor at Stanford and former chairman of the California Agricultural Relations Board. “It’s a sharp contrast with everything we’ve seen. There was considerable lethargy with the UFW. This is a significant departure. It’s very surprising and welcome.” In New York state, the UFW has won union drives at four orchards and one vegetable farm. The vast majority of those unionized are workers from Jamaica or Mexico with H-2A visas to do seasonal work. Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers, told the Guardian that the victories were made possible by a four-year-old New York law – the Farm Laborers Fair Labor Practices Act – which gives farm workers a state-protected right to unionize and prohibits retaliation against farm workers seeking to organize. To ease unionization, the law requires farms to recognize a union once a majority of workers sign pro-union cards. “It’s amazing. When the laws change, workers really can win,” Romero said. Explaining why the workers unionized, she said: “Dignity and respect is one reason. In many cases, the housing for farm workers is deplorable.” Junior Johnson, a Jamaican worker at Wafler Farms, an apple grower, said one reason he backed unionization was the immense pressure to work fast. “We have no say. We have no rights,” Johnson said. “If we go to the morning meeting and a worker wants to complain, the boss says, ‘I don’t want to hear it.’ We have no one beside the union to stand up for us. We have to keep our mouths closed.” Some workers say that if workers speak up, they are told to stay home that day and thus not get paid. Some growers have pressed workers not to sign union cards, telling them they could avoid paying 3% of their pay toward union dues. But Johnson said: “Because of what we go through daily, I’d be happy to pay more than 3% just to have someone to stand up for us.” Owen Salmon, a fellow Wafler worker from Jamaica, said: “If a worker speaks up, you can lose your job” – meaning a seasonal worker is not brought back the following year. “If you don’t speak up, you keep your job.” Santos Mendoza Escamilla, a Mexican worker at Lynn-Ette &amp; Sons, said: “Sometimes we are pushed to work so hard, it doesn’t feel doable. It was always the boss’s word. Now with a union, we feel we have someone pushing back.” The UFW says it has unionized four apple farms – Wafler Farms, Cahoon Farms, Porpiglia and A&amp;J Kirby – and a vegetable grower, Lynn-Ette. The three biggest unionized farms, Wafler, Cahoon and Lynn-Ette, did not respond to questions from the Guardian. Two other unions have also been organizing farm workers in New York: the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) and the United Food and Commercial Workers. They have organized two vineyards, a dairy farm and several other farms, around 125 workers in all. “It was impossible to unionize farm workers before the new law,” said Jessica Garcia, assistant to the president of the Retail Wholesale union. “The new law, it’s made it possible.” Jessica Ramos, a state senator from Queens, was the main sponsor of the farm worker legislation. “This is something that people thought couldn’t be done,” she said, noting that progressive lawmakers had struggled for over a decade to enact the legislation. She said the law passed because in 2018, Democrats won control of the state senate for the first time in a decade, giving the party trifecta control. “We wanted to unapologetically create this environment where the UFW, the RWDSU and other organizations could organize,” Ramos said. “We wanted farmworkers to have a life with dignity.” The National Labor Relations Act, passed in 1935, gave most private-sector workers a federally protected right to unionize. That law did not cover farm workers largely because southern senators wanted to exclude the region’s farm laborers, most of them Black, from coverage. Kerry Kennedy, head of RFK Human Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group, lobbied hard to enact the New York law. Her father, Bobby Kennedy, was a strong supporter of the UFW and Chavez. Kennedy even lobbied in Albany alongside Dolores Huerta, who co-founded the UFW with Chavez. “We became involved with farm workers in New York because they had no right to form a union,” Kennedy said. “They could be fired for attempting to form a union, and they were systematically threatened with deportation if they complained to their employer about working conditions. They had no right to a day off each week. No overtime pay. No unemployment insurance. We worked for about a decade to pass the farm worker Fair Labor Practices Act, and that remedied nearly all those issues.” Romero said she hoped the UFW would create partnerships with unionized farms to help both workers and growers. Steve Ammerman, communications director for the New York Farm Bureau, a growers association which lobbied against the unionization law, said only a handful of farms are going through contract negotiation. He said: “It must be a fair process on both sides of the equation, as there have been concerns raised over questionable tactics and false promises used to encourage farmworkers to sign union authorization cards.” UFW officials denied making any false promises. Ammerman added that higher wages make it more difficult “for farms in particular, to be able to compete in the marketplace”. The UFW is seeking to organize more New York farms to add to its five victories – quite a contrast to California, where there have been just six union elections for farm workers since 2016. Labor experts say it has been hard to unionize farm workers in California because the UFW could not use card check – although a new California law now enables that – and because many farms are large operations and fiercely anti-union. Moreover, newly unionized growers sometimes refused to ever agree to a first contract, a bitter frustration for workers. With California’s new card check law, Antonio De Loera-Brust, the UFW’s communications director, said the successes in New York are “a good preview of what we hope to achieve in California in the next couple of years”. UFW president Romero said that only three states – New York, California and Hawaii – have laws “where farm workers can organize.” UFW officials point to a conflict in Washington state, where a majority of workers at a large mushroom farm voted to unionize, but the company refused to recognize or bargain with the UFW. That state’s law does not require farms to do so. “When you’re able to change the law and make it easier and safer for workers to organize, it is always good,” Romero said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-18T10:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘They enjoyed this’: Ukrainian woman recounts five-month nightmare of torture and imprisonment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","fields":{"bodyText":"Olena Yahupova was first taken by the Russian occupiers in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar last October. Neighbours she knew had informed on her, telling the FSB secret police that her husband was a Ukrainian military officer. What followed, she says, was two days of torture with the secret police – which turned out to be only a prelude to a nightmare of five months of detention and forced labour, during which she also had to act in faked news clips. “There was a complete absence of any source of law, they did whatever they want,” Yahupova says, now speaking in Ukraine, describing the situation in a town after Russia “gradually built up this repression machine” aimed at liquidating opposition and trying to force locals to collaborate. Enerhodar was a city of 53,000 before the war, best known as being the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. A key target for the Russian invaders, it was captured in early March 2022. Dmytro Orlov, its mayor in exile, now based in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, says only 15,000 people are left, a third of whom work at the vast site, and describes a Russian reign of terror unleashed not just on Ukrainian leaders and nuclear plant workers, but also ordinary citizens such as Yahupova. Five hundred people or more, he estimates, have been subject to kidnapping and torture, and electrocuting, he says, is commonplace. Orlov feels he has heard “just too many stories” of violence meted out to Ukrainians. “In the beginning, I felt shock and despair. But now the time has made me feel tougher and rougher.” At first, Yahupova was far from a target. A local government worker, she says she didn’t participate in any anti-Russian protests. But she made the mistake of being slow to leave, concerned about her pets, and one autumn day she was taken by FSB officers to the local police station. “They tied my hands to my ankles,” she begins, demonstrating by bending forward, before she describes being hit around the head with a full plastic bottle. Strangulation was regular – “one guy holding your neck, another pinching your nose” – while they demanded unsuccessfully that she reveal her husband’s location or inform on others with military connections in the town. A wire flex was wrapped around her neck, a gun was placed against her forehead – “Imagine the condition I was in,” she says, speaking quickly – and she says she, too, was electrocuted, although it is something she is understandably reluctant to detail. “Before doing this, they would announce it,” adding to the torture. Yahupova says the violence was the work of a team of five or six FSB officers – “One by one, they would do these things. They enjoyed this” – and recounts being in a state of shock and pain. “I wouldn’t even have time to yell … there was no time to think … often, I was just looking. It was so shocking,” she continues. After two days the torture stopped, but Yahupova was not released. Brought before a senior officer, she was told, “I don’t see any crime here”, but she was detained in a crowded cell, with up to 15 people at a time. Inmates slept on the floor during the winter and on some days no food was provided. She languished in jail until January: “Basically, they forgot about me.” There was one exception. An FSB officer demanded that Yahupova appear on Russian news to complain about alleged Ukrainian shelling. “He threatened to shoot me”, she says, if she didn’t comply. An item was filmed last October, and is still up on RIA Novosti’s Telegram channel, with the strain clearly showing in her eyes. The shelling, she says now, was conducted by Russian forces. Finally, it was decided she would be expelled from the jails, because she was “impossible to re-educate”, and she was relocated close to the front line, near Russian-held Vasylivka, with two employees of the nuclear power plant. Again, she was forced to participate in a faked video, purporting to show her being expelled to Ukraine through a checkpoint, which again appeared on RIA Novosti. But Yahupova was not expelled. “They gave us to the military and left, we were told it was time to work for the Russian Federation. We were made to dig trenches for two months in freezing weather,” she added. “They would bring us before the sunrise and make us leave after the sunset.” Their efforts were monitored by armed guards; it was “kind of a modern gulag”. A release came after another prisoner managed to persuade a soldier to lend them a phone so they could call relatives who were able to trigger an intervention. A squad turned up and took them to Melitopol, where senior Russian police officers said she could go, appearing to recognise that her forced labour was illegal, and presented her “with a business card with three phone numbers on it” in case she had problems. Yahupova had finally been released and returned to Enerhodar. It was March and when she got back “there was nothing in my house”, she says, accusing local police, people she once knew, of stealing her possessions. Almost immediately on her return, the same local police arrived, terrifying her, but they backed off after calling the numbers on the business card, finally allowing her the time to raise money and leave. Compared with what happened before, the final stage of Yahupova’s story was relatively simple. Perhaps because of the police intervention, her name was not listed at any checkpoints, and she was able to pass through one of Moscow’s filtration camps at Berdyansk into Russia proper without being questioned, although other Ukrainians were removed from the bus. After that, she crossed the border to Estonia and freedom. “I was ready to kiss the soil,” she says, when she left the filtration camp. After reaching Estonia, she finally dared to call her husband to tell him she was alive. “My family told me I should stay in Europe”, after what had happened; but she returned to Zaporizhzhia, “where I signed up to be conscripted to the army”, and to celebrate by renewing her wedding vows in church with her lifelong partner. Prior to the war, western intelligence officials warned that the FSB had been tasked with eliminating opposition in captured or surrounded cities, a prediction that appears to have been grimly borne out in Enerhodar. Although she is back in Ukraine safely, Yahupova says she believes, like the mayor, that her case is one of many war crimes: “I think there are other people digging those trenches now, and as for the nuclear power plant workers I was with in January, I fear the worst.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-06T17:03:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war ‘about to enter new phase’ as Russian forces gather in the south, UK intelligence warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed concerns about the shelling the previous day at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying the action showed the risk of a nuclear disaster, Reuters reports. “I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,” director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. He added that military action jeopardising the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant “is completely unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs”. “Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.” Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU) detained two men it accused of being Russian intelligence agents responsible for identifying targets for Russian missile strikes that wrecked shipbulding infrastructure in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, the agency said. The two men “collected and transmitted intelligence to the enemy about important infrastructure facilities, fuel depots, the deployment and movement of personnel and equipment of (Ukraine’s) Armed Forces,” the SBU said in a post on messaging app Telegram. As a result, the SBU said several shipbuilding enterprises and fuel depots were damaged or destroyed. The agency said both men were now being held in custody. It did not say when the infrastructure was hit. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. Amnesty made the comments in a report published on Thursday that drew fierce criticism from the Ukrainian government, Reuters reports. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said on Facebook late on Friday that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, and now understood that she could not get it changed or removed. Pokalchuk said the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion. In an effort to protect civilians, this study became a tool of Russian propaganda”. “It pains me to admit it, but we disagreed with the leadership of Amnesty International on values. That’s why I decided to leave the organization.” Asked about Pokalchuk’s resignation, an Amnesty spokesperson quoted Agnes Callamard, the organisation’s secretary general, as saying: *Oksana has been a valued member of Amnesty staff, and has led the Amnesty International Ukraine office for seven years with many significant human rights successes.” “We are sorry to hear that she is leaving the organization, but we respect her decision and wish her well. Ukrainian officials say they take every possible measure to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it describes as a “special military operation” in Ukraine. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. It was previously reported that North Macedonia would supply Soviet-era tanks but there was no mention of aircraft deliveries. Podolyak said: “Many nations are showing more courage today than half of the G20. “Like North Macedonia, giving Ukraine a (supportive) shoulder in the form of tanks and planes.” It’s 4pm in London and 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The plant has been described as being “a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Meta, formerly Facebook, have removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St. Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high respresentative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy and vice-president of the EU Commission, tweeted: “This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms”, and called for Russian forces occupying the plant to give open access to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The plant has been described as being ““a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Vorosheva said she had no doubt Russia “cynically and deliberately” murdered Ukrainian prisoners of war after fighters were blown up on 29 July in a mysterious and devastating explosion. Moscow claims Ukraine killed them with a US-made precision-guided Himars rocket, but satellite images and independent analysis suggest they were obliterated by a powerful bomb detonated from inside the building. “Russia didn’t want them to stay alive. I’m sure some of those ‘killed’ in the explosion were already corpses. It was a convenient way of accounting for the fact they had been tortured to death,” Vorosheva said. The Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, has posted a photo on his Telegram channel which appears to show the head of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. The Guardian has not confirmed the authenticity of the photo. Geolocation tools suggest it is genuine and was taken in late July, not far from the centre of Popasna. The photo is the latest in a string of apparent atrocities committed by Russian forces since the invasion started in February. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia, Sergei Gaidai, the head of Luhansk military administration has reported on his Telegram channel. The post suggests that campaigning and data collecting is being carried out at events which are being offered to provide support and humanitarian aid to residents of the occupied areas. “Under the guise of providing food or construction materials, the occupying power and the collaborating public movement organise meetings with the population of the recently captured territories of the region,” Gaidai said in the post. According to Gaidai the Russian forces “lure out personal data, urge people to go to the so-called referendum” while “forcing people to exchange their will for food or drinking water”. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify this information. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: Concerns are growing for the safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after an attack by Russian anti-aircraft missiles on 5 August. At the plant, which was severely damaged according to a report on the Telegram account of Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear operator, emergency protection measures have been activated and one of the three working power units was turned off. The post reported the plant remains in the control of the Russian military but added that “Ukrainian staff of the station continue to work and make every effort to ensure nuclear and radiation safety”. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world, generates energy for Ukraine and has been controlled by the Russian military since 4 March when Russian troops captured Energodar, the city where the plant is located. Hello, it’s 11.15am in London and 1.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine.

A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled Tass news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Meta, formerly Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia, according to its newest report into global threats, the Kyiv Independent reports. The accounts, which aimed to create a perception of online support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, posted pro-Russian comments on content shared by social media influencers and media. The physical troll farm was operating out of an office building in St Petersburg, which had 10 days previously prior advertised job postings for “spammers, commenters, content analysts, designers and programmers” focused on the social media platforms, YouTube, Telegram and TikTok. The accounts were targeting politicians, journalists, actors, celebrities and commercial brands from around the world that were vocal in their support for Ukraine. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. The attacks left several thousand people without power or water, as gas and water pipelines and the electricity network were compromised. Oksana Pokalchuk, the head of Amnesty International’s office in Ukraine, has resigned from her role following a report published by the human rights organisation which accused the Ukrainian military of breaching international humanitarian law. The report, which has been criticised by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as well as western diplomats, including the British and US ambassadors to Ukraine, accused the Ukrainian military of putting civilians at risk by positioning themselves in residential areas such as empty schools or civilian buildings, meaning Russia will target urban areas risking civilian lives in the crossfire. Announcing her resignation via Facebook, Pokalchuk said she held meetings with Amnesty International to discuss what they were going to publish but said that her input was “deleted” and replaced with what the organisation published in its report on Thursday. “If you don’t live in a country invaded by invaders and are tearing it to pieces, you probably don’t understand what it’s like to condemn an army of defenders. And there are no words in any language that can convey this to someone who has not felt this pain,” Pokalchuk said. The report has since been used by Kremlin-directed Russian media as a way to evidence their false claims that Russian forces are only going after military targets in Ukraine. Despite ongoing criticism, Amnesty International said that while it condemned Russia’s invasion, the report’s findings were based on evidence gathered during extensive investigations and that it would report Ukrainian violations when it observed them. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: We’ve got more from the UK’s MoD. On what Ukraine’s troops are focusing on, it adds: Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links with growing frequency in Ukraine’s southern regions. Including the strategically important railroad spur that links Kherson to Russian-occupied Crimea, almost certainly using a combination of block, damage, degrade, deny, destroy, and disrupt effects to try to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply. The MoD then adds it believes the war is about to enter a “new phase”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with the heaviest fighting shifting to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper River. As we just mentioned, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has revealed there is a significant build-up of Russian forces in southern Ukraine. However, the MoD said it was unclear whether these additional forces were for a new assault on Ukrainian territory or in anticipation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. It reported: Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, towed artillery, and other weapons continue to move away from Ukraine’s Donbas region and are headed south-west. Equipment was also reported to be moving from Russian-occupied Melitopol, Berdiansk, Mariupol and from mainland Russia via the Kerch Bridge into Crimea. Battalion tactical groups (BTG), which comprise between 800 and 1,000 troops, have been deployed to Crimea and would almost certainly be used to support Russian troops in the Kherson region. On 02 August 2022, a new BTG had been deployed to Crimea and BTGs are also being re-deployed from Eastern Grouping of Forces. These will highly likely be sent into the Kherson region in the coming days. Good morning, it’s approaching 7.30am in London and 9.30am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine Ukraine has accused Russian forces of strikes near a nuclear reactor at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant in the country’s south-east. Energoatom, the state-run operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday.

Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. The Russian president welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed grain exports from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-26T10:22:29Z","webTitle":"Prigozhin mutiny was monster acting against his creator, says top EU diplomat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","fields":{"bodyText":"Yevgeny Prigozhin’s aborted mutiny in Russia was “the monster acting against his creator”, the EU’s foreign policy chief has said. “The political system is showing fragilities, and the military power is cracking,” Josep Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg as he arrived for a meeting with ministers from across the 27-member bloc. Wagner group mercenary forces under Prigozhin seized control of military headquarters in southern Russia and began to move towards Moscow on Saturday before suddenly heading back to eastern Ukraine after a deal with the Kremlin. “The most important conclusion is the war against Ukraine launched by Putin and the monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is fighting, the monster is acting against his creator,” Borrell said. Borrell said the instability in Russia was dangerous given its nuclear arsenal and would be top of the agenda at the Luxembourg summit, where ministers voted through a promise to top up Ukraine’s military funds by €3.5bn (£3bn). After the daylong summit, Borrell said the EU’s view of the future of Russia had changed in the wake of what he described as an “armed insurrection”. “It is clear now that our vision of Russia is quite different. It is not just a threat because it has military capability of provoking war, which it has shown already, but also internal political instability,” he said, without elaborating on scenarios he said ministers had discussed. “Certainly it is not a good thing to see that a nuclear power like Russia is going into a phase of political instability,” he said. EU foreign ministers were scrambling to digest the fallout from the mutiny at their meeting. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said Putin was destroying his own country with his “brutal war of aggression” in Ukraine. “We are seeing massive cracks in the Russian propaganda,” she added. Baerbock said the EU would focus on helping Ukraine in its fight to let its people live in peace and freedom. The Swedish minister Tobias Billström said it was too early to do an analysis but that the weekend’s events brought Ukraine’s potential membership of the EU into sharp focus. The most important thing was supporting Ukraine so it could win back its territory, he added. “We will have a good opportunity to sit down and talk about the future policy with regard to Ukraine, when it comes to EU integration,” Billström said ahead of the summit. “And when it comes to giving both political, military, humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, until Ukraine has restored its territorial integrity completely.” Finland’s new foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, said: “It’s too early to tell where this will lead to. But of course, it’s pretty obvious that the events of the weekend will have continued effect on how Putin is seen internally, but also on how Russia is seen to the outside world. “It is common for authoritarian states that everything seems to be very stable until one day, nothing is stable any more. And I expect such a development for Russia as well.” Ministers approved the 11th round of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping Putin circumventing previous sanctions by using third countries to ship crude oil and other products around the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T12:05:47Z","webTitle":"BBC Singers/LSO review – music, and words, of power as Rattle protests vandalism of UK’s musical life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/24/bbc-singers-lso-review-music-and-words-of-power-as-rattle-protests-vandalism-of-uks-musical-life","fields":{"bodyText":"Mahler’s Seventh Symphony was originally intended as the sole work in this evening’s concert. Such, however, was the outrage over the threat to so many of the UK’s classical music ensembles and companies that the LSO invited the now reprieved BBC Singers to perform Poulenc’s Figure humaine as well, as a gesture of solidarity. Speaking after the interval, Simon Rattle protested how “the Arts Council’s swingeing cuts in November” and “the proposed vandalism by the BBC” have affected the musical life of this country, angrily inveighing the “political ignorance of what this artform entails” and the “stubborn pride in that ignorance” on the part of those who have wreaked such havoc. Poulenc’s piece itself carries enormous symbolic resonance. Written in secret under Nazi occupation in 1943-44, and an iconic Resistance work, it sets texts by Paul Éluard for two a cappella six-part choruses. Poulenc initially intended it for French choirs after the Liberation, but given the complexity of its vocal writing, he eventually allocated it to the BBC Singers (known at the time as the BBC Chorus), who gave the first performance in March 1945. Hearing them sing it is a reminder both of their greatness as an ensemble, and of their centrality as interpreters in musical history. It was done with fierce intelligence and great conviction. Rattle gave the music space for dissonances and detail to register without fracturing tensions or momentum, and the emotional trajectory from quiet anger to the tremendous closing demand for freedom was exactingly and thrillingly plotted. Mahler’s Seventh was often superb, too. The opening movement was a rollercoaster ride, a thing of jolts, contrasts, mood swings and moments of beauty. Rattle’s attention to detail in Mahler emerged in the central nocturnes and scherzo, swivelling between retro Romantic nostalgia and fragmentary anticipations of the worlds of Schoenberg and Berg: the second Nachtmusik sounded particularly gorgeous here. The bucolic finale can so often seem at a tangent from the rest of the work and did so here, despite the energy Rattle brought to it. The playing was virtuosic in its brilliance throughout."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/09/projection-deception-sunak-staying-in-power-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T06:00:12Z","webTitle":"They call it ‘projection’ but it’s a grand deception.

A recent cover essay of the Spectator struck a similar note, claiming a “new woke elite” is now “destined to rule over an increasingly divided and embittered society”. Pieces in the Sun, Mail and the Times raised the same alarm. The diagnosis is clear: don’t be fooled by the Conservatives’ long residence in No 10 – a cabal of middle-class liberals, out of step with the public and covertly led by Gary Lineker, is really ruling Britain. It’s hard not to feel like we’ve been here before. Wasn’t the Tories’ triumph over the European Union supposed to free Britain from the grip of unelected elites, once and for all? Alas, no sooner did the Conservatives slay one set of out-of-touch rulers than another one arose in their place – the bureaucrats in Brussels have morphed seamlessly into a new progressive aristocracy, comprising everyone from civil servants to junior doctors to the judiciary, opposing the Conservatives’ singular right to rule over Britain unopposed. Yet again, the Conservatives are the ones who represent “real” Britain, while their opponents are anti-democratic and unpatriotic, deploying all kinds of nefarious means to obstruct the people’s will. Psychologists have a word for this phenomenon: projection – the process by which someone displaces their own negative traits or insecurities on to someone else. The Conservatives have long excelled in using projection as a political weapon. While it is their party that defends the interests of bosses, property owners and those with inherited wealth, they claim Labour is driven by elite self-interest. While they happily take donations from oligarchs, it’s the left that is under the sway of foreign powers. The Tories love nothing more than to reign over Westminster and Fleet Street while raging against what Margaret Thatcher called the enemy within. Such narratives have been pushed by the party and its supporters ever since the Labour party came into existence. “The British Labour party, as it impudently calls itself, is not British at all,” the Mail declared in November 1923, as its proprietor impudently cosied up to Benito Mussolini on the continent. And they have been endlessly useful. Not only does the persistence of an “enemy within” or “new elite” exonerate the Tories’ failures in government – implying that actually existing Conservatism has never been tried and so justifying the seizure of more power – but it also implausibly places the wealthy Tory elite and the proverbial “man on the street” on the same side, jointly opposed to this undemocratic foe. Ever since the dawn of Britain’s democracy, Conservatives have had to find extravagant ways to make this outlandish positioning convincing. For a long time, empire and monarchy gave them the unifying cause they craved. With the globe beneath Britain’s paw, even those at the bottom of the hierarchy at home could be encouraged to look down on all others abroad: to be born English, the famous saying went, was to have won first prize in the lottery of life, whether you were a butler or a baron. But after the second world war and the dissolution of empire, the Tories needed a new way to distort and disguise Britain’s divides. They found it at Britain’s borders. “It is possible that Tory attitudes on immigration will strike a working-class response and replace the old-style imperialism,” the influential Conservative MP John Biffen wrote in 1965. Enoch Powell delivered his “rivers of blood” speech three years later. They never looked back. In Powell’s reconfiguration of post-imperial Britain, the world was no longer beneath Britain’s paw but instead queueing at the gates, desperate to be let in. This narrative, advanced by his disciple Thatcher and sustained by every Tory leader since, has proved similarly empowering, and even more useful: it offers the Conservatives not only a way of appealing across classes, but an alibi for the miserable state of the country’s public services and economy. If Britain is no longer great, it is because it is too generous, spreading its greatness so thinly that the nation’s “native” citizens suffer for it. Any leftwing or liberal defence of immigration can be held up as proof of treachery: whose side are they on? But despite their patriotic odes to the British people, the Conservatives remain a fundamentally elitist and anti-democratic force. They are wedded to an unrepresentative political system that allows the party to frame fine-margin victories – often involving the votes of little more than a quarter of the electorate – as towering majorities. Just as austerity deliberately eroded local democracy, curtailing the power of opposition-led councils to improve people’s lives, the Tories’ latest move to push through voter ID under a fictitious threat of voter fraud – a measure that is likely to disfranchise millions of people, most of them less well-off – represents yet another move to disempower the public. It is a naked articulation of the Conservatives’ method: muzzle Britain in the name of protecting it, shoring up their own power. The result is confounding: a ruling class that refuses to take any responsibility for ruling, an elite that enriches its chums while calling their opponents self-serving, a vandal that imagines itself the victim. As long ago as 1871, the novelist Anthony Trollope saw this duplicity as a feature of the Conservative mind. “They feel among themselves that everything that is being done is bad – even though that everything is done by their own party,” he wrote in the novel The Eustace Diamonds. “To have been always in the right and yet always on the losing side … A huge, living, daily increasing grievance that does one no palpable harm, is the happiest possession that a man can have.” More than 150 years later, Trollope’s words have an eerie resonance. Conservatives feel that everything that is being done is bad, even though almost all of it is done by them. They lament the state of the nation even as they lead it. Last week’s local election results suggest the public’s patience may be fading. But while the Tories may mourn Britain’s decline, so long as they remain in power, they seem happy in their unhappiness, confident that there will always be someone else to blame, someone else to suffer the consequences.

The oratorio, a Three Choirs commission, was first performed in 1999, its reappearance at this year’s festival comes in the wake of it being voted, during 2020’s lockdown, festival audience’s favourite premiere. Twenty-four years on, neither its subject matter nor its musical style feels any the less contemporary or relevant. In his seven-movement structure, Pott sets texts including Walt Whitman, George Mackay Brown, Randall Jarrell and Charles Causley, as well as psalms and anonymous 15th-century words which, while reflecting on the humanity of Christ, also suggest Christ as Everyman in a world where every continuing atrocity is a crucifixion repeated. The work’s emphasis on the pity of war makes it feels like a requiem, against the rosy hue of the Miłosz poem and its insistence that “No one believes it is happening now”. References to the Earth burning – Georg Heym’s “Forests fall to the consuming flames” and Mervyn Peake’s “fires dance like madmen on the splinters” felt newly chilling – the picture of man’s war on man now also invoking man’s heedless war on the planet. In Gloucester’s acoustic, such outbursts could not fail to resonate, yet the music’s quiet passages, where dissonant harmonies emerged most clearly, were also eloquent, with the two extremes of fierce and hushed tellingly juxtaposed in lines first by Thomas Traherne and then Dylan Thomas. At 70 minutes, the oratorio is long, but it’s testimony to Pott’s command of his choral and orchestral resources, together with the three soloists, soprano April Frederick, mezzo Clare Presland and baritone Marcus Farnsworth, that it didn’t drag. In the first half, conductor Adrian Partington, Gloucester’s artistic director, had chosen Holst’s Ode to Death – as serene as it is forceful – as a fitting parallel. That also sat well with the emotional surge and swell of Arnold Bax’s Tintagel, wonderfully conveyed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. By comparison, Randall Svane’s opening Quantum Flight, given its UK premiere here, had fizzed along, an antidote to the sobriety of what was to come. • Three Choirs festival at Gloucester continues until 29 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T16:05:32Z","webTitle":"China and Germany condemn Russian threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/04/scholz-china-germany-visit-lets-work-together-says-xi","fields":{"bodyText":"Xi Jinping and Olaf Scholz have condemned Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, with both leaders expressing their desire for the conflict to end. The Chinese president stressed the need for greater cooperation between China and Germany in what he referred to as “times of change and turmoil”, and said both leaders “jointly oppose the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,” although he stopped short of criticising Russia or calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops. The German chancellor said Russia was in danger of “crossing a line” in the international community if it used atomic weapons, in what was the first meeting with his Chinese counterpart. Scholz’s inaugural one-day visit on Friday was the first by a leader of a G7 nation to China in three years, and was viewed as testing the waters of relations between Beijing and the west after years of mounting tensions, analysts say. Observers said Scholz’s visit was being viewed in China as a welcome development as the country’s leadership looks to consolidate its relations with the outside world after years of isolation during the pandemic. For his part, Scholz was looking to achieve greater market access at a time when the German economy is struggling with inflation and an imminent recession, largely fuelled by the energy crisis. Scholz defended his decision to travel to China with a group of industrial representatives, which has been viewed with controversy at home, telling journalists: “It is good and right that I am in Beijing today.” He said in time of crisis, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, bilateral meetings were all the more important. In a meeting with China’s outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, Scholz said he had urged Xi to use China’s influence as a permanent member of the UN security council on Russia to bring an end to the invasion of Ukraine. “I told president Xi that it is important for China to exercise its influence on Russia,” he said. During their meeting, which was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Xi said that as large nations with influence, China and Germany should work together all the more during “times of change and turmoil” for the sake of world peace, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. “As long as the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground while reserving differences, exchanges and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation are upheld, the general direction of bilateral relations will not be deviated, and the pace of progress will be stable,” Xi was quoted as saying by CCTV. “At present, the international situation is complex and changeable. As influential powers, China and Germany should work together in times of change and chaos to make more contributions to world peace and development.” Over lunch Scholz told Xi it was important both leaders were meeting in person during tense times, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine creating problems for the rules-based global order, according to a Reuters reporter accompanying Scholz’s delegation. At a news conference after his meeting with Li, Scholz said he had raised the issue of Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory over which it will not exclude using weapons in order to bring it under its control. “Like the US and other countries, we are pursuing a one-China policy,” he said. “But I have made equally clear that any change in Taiwan’s status quo must be peaceful or by mutual consent.” The two leaders also discussed Europe-China relations, the climate crisis and global hunger, as well as how to develop China-Germany economic ties, which Scholz said had “become more difficult for German companies recently” because of China sealing off access to many of its market sectors. Li nominally has responsibility over China’s economy. According to German media who accompanied him, Scholz indirectly admonished China over its failures to protect minorities in China. He told Xi that human rights were universal, especially the rights of minorities and pledged to “want to remain in discussion” with China about the situation in the province of Xinjiang, which is allegedly home to hundreds of interment camps in which more than 1 million Uyghurs are believed to be held. China’s strict zero-Covid policy and growing tensions with the west have made it unfeasible for leaders of major western powers to visit China. Xi himself has only just resumed foreign trips. Scholz’s visit is probably a welcome development for China’s leadership, which will be looking to shore up relations with the outside world after the conclusion of the 20th party congress, where Xi consolidated his status as the core of the ruling Communist party. In the run-up to the visit, there had been criticism from within the EU and the German government coalition, mainly from the Green party and the Liberals.
