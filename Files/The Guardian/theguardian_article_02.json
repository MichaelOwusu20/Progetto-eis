China’s state institutions were aggressively targeting the UK, the all-party intelligence and security committee (ISC) said, and “without swift and decisive action” a nightmare scenario could emerge where China represented not just a commercial challenge but an existential threat to liberal democratic systems. The committee, which completed its inquiry into the Chinese threat in May, was scathing about the failure of the UK to wake up to the scale of the challenge. “We found that the level of resource dedicated to tackling the threat posed by China’s ‘whole of state’ approach has been completely inadequate, and the slow speed at which strategies and policies are developed and implemented leaves a lot to be desired,” the ISC said. Until recently the UK government was willing to accept Chinese money with few questions asked, the ISC said, and “as a consequence the UK is now playing catch-up and the whole of government has its work cut out to understand and counter the threat from China”. The failure to respond to the economic threat posed by China, and to put in place a way of protecting UK assets “is a serious failure and one that the UK may feel the consequences of for years to come”, the parliamentarians found. The committee said: “There is no evidence that Whitehall policy departments have the necessary resources, expertise or knowledge of the threat to counter China’s approach.” The government’s focus, the report said, was still dominated by short-term or acute threats. “It has consistently failed to think long-term unlike China, which historically has been able to take advantage of this.” In a scathing assessment of British academia’s willingness to accept Chinese research grants, the report said, that “while some have expressed concern others seem willing to turn a blind eye, happy simply to take the money”. “Academia is an easy option when it comes to the theft of intellectual property, with China taking advantage of collaborative projects to steal information which may be less protected,” it said, adding: “It is alarming there is still no single list of the areas of sensitive UK research which needs protecting.” Finding that the west was generally too reliant on Chinese technology, the report said that “without swift and decisive action we are on a trajectory for a nightmare scenario where China steals blueprints, sets standards and builds products, exerting political and economic influence at every step. This presents a serious commercial challenge but also has the potential to pose an existential threat to liberal democratic systems.” The committee also said that allowing China to invest in the UK’s civil nuclear programme was in effect ceding control to the Chinese Communist party. Ministers have been adopting a less confrontational approach to China, insisting engagement is necessary if major problems such as the climate crisis are to be jointly addressed. In response to the report, Rishi Sunak said China posed an epoch-defining challenge to the international order. “The government has already taken actions that are in line with many of the committee’s recommendations,” the prime minister said. Julian Lewis, the chair of the committee, said he found the government response to its work had been defensive and that the committee had remained in continual dialogue with the intelligence agencies after the formal end of evidence-taking. He claimed that overall the government response was “a reiteration of precisely the sort of policy that we are saying does not take security seriously”. He accused the government of having “a record of resistance to allowing this committee to exercise proper oversight”. The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. The report was published as Germany released its first comprehensive strategy on Thursday on how Europe’s largest economy should deal with China. Drawn up by the cabinet of Olaf Scholz, the strategy would give the current and future governments a “compass for our relationships”, Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, tweeted. “We need China, but China also needs Europe.” Baerbock acknowledged that Germany needed to cooperate with China on an economic level, but it had to reduce the dangers of being too dependent on a single country. “We don’t want to disconnect from China, but to reduce our risks,” she said. The more diverse Germany’s trade and supply chains were, “the more resilient our country will be”. The strategy paper described China as Germany’s “partner, competitor and systemic rival”. It said the government’s aim was to ensure that dependencies in “critical areas”, such as medicine, energy provision and security, were reduced to a minimum “in order to reduce the emanating risks”.

Pita Limjaroenrat’s progressive Move Forward party, which campaigned on a promise of change after nine years of rule by a former army chief, gained the most votes two months ago, but election rules rewritten after a military coup in 2014 require him to have majority support from parliament to become prime minister. He had formed a coalition with other opposition parties that was expected to grant him 312 votes, but to reach the threshold of 375, Pita also needed to win support from MPs outside his bloc or unelected senators in the upper house. However, all the current senators were appointed by the military and are seen as part of the conservative establishment. Pita ran unopposed in the vote but failed to gain a majority in parliament, made up of 749 members. Only 324 supported him, including 13 senators, while 182 voted against. A further 199 abstained. Speaking after the vote, Pita said he accepted the result but that he was not going to give up. “Thank you for the 13 votes [from senators] who are brave enough to reflect [the] people’s voice,” he said. “I understand there’s a lot of pressure on them, as well as several incentives that didn’t allow them to vote in alignment with the people. But I’m not giving up, I’m going to strategise once again.” The comment sections of livestreams broadcasting the vote were filled with anger towards senators, saying they had failed to respect the will of the people and that those who had abstained were a waste of taxpayers’ money. Near to parliament, shipping containers were stacked and razor wire was put on overpasses to deter demonstrations. Move Forward had campaigned on the promise of major reform, including breaking up monopolies, ending military conscription, removing the military’s influence from politics and amending a strict law that forbids criticism of the monarchy. The pledge on the monarchy is highly controversial among conservatives and, in a parliamentary session before the vote, it was repeatedly cited as a reason why senators and MPs would not support him. Some accused Pita of risking chaos and seeking to undermine the royal family. One senator, Seree Suwanpanont, said: “It’s clear that this operation is aiming to overthrow [the royals]. How can we, the senators, support you to do this?” Two days have been set aside next week for a repeat of the ballot and Pita can run again. If he does so, he is unlikely to be able to garner enough support to pass, said Punchada Sirivunnabood, an associate professor at Mahidol University. “For the senate, it’s going to be very difficult for [Move Forward] to get more votes in the second round, and the dangerous thing is [that] those who voted [for Pita] might be lobbied by other senators to not vote in the second round,” she said. Adding to Pita’s troubles, he is facing two legal cases in the constitutional court, including over an allegation that he breached election rules by owning media shares, which he denies. The second case centres on a claim that his pledge to reform lese-majesty law, which protects the monarchy from criticism, amounted to an attempt “to overthrow the democratic regime of government with the king as a head of state”. Thailand has some of the world’s strictest such legislation, under which criticism of the royals can lead to up to 15 years in prison. More than 250 people, including children, have been charged under the law since 2020. In parliament, Pita insisted that the allegations against him were unproven and he was still eligible to become prime minister. He also sought to allay concerns over his stance on the royal family, saying he believed that the Thai monarchy would continue. He said he was concerned that the institution and the lese-majesty law were being used as tools for political attacks. “Several groups are trying to block me because they are losing benefits,” Pita said, adding that the same people used the monarchy as a pretext to oppose change. “It’s time for us to face this problem maturely and solve it at its root, by ending the use of the monarchy in political conflicts, and finding a way to maintain good relations between the king and the people in these changing times, in line with a modern democratic society.” It is likely that Move Forward’s coalition partner, Pheu Thai, the party associated with the exiled leader Thaksin Shinawatra, will put forward a candidate for either the second or third ballot. A scenario where a Pheu Thai candidate is selected as prime minister may be acceptable to some voters, including those who want to oust Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been in power since the coup, said Punchada. But young people are less likely to be satisfied with this arrangement, she added, saying they will protest, though it is unclear whether they will be able to sustain demonstrations. Napon Jatusripitak, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, said the events in parliament could “ignite substantial frustration and discontent among the public, particularly among those who feel that the democratic process has been undermined by actors or institutions that appear to prioritise interests other than the popular will”. Crowds gathered in central Bangkok on Wednesday evening, some holding signs that read “respect my vote” and “senators don’t vote against the people’s will”. Arnon Nampa, a human rights lawyer and activist at the forefront of the monarchy reform protests of 2020, told those assembled: “Tomorrow, if we are betrayed, if we are prevented from having a government elected by the people, we will definitely stand up and fight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/01/zelenskiy-warns-russia-could-be-ready-to-provoke-nuclear-plant-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T15:55:20Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy: Russia may be preparing to trigger nuclear plant explosion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/01/zelenskiy-warns-russia-could-be-ready-to-provoke-nuclear-plant-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/01/zelenskiy-warns-russia-could-be-ready-to-provoke-nuclear-plant-explosion","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia could be ready to provoke a localised explosion at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy has said. Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information and called for greater international attention to the situation at the facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. Since seizing it last year, Moscow has turned it into a military base from which it has bombarded Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Earlier on Friday, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) claimed that Russian troops were reducing their presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency’s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged that Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four of the six power units, as well as a cooling pond. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. On Thursday Ukraine conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the power station, regional officials said. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, replied saying that he had written to the UN security council and secretary general, António Guterres, to state: “We do not intend to blow up this NPP [nuclear power plant], we have no intention of doing so.” In a separate development, the US army general, Mark Milley, told the National Press Club in Washington that Ukraine’s counteroffensive could take up to “10 weeks” and be “very, very bloody”. “War on paper and real war are different,” Milley said. “In real war, real people die. Real people are on those frontlines and real people are in those vehicles. Real bodies are being shredded by high explosives.” Milley said the counteroffensive was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields … 500 metres a day, 1,000 metres a day, 2,000 metres” – and that he was not surprised progress was slower than some people and computers had predicted. “What I had said was, this is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks. It’s going to be very difficult,” he added. “It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that.” The US is also considering approving the transfer of controversial cluster munition warheads to Ukraine to boost Kyiv’s counteroffensive, CNN reported. Officials told CNN that “a final decision is expected soon from the White House, and that if approved, the weapons could be included in a new military aid package to Ukraine as soon as next month”. Cluster bombs are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area, but the smaller munitions do not always explode, posing a future risk to civilians. The bombs were banned under international law by a treaty that has been signed by more than 100 countries – but not Russia, the US or Ukraine. Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, the CIA director, William Burns, made a secret trip to Ukraine, where officials outlined a strategy to take back control of Russian-occupied territories and bring the war to an end. Overnight the Post reported that Burns had recently travelled to Ukraine to meet Zelenskiy and Ukrainian intelligence officials. During the trip, the officials revealed a Ukrainian strategy to recapture territories occupied by the Russians as well as their endgame to open peace talks with Moscow with a view to ending the war. According to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Burns recently called the Russian spy chief, Sergei Naryshkin, after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia, to reassure the Kremlin that the US had no role in it.

Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam destroyed, flooding the frontline Southern Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric station were largely destroyed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. Ukraine blamed Russia for the destruction of the dam wall that forced thousands to evacuate. If Kremlin-installed “governor” Vladimir Saldo was trying to project a sense of calm among the deluged frontline towns and villages of Russian-occupied Kherson region, he was failing miserably, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote. Saldo, dressed in camouflage and helmet and sitting in front of the flooded remains of the town centre of Nova Kakhovka, claimed that the city was “alive”. But the reality of the catastrophe was playing out around him: people stranded on the roofs of their houses and flats, begging for those with boats to come and save them. Dozens missing and whole towns downriver washed away. Satellite images would later reveal the extent of the disaster, while a Guardian team created a visual guide to the disaster on the hours after it unfolded. Russia’s UN envoy was accused of floundering in a “mud of lies” after he claimed at an emergency session of the security council that Ukraine destroyed the dam in a “war crime”, Patrick Wintour reported. At first, even as the waters were rising, Viktor Ivankhnenko hoped the one-storey home he had built on a Russian-occupied island in the Dnipro River would be safe. But as day wore into night, it became clear his optimism was misplaced. By 3am on Wednesday, Viktor, 66, and his wife, Nadiia, knew it was time to leave. Packing up what possessions they could, they got into a boat and paddled desperately to a neighbour’s two-storey house as the waters enveloped their own. Rescuers had brought the couple to Kherson by boat on Wednesday lunchtime, delivering them to a makeshift port that before the flooding was a nondescript urban crossroads. On Monday it had been 500 metres from the banks of the river, Dan Sabbagh reported, but then the dam upstream at Nova Kakhovka had burst. As the country’s agrarian and food ministry warned that the fields of southern Ukraine could “turn into deserts” by next year, Julian Borger wrote that the devastation could take decades to heal. Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant at risk, report says The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse, Julian Borger reports, as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant’s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. The UN’s nuclear watchdog also confirmed that plant can rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months’ worth of water. The counteroffensive appears to enter its preliminary stages The current fog of war in Ukraine is in large part artificially generated: “Plans love silence,” Kyiv observed in a typically well-executed video released on social media on Sunday, showing its soldiers holding fingers to their lips. After months of speculation, and amid perceptible impatience in some foreign capitals, its long-awaited counteroffensive appears at last to be in its preliminary stages, the Guardian wrote in its editorial. For weeks now the Ukrainian army has been carrying out “shaping” or tactical operations around a vast 600-mile frontline, stretching from the south to the north-east. The goal is to wipe out Russia’s military potential, Luke Harding reported. Ukrainian units have used attack drones to destroy enemy tanks and positions in night-time missions. There have been longer-range strikes against weapons depots and fuel dumps. Kyiv has used British Storm Shadow missiles to target eastern cities such as Luhansk, taken over by Russia in 2014, and the occupied ports of Mariupol and Berdiansk. By Thursday, there was intense fighting south of Zaporizhzhia and Zelenskiy was hailing “results” in Donetsk. Nato members may send troops to Ukraine, warns former alliance chief A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states including the US do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliance’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Rasmussen, who has been acting as official adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Ukraine’s place in a future European security architecture, has been touring Europe and Washington to gauge the shifting mood before the critical summit starts on 11 July. He also warned that even if a group of states did provide Ukraine with security guarantees, others would not allow the issue of Ukraine’s future Nato membership to be kept off the agenda at Vilnius. Patrick Wintour reported this story. Wagner captures Russian commander Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner group of mercenaries has captured a Russian commander, Pjotr Sauer reported, as the notorious leader further escalates his feud with the regular army. In a video posted on Prigozhin’s social media channels, Lt Col Roman Venevitin, the commander of Russia’s 72nd Brigade, tells an interrogator that, while drunk, he had ordered his troops to fire on a Wagner convoy. In the footage, which resembled clips of prisoner of war soldiers, Venevitin said he acted because of his “personal dislike” for Wagner and then apologised. Last week, Prigozhin accused the Russian army of trying to blow up his men as they were pulling back from the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut. Two-year-old girl killed in Russian missile attack on Dnipro A two-year-old girl was found dead under the rubble of a house near the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro as recriminations continued about the availability of air raid shelters in the capital. Serhiy Lysak, the governor of the Dnipro region, said another 22 people were injured, including five children, in an attack that destroyed or damaged several buildings. “Overnight, the body of a girl who had just turned two was pulled from under the rubble of a house,” said the governor. The girl was called Lisa and was with her mother when the missile struck in the yard of the house, he said. Three boys aged 15, 11 and six were in intensive care after the missile strike, suffering from concussions and multiple fractures. All three had to be operated on to help their recovery, the governor said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T04:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘It looks like Mars’: Nikopol locals on life without water after dam explosion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","fields":{"bodyText":"Anna Supranova stood in front of what was once a vast artificial sea. Her home – at no 7 Hetman Street – looks on to Kakhovka reservoir in southern Ukraine. Or at least it did. The water has recently vanished. Most of it disappeared in the space of three surreal days last month, after Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam farther downstream. Ever since, Supranova and other residents in the frontline town of Nikopol have been without water. At the bottom of her garden is an unearthly and desolate muddy plain. It stretches as far as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, visible in the near haze. The civilian facility – occupied by Moscow since the beginning of its invasion – is 5km away. The Russians have transformed the nuclear plant into a full-blown military base. According to Ukrainian intelligence, they have mined its six reactors and a cooling pond. Armoured vehicles shelter in its halls. In an ominous development, staff who have signed contracts with Rosatom – the Kremlin’s nuclear agency – have been told to leave. Three senior figures have gone to Crimea, with routine patrols scaled back. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that Vladimir Putin is plotting a “terrorist attack”, and has urged the international community to act. “We have been saying for a long time that there is a serious threat. Because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the plant, which could lead to the release of dangerous substances into the air. We communicate this very clearly,” he said on Saturday. The town of Nikopol – current population 50,000 – and other nearby cities are taking the threat seriously. Last week for the first time they carried out radiation drills, a rehearsal for what locals should do in case of a repeat of the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, when contamination blew from Ukraine to Belarus, and across Europe to Scandinavia. It was the world’s worst ever civil nuclear incident. “The Zaporizhzhia plant is on my doorstep. You can see it,” Supranova said. “If there is a nuclear leak we will fetch the dog, go inside and close the windows and doors. Unfortunately we don’t have a car. We won’t get far on foot.” She, her husband, Serhiy, and 15-year-old daughter, Angelina, would wait for rescue. “I’m not sure who exactly would come,” she admitted. Speaking on Monday, the Nikopol military district chief Yevhen Yevtushenko said the situation was under control. Radiation levels were normal. There was no sign that the Russians were leaving the plant in big numbers, he said. The authorities were not planning a forced evacuation – for now. Since Russia’s all-out attack in February 2022 about half of the town’s population had moved to safer areas, he said. Asked what the west might do to mitigate the situation, he answered wryly: “Make the Russians disappear. The safety issues with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant only started when they showed up. If we can get rid of them the problems will go as well.” Thus far, the response from EU nations and the US to the developing crisis was unimpressive and “lethargic”. “An explosion would be a catastrophe for the Black Sea region, for Europe and humanity,” he stressed. Russia’s reckless sabotage of the dam left 200,000 people in the district without drinking water, he added. Levels at the reservoir continued to fall. The town was delivering water in fire trucks, and distributing it free of charge. It briefly reappeared in domestic taps, only to stop flowing half an hour later. In addition to a growing nuclear threat, Nikopol has for the past year come under regular Russian bombardment. Soldiers based in the plant and in the next-door village of Vodiane shell the town most days or hit it with Grad missiles. On 26 June two civilians were killed and one injured. The Russians are so close that there is no warning when a strike might occur or where a projectile will land. Outside Nikopol’s shrapnel-pitted palace of culture, pensioner Oleksandr Sherban described the Russians as “idiots”. “Nobody knows what’s going to happen, or what they are capable of doing. They’ve mined everything,” he said. “Their bombing is completely unpredictable. It can happen any time of the day: morning or night. I think they do it whenever they’ve had a good meal.” Sherban said Vladimir Putin was trying to use the nuclear plant for blackmail. The move was connected to Ukraine’s counter-offensive and its attempt to liberate the Zaporizhzhia region. He described the Russian-seized town of Enerhodar – adjacent to the plant and home to its atomic engineers – as “beautiful”. “I used to travel there by ferry. You could go across the reservoir in a boat,” he recalled. Olexiy Kovynyev, a former senior nuclear worker who fled from Enerhodar last year, said the situation at the plant was tense. About 2,500 from its original 11,500 Ukrainian staff remained, he estimated. Many of those who stayed had – under pressure – signed contracts to work with Rosatom. They included its Ukrainian chief engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, whom the Russians promoted to director. “There are conflicts between those who collaborated, and those who didn’t,” he said. Kovynyev said that the plant’s reactors were impregnable, and encased in thick steel and concrete. More vulnerable was a dry storage area – home to spent radioactive fuel – and the cooling pond. “An explosion there would likely be contained. Of course if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels radiation would be thrown out,” he said. Kovynyev described the destruction of the Soviet-built reservoir as terrible. “It looks like Mars, an arid desert,” he said. “Before it was a sea. I would swim in it. Every summer I would go to Enerhodar’s beach, take my sleeping bag and bed down for the night under the stars. It was wonderful.” He said he remained optimistic that a Chornobyl-style catastrophe might be avoided. A billboard on the way into town reads: “Nikopol. Home to indomitable people.” The route in passes a snaking estuary – now entirely dried up, and devoid of life apart from a few gulls. The city was once a Cossack stronghold and the centre of a self-governing area known as the Zaporizhian Sich. Many of its modern factories are still working. Some people who left last year ran out of money, and came back, residents said. Acting headteacher Svitlana Karamushka said locals had got used to living in a war zone. Many families had stayed and children learned online, she said. She had prepared a suitcase in case she needed to evacuate, and had taken part in a training session on what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion. “You have to wash victims,” she said. Who was to blame for this horrible situation? “Putin. He’s a prick,” her friend Nataliya said. Back in Hetman Street, Supranova said the sudden disappearance of water was killing off her vegetable patch. The garden included apple trees, and a luscious trailing vine, which blanketed most of her cottage. “I’ve planted potatoes. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to harvest them,” she admitted. She added: “I’ve lived here my entire life, 36 years. I really don’t want to go. We hope for the best and prepare for the worst.” Luke Harding’s Invasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, is now available in paperback from Guardian Faber"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/05/the-public-can-power-britain-to-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T17:37:44Z","webTitle":"The public can power Britain to net zero | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/05/the-public-can-power-britain-to-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/05/the-public-can-power-britain-to-net-zero","fields":{"bodyText":"You report that the UK government has made almost no progress on its climate plans and is in danger of not delivering on its world-leading net zero plans (UK missing climate targets on nearly every front, say government’s advisers, 28 June). We offer a small ray of hope. It’s us. Despite a disappointing increase in negative coverage about net zero, our world-leading targets still enjoy widespread public support. The UK public consistently ranks climate change and the environment in the top four concerns facing the country. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) has recognised this – it talks about the need to “empower and inform households and communities to make low carbon choices” and calls for the government to publish its long-overdue public engagement strategy. Last week’s CCC report mentions engagement or public engagement 75 times, compared with just once in the CCC’s 2018 progress report. Delivering on our net zero ambitions will mean changes in all of our lives and our communities, and it is vital that people feel involved in these changes – or we will not succeed.

In the year to May 2023 alone, Wagner reportedly received more than 86bn roubles from the state budget, or over a billion dollars. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that a “serious threat” remains at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that Russia is “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information and called for greater international attention to the situation at the facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. Air defence systems were engaged early on Sunday in repelling a Russian air attack on Kyiv, Ukraine’s air force said. Witnesses heard blasts resembling the sound of air defence systems hitting targets, but there was no immediate information about potential damage. A 51-year-old man has been killed and two others injured by shelling in Mala Tokmachka, a village near the frontline in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhia, local officials said. The head of the local military administration, Yuriy Malashko, described the site as a “frontline community under merciless enemy fire”. US president Joe Biden will host Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson next week to talk about transatlantic security cooperation and the war in Ukraine, the White House said. The two leaders “will review our growing security cooperation and reaffirm their view that Sweden should join Nato as soon as possible”. Austria, a neutral country, announced its intention to join the European Sky Shield initiative, launched in 2022 by Germany against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said the decision did not call into question the neutrality of the country but cited “a threat that has considerably worsened”. “We must and will take precautions to protect our country against the risk of drone or missile attacks,” he said. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez pledged the EU’s “unequivocal” support for Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on the first day of Spain assuming presidency of the bloc. Sanchez said his visit “demonstrates a clear and unequivocal political commitment” to Ukraine’s bid to join the EU. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy has expressed frustration over the slow deliveries of weapons and lack of clarity over pilot training by “some” western nations. “There is no schedule of training missions. I believe that some partners are dragging their feet. Why are they doing it? I don’t know,” Zelenskiy said. Two children have been injured in the Russian shelling of a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. A nine-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were injured and are receiving medical treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/sep/06/eu-unveils-package-laws-curb-power-big-tech-giants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-06T12:00:40Z","webTitle":"EU unveils ‘revolutionary’ laws to curb big tech firms’ power ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/eu-unveils-package-laws-curb-power-big-tech-giants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/sep/06/eu-unveils-package-laws-curb-power-big-tech-giants","fields":{"bodyText":"The EU has unveiled a set of “revolutionary” laws to curb the power of six big tech companies, including allowing consumers to decide what apps they want on their phone and to delete pre-loaded software such as Google or Apple’s maps apps. The package of laws will also pave the way for more competition in some of the areas most closely guarded by the tech firms, including Apple Wallet and Google Pay. The Digital Markets Act (DMA), the second big package of EU laws to hit tech firms in two months, defines a series of obligations that gatekeepers need to comply with, including not engaging in anti-competitive practices. The act follows the Digital Services Act, which came into force on 25 August and aims to curb online hate, child sexual abuse and disinformation with the first laws ever governing online content. The DMA aims to undo the gatekeeper or controlling position that large tech companies have commanded in the last 10 years and gives the European Commission the power to conduct market investigations and design remedies if the firms fall out of line. “This is revolutionary,” said one commission official. Brussels intends the laws to open the door to more competition, allowing startups to compete with the giants on a level playing field for the first time. The tech companies – including Apple, Google and Amazon – have six months to comply with a full list of dos and don’ts under the new laws, after which they could be fined up to 10% of their turnover. In Meta’s case, this would be 10% of $120bn (£95bn). One official said it would liberate the consumer and businesses, particularly startups that have faced technical barriers to accessing platforms and reaching users. “For example, now when a consumer sees an app doesn’t do well on their phone, they think immediately it is the app that is not really good. Very often it is not because the challenger app is bad, but because the interoperability is missing because it is in the interest of the gatekeeper to make sure the experience is not the same.” Phones often come preset with weather, maps, calculator and email apps, some of which are difficult to delete. This will no longer be allowed. Big tech companies will be barred from monetising information about phone users, prohibiting them from using the data they collect from apps on a phone to build up a detailed picture of individual consumer behaviours for advertisers. Officials also gave examples of the controls around payment systems on Apple and Android phones. While consumers can use alternatives such as bank cards, there may be startups that can offer truly innovative services that are currently unviable because of alleged “gatekeeping” activity. The laws will initially apply to six companies: Alphabet (which owns Google), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (the owner of TikTok), Meta (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) and Microsoft. Many of the services they offer have also been designated for regulation. These include WhatsApp, Messenger, TikTok, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Chrome, Safari, Google Maps, Google Pay and Google Shopping. Earlier this summer, Samsung was notified that it met the criteria to be classified as a gatekeeper, but the multinational successfully argued against this. The criteria include size of turnover and having at least 45 million users in the EU. The European Commission accepted arguments from Alphabet and Microsoft that their email services Gmail and Outlook did not meet the required criteria. The European commissioner Thierry Breton, who is responsible for the new digital services, described the new legislation as D-day for the large players, warning that they will now “have to play by our rules – European rules”. He described the DMA as an “important milestone” that would put consumers and concerned parents back in the driving seat, guarding against abuse and endless hours of content aimed at children on the likes of TikTok. “When something happened [in the past], you felt alone. Now we are giving the power to the public and to the users to be able to be listened to. [Now] when something happens, the obligation will be on the platforms to answer immediately and not to escape.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/sep/05/return-of-us-nuclear-weapons-to-uk-would-be-an-escalation-says-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-05T17:07:49Z","webTitle":"Return of US nuclear weapons to UK would be an escalation, says Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/05/return-of-us-nuclear-weapons-to-uk-would-be-an-escalation-says-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/sep/05/return-of-us-nuclear-weapons-to-uk-would-be-an-escalation-says-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian foreign ministry has said Moscow will view any move to return US nuclear weapons to the UK as an escalation and will respond with “countermeasures” for its own security. The foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was responding to a report last week about an item in the 2024 US air force budget for building a dormitory at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk for personnel on a “potential surety mission” – military jargon for nuclear safety and security. It raised the prospect of the return of US nuclear weapons to British soil for the first time in more than 15 years. “If this step is ever made, we will view it as escalation, as a step toward escalation that would take things to a direction that is quite opposite to addressing the pressing issue of pulling all nuclear weapons out of European countries,” Zakharova said. “In the context of the transition of the United States and Nato to an openly confrontational course of inflicting a ‘strategic defeat’ on Russia, this practice and its development force us to take compensating countermeasures designed to reliably protect the security interests of our country and its allies.” The US is estimated by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) to have 100 B61 gravity bombs deployed in Europe and another 100 B61s – the only tactical weapon in its arsenal – in storage in the US. If US nuclear weapons were sent back to Lakenheath, they would almost certainly be a modernised version of the B61. FAS estimates Russia has 1,816 tactical, or non-strategic, weapons (shorter range and intended for use in battle rather than for the destruction of whole cities). These have been held until now in storage facilities, but Vladimir Putin announced in June that some nuclear warheads would be deployed in Belarus within a month. There has so far been no confirmation by western intelligence that they have been moved. The warheads are intended for use on Belarus Iskander missile launchers or as bombs to be dropped by Belarusian Su-24 or Su-25 jets. If the transfer is carried out, it would be the first time Moscow has put nuclear weapons in the hands of allies since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Matt Korda, a senior research fellow at the FAS nuclear information project who first spotted the US budget item for a surety dormitory at Lakenheath, said: “While the potential return of US nuclear weapons to UK soil certainly merits scrutiny, it’s a bit rich to see it coming from a government who has spent the past year initiating the exact same thing with Belarus. “It’s highly unlikely that the Russian government would describe its own nuclear sharing arrangements in Belarus as escalatory or destabilising and yet the parallels between the two situations are clearly visible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/09/football-daily-west-ham-david-moyes","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-09T14:47:50Z","webTitle":"Football Daily | West Ham’s power struggle takes over the transfer window","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/09/football-daily-west-ham-david-moyes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/09/football-daily-west-ham-david-moyes","fields":{"bodyText":"MOYES WILL BE MOYES Since Tim Steidten’s appointment as West Ham technical director in early July, reports have abounded that he and David Moyes do not see eye to eye. The 44-year-old German arrived with a fine reputation for unearthing unpolished gems at Werder Bremen and then Leverkusen, with fans being told he would “be responsible for the club’s overarching player recruitment strategy and scouting department, working closely with [Moyes] and sporting director Mark Noble”. With £105m of Declan Rice money scorching a hole in the club coffers, it was important their windfall was invested wisely. In Steidten, they had found one of those hip young German football eggheads who comes armed with one of those magic witch portals young people these days refer to as “a laptop”, and is a keen student of the kind of scouting and data-driven analytics that have established Brentford and Brighton as two of the best-run teams on the planet. The kind of man whose appointment will have prompted much eye-rolling and honks of derision from Proper Football Men everywhere, not least because his 12-year playing career appears to have been restricted to 48 appearances for Seattle Sounders and SV Meppen. What does he know about the Premier League, Jeff? What does he know? Whatever it is, Steidten has found himself partnered with a man who, maybe unfairly, has garnered a reputation for being something of a meat-and-potatoes footballing dinosaur with a preference for gnarled British or Irish dogs-of-war types over the kind of untried fancy dans who ran rings around his side when they recently played Leverkusen in a pre-season friendly. Given his preference for McTominays over MacBooks, it was small wonder speculation mounted that Moyes and Steidten were at war. On Wednesday morning it became apparent who is winning that one, when news that Manchester City have set their beady eye on West Ham’s other world-class midfielder Lucas Paquetá was quickly followed by confirmation that the Tin Pot winners have agreed deals in principle to sign Harry Maguire and James Ward-Prowse for combined transfer fees of £60m, more than half their Rice “winnings”. While thrashing out personal terms for two players who are as English as sewage-drenched shorelines, real ale with bits in and apologising to somebody else when they tread on your toes, the nitty-gritty of both deals has yet to be ironed out before West Ham ramp up their efforts to sign the hot young Scottish prospect that is Scott McTominay. Given Manchester City’s interest in Paquetá and their tendency to get whoever they want with a minimum of fuss, West Ham could soon find themselves another star player down, albeit while listening to the reassuring beep-beep noise of a sky-blue bin-lorry full of cash reversing into the London Stadium to pay for more replacements. With great spending power comes great responsibility, so expect the agents of Leighton Baines, Kevin Kilbane and Steven Naismith to be expecting calls as Steidten gazes forlornly at graphs on the screen of his fancy laptop.

He will speak at the GMB’s annual conference on Tuesday, a day after he tried to calm a growing rift with its leadership over Labour’s energy policy. In a speech pledging to put workers at the heart of the party’s planned transition to green energy, the Labour leader will also seek to portray the prime minister as London-centric and overly concerned with banking. “If the City of London races ahead while the rest of Britain stagnates, as long as there was a hint of growth on his spreadsheet, Rishi Sunak would think that’s fine. But it’s not,” Starmer will tell the GMB congress in Brighton. “If you leave this many people behind, a nation cannot grow fairly. We can’t do it with low wages. We can’t do it with insecure jobs and bad work, with a stand-aside state that doesn’t fight for the future, without a proper industrial strategy.” Starmer – who is likely to be challenged on his opposition towards Labour MPs joining picket lines – will also pledge that Labour in government will work with unions, strengthening their role in society and urging businesses such as Amazon to recognise them. “We can create a new business model for Britain, one which creates economic security and grows not just our productivity, but our hope and our optimism. Labour in government will work with unions. We will always see the fight for working people as our driving purpose.” His appearance comes amid discontent among Labour’s union base over a pledge to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power. The party is proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said on Sunday that Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. In an apparent attempt to reassure union critics, Starmer stressed on Monday that “oil and gas will be part of our energy mix for many, many years to come”. Speaking during a visit to the Hinkley C nuclear power project in Somerset, he said: “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to seize the jobs of the future. Oil and gas will be part of that because, where there are existing licences, they will go on to the 2050s.” However, only a couple of hours later Smith used a speech to the Brighton conference to reiterate his criticism, urging Labour to focus on a “mix of energy sources” if it gains power, including oil and gas. He said that – while the union wanted a Labour government – he disagreed with its energy policy. “We have to fix and secure our energy supply if we are to face down threats from authoritarian regimes in the world and find a workable way to achieve net zero,” Smith said. The Unite union has also criticised Labour’s stance. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, said last week that the UK needed a properly planned transition that would “guarantee jobs, pay and conditions for all the tens of thousands of workers in the North Sea and supporting industries”. Starmer’s plans have received significant support from a range of high-profile groups, including other trade unions, environmental campaigners and even the Women’s Institute. Last year, Unite and the GMB each gave Labour about £1.2m. Starmer said on Monday that Labour talks to the GMB “all the time”. Energy policy is expected to be a key battleground for Labour in the run-up to the next election. The energy crisis, provoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has fuelled debate over Britain’s energy security and plans for green jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/10/sweden-criticised-over-plan-to-build-at-least-10-new-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T15:35:34Z","webTitle":" Sweden criticised over plan to build at least 10 new nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/10/sweden-criticised-over-plan-to-build-at-least-10-new-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/10/sweden-criticised-over-plan-to-build-at-least-10-new-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"bodyText":"Environmental experts have criticised the Swedish government’s plan to build at least 10 nuclear reactors in the next 20 years, more than doubling the current number, saying it will be too expensive and will come too late to meet energy needs. The climate minister, Romina Pourmokhtari, announced on Wednesday that in order to meet its climate goals Sweden needed to double electricity production in the next two decades. The plan for 10 new reactors would mark a dramatic change from the country’s current capacity for nuclear power, with six reactors in operation in Forsmark, Oskarshamn and Ringhals accounting for about 30% of its electricity production. Lars J Nilsson, a professor at Lund University and a member of the European climate advisory board, said he disputed the government’s claim that the new reactors were needed and dismissed the move as “symbolic”. “You cannot certainly say that we need 10 new reactors. Right now the expansion of electricity production in Sweden is through wind power,” he told the Guardian. “I don’t expect any new nuclear power in Sweden, unless the government provides quite far-reaching guarantees similar to what you have at Hinkley Point [in the UK].” The move was more about posturing than action, he said, claiming the government wanted to show it was taking action on meeting its climate goals. “I see it more as symbolic than actually creating any real change.” If the reactors were built the costs were likely to fall heavily on the Swedish taxpayer, said Nilsson. Having been a hotly debated issue in the past, this latest announcement had had a “lukewarm response”. Sweden’s reputation as a green leader on the global stage was shifting, he said. “Sweden will partly lose that profile. Now the momentum and progressiveness is coming from the EU and Brussels.” The EU’s Fit for 55 plan legally requires member states to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and become “climate neutral” by 2050. Sweden’s Moderates agreed when they formed a coalition government with the Christian Democrats, Liberals and the far-right Sweden Democrats that more reactors would be permitted and that investments in nuclear power would be made profitable through credit guarantees and changes to pricing. This week was the first time the government had given an anticipated number of new reactors. “Since day one, this government has worked with full force to remove the obstacles erected to prevent new nuclear power,” said Pourmokhtari, a Liberal, who, when she assumed the post last year, became the country’s youngest ever minister. “The climate transition requires a doubling of electricity production in the next 20 years, and nuclear power plays a decisive role for us to succeed in this.” Karin Lexén, the secretary general of Naturskyddsföreningen, Sweden’s biggest environmental organisation, accused the government of attempting to “divert focus on climate issues”. “They’re diverting focus from what is really needed currently, which is to produce enough electricity by 2030.” The plan also ignored the progress being made on new methods of storing energy and other developments, she said. “We don’t agree with the energy minister when she said in order to build more wind power we need more nuclear. We think it’s a bit old-fashioned.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/24/fukushima-fish-with-180-times-legal-limit-of-radioactive-cesium-fuels-water-release-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-24T01:16:07Z","webTitle":"Fukushima fish with 180 times legal limit of radioactive cesium fuels water release fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/24/fukushima-fish-with-180-times-legal-limit-of-radioactive-cesium-fuels-water-release-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/24/fukushima-fish-with-180-times-legal-limit-of-radioactive-cesium-fuels-water-release-fears","fields":{"bodyText":"A fish living near drainage outlets at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in May contained levels of radioactive cesium that are 180 times Japan’s safety limit. The black rockfish caught on 18 May was found by plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) to have 18,000 becquerels per kilogram of cesium-137, compared with the legal maximum level of 100 becquerels per kg. Japan’s plan to release 1.3m tonnes of treated water from the Fukushima plant has sparked concern in the region, despite approval from the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Hong Kong has threatened to ban food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures if the water release goes ahead as planned. China began blanket radioactivity testing of Japanese seafood imports this week, leading some wholesalers to cease handling such produce from Japan. Asked about concerns around the water discharge, the Tepco official reiterated that the company was confident “the impact on the public and environment will be minuscule”. Rainwater from the areas around reactors one, two and three, which melted down during the March 2011 disaster, flows into the inner breakwater where the rockfish was caught in May. Cesium concentration in the sediment from the seabed in the inner breakwater measures more than 100,000 becquerels per kg, according to Tepco. “Since contaminated water flowed into the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station port immediately after the accident, Tepco has periodically removed fish from inside the port since 2012 using fishnets that have been installed to prevent the fish from escaping the port,” a Tepco official told the Guardian. A total of 44 fish with cesium levels above 100 becquerels per kg have been found in the Fukushima plant port between May 2022 and May 2023, Tepco confirmed, with 90% of those caught in or near the inner breakwater. Other specimens identified as having particularly high radioactivity were an eel with 1,700 becquerels per kg, caught in June 2022, and rock trout, with 1,200 becquerels in April 2023. Regular monitoring of fish from the inner breakwater had been suspended after nets were installed in January 2016 to keep potentially contaminated fish inside the area. “However, when a black rockfish with radioactive concentrations that exceed regulatory standards was caught off the coast of Soma [about 50km north of the plant] in January 2022, we began sampling again within this area in conjunction with the installation of more nets to prevent fish from leaving the port,” added the Tepco official. Shipments of black rockfish caught off Fukushima prefecture were suspended in February 2022 after the radiation was detected and have yet to resume. The high radioactivity levels found in the tested specimen led authorities to believe it had escaped from the nuclear plant’s port. All species of seafood from the areas around the plant are regularly monitored for radioactivity. Next month Tepco is scheduled to begin the release of more than 1.3m tonnes of treated water from the Fukushima plant, a process that is due to take decades to complete. The operation has been approved by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, but been criticised by China and opposition parties in South Korea, and caused unease among some Pacific islands. Fumio Kishida, Japan’s prime minister, hit back at China’s decision to test Japanese seafood while on a recent tour of the Middle East. Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, Kishida said his government will “press for discussion based on scientific evidence”, regarding the release of the water from Fukushima."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/04/japan-joy-germany-dejection-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-04T13:00:14Z","webTitle":"Japan joy, Germany dejection: Women’s World Cup power rankings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/04/japan-joy-germany-dejection-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/04/japan-joy-germany-dejection-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","fields":{"bodyText":"1) Japan With three wins, 11 goals and none conceded, Futoshi Ikeda’s team have arguably been the best so far. Their 4-0 defeat of Spain in particular was eye-catching as they picked apart their opponents’ possession play. The 23-year-old Hinata Miyazawa has shone in midfield and is the tournament’s top scorer with four goals. 2) Sweden Three games, three wins, nine goals scored and one conceded. Many had omitted Sweden from discussions about serious contenders but there can be no sleeping on the side now, even though they played in a group they were expected to escape from fairly easily. Should they knock out the holders, the USA, in a tantalising last-16 clash, expectations will skyrocket. 3) England The Lionesses are “growing into the tournament” – in the words of Sarina Wiegman – after two stop-start 1-0 victories were followed by their impressive 6-1 win over China. An injury to the midfield linchpin, Keira Walsh, forced Wiegman into changes and they worked wonders, Lauren James taking the headlines with another player-of-the-match performance. 4) Netherlands A statement finish to the group stage after an unconvincing start – a 1-0 defeat of an increasingly impressive Portugal and 1-1 draw in a replay of the 2019 final against the USA. Five goalscorers in a 7-0 defeat of Vietnam, never mind the 23-place gap between the teams in the Fifa rankings, will fill the squad with confidence after the Vivianne Miedema-shaped hole up front was looking damaging. 5) Colombia Delivered one of the biggest shocks of the tournament by beating Germany, the favourites to top the group and one of the tournament favourites. With an impressive travelling crowd behind them, Colombia are having a hugely impressive campaign, with 18-year-old Linda Caicedo their poster-woman. Will be disappointed to have dropped points to Morocco. 6) Nigeria “Bring on the European champions,” said a confident Randy Waldrum after the Super Falcons came through the “Group of Death”. His side stunned Australia with their impressive 3-2 victory over the co-hosts. A fast, counterattacking team, they are a stern test for any opponent and have performed far above their world ranking of 40. 7) Australia The Matildas suffered a fright after defeat by Nigeria but a rousing performance in Melbourne in overwhelming the Olympic champions, Canada, eased worries that neither host country would progress. Far from convincing but Tony Gustavsson will feel his side have enough to see off Denmark. The health of Sam Kerr’s calf remains a worry. 8) Spain Jorge Vilda’s side cemented themselves as one of the early favourites after they swept aside Zambia and Costa Rica. Alarm bells will be ringing, however, at the manner in which they were defeated by Japan. Their propensity to be beaten on the transition will be something for their opponents to target. 9) Jamaica Against a backdrop of chronic underfunding and a crowdfunding campaign to cover the costs of travelling to the World Cup the Reggae Girls earned a stunning 0-0 draw with Brazil to knock out the 2007 runners-up. With players competing in top leagues in increasingly professional environments the gap is closing despite the lack of support. 10) South Africa Few would have rated South Africa’s chances of progressing from Group G ahead of Italy and Argentina but the 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations champions have been highly impressive. They scored one goal in their debut World Cup in 2019, losing all three games. This time they have scored six, earned four points and set up a last-16 tie with the 2019 runners-up, the Netherlands. 11) France A somewhat chaotic start to their Group F campaign finished with a 6-3 defeat of Panama. Conceding three goals to the debutants will be a big worry. Hervé Renard has not been in the job long and the team are recovering from a tumultuous period under Corinne Diacre. This tournament could be falling a little too soon for the new-look France. 12) Morocco The debutants regrouped after a 6-0 defeat by Germany to beat South Korea and Colombia and reach the last 16. A remarkable achievement, and the scenes as the news filtered through that South Korea had held Germany to a draw showed what it meant to the team with the former Lyon manager Reynald Pedros in charge. 13) USA The country’s worst World Cup start and they only narrowly got out of the group, a 0-0 draw with Portugal sparing their blushes and securing second place behind the Netherlands. Teams grow into tournaments but there appears to be a real lack of a tactical vision for a group so stacked with talent. 14) Denmark Lars Søndergaard will be pleased at his side’s progress to the knockouts after disappointment at the Euros. A late winner against China and 2-0 victory over Haiti saw them through to set up a date with the co-hosts in Stadium Australia. Pernille Harder finally got a World Cup goal in her first appearance at a finals. 15) Switzerland Inka Grings’s team may not be the most flamboyant but they did what they had to do. An opening 2-0 win over the Philippines and two goalless draws enabled them to top Group A. They are not a team to score a lot, relying on solidity. Spain’s attack will provide a sterner test of those defensive credentials. 16) Norway Drama has followed Norway and questions intensified after defeat by New Zealand. Caroline Graham Hansen’s incendiary interview after their second match, against Switzerland, set rumours swirling, as did her subsequent apology. An emphatic final game win over the Philippines, in which Sophie Haug starred, settled things. The fitness of Ada Hegerberg remains a worry. 17) Portugal So close to causing the biggest World Cup upset in history, denied a late winner against the reigning champions the USA by an upright. Portugal are rapidly developing and holding the USA to a draw, the Netherlands to a single-goal defeat and England 0-0 in their final pre-tournament friendly is hugely impressive. 18) New Zealand A topsy turvy campaign that matched recent form and ended in heartbreak. The high of the co-hosts’ tournament was their opening win over Norway in Auckland in front of a record crowd. 19) South Korea Lost to Colombia and Morocco but what a way to go out, earning a 1-1 draw with the two-times World Cup winners Germany. A staggering defensive performance. 20) Brazil A catastrophic exit, and even worse with it being the legendary Marta’s last World Cup. Brazil had previously failed to escape the group stage twice, in the first two official editions of the World Cup in 1991 and 1995. There is hope in the quality of some of their young players but the country needs to invest in women’s football to help it match expectations. 21) Republic of Ireland Showed they can now compete with the best. Katie McCabe’s Olimpico and a point against Nigeria were highlights in a tournament of firsts. The challenge is to ensure it wasn’t a one-off. 22) Canada Disastrous … how else to sum up their tournament? There will be many questions asked about the way they folded to Australia in Melbourne. A sad way for the trailblazer Christine Sinclair to say goodbye. 23) Philippines Alen Stajcic’s team were always the underdogs. Sarina Bolden’s goal in their win over New Zealand announced the Philippines at this level and will be remembered back home. 24) China Looked competitive in their opening two games but were stunned by England and struggled to adapt to the Lionesses’ tactics. It is the first time they have not progressed in World Cup history. 25) Zambia Barbra Banda made history with her penalty against Costa Rica – it was the 1,000th goal at a Women’s World Cup. A firstWorld Cup win enabled the Cooper Queens to depart on a high. 26. Panama Three defeats from three games tells one story. However, three goals against France in their final game, including a stunning free-kick to open proceedings in the second minute, brought a fitting end to a battling campaign full of promise. 27) Haiti They return home with no points but will have opened many eyes to the potential of their players. Melchie Dumornay and Kerly Théus shone against England. 28) Italy Another limp exit alongside their Euros display last year after the side excited at the World Cup in 2019. Conceding five to Sweden and the three in a defeat by South Africa will be particularly bruising. 29) Argentina A 2-2 draw with South Africa looks increasingly impressive but having earned two points in 2019 there will be disappointment that Argentina collected one point this time. A limp campaign. 30) Vietnam The debutants did so well to keep the margins against the USA and Portugal slimmer than many expected, but the floodgates opened against the Netherlands. They didn’t get a World Cup goal but there are positives to take. 31) Costa Rica They will be disappointed with their showing in their second World Cup. Struggled to hold out against all three opponents and lacked quality up front. 32) Germany Utterly disastrous. One of the favourites going into the tournament, Germany were made to pay for underestimating the tactical nous of Colombia and South Korea after a 6-0 defeat of Morocco sparked their campaign to life. The side ranked No 2 in the world are out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"stage/2023/aug/01/rock-follies-review-girl-power-pioneers-earn-their-encore","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T12:14:43Z","webTitle":"Rock Follies review – girl power pioneers earn their encore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/aug/01/rock-follies-review-girl-power-pioneers-earn-their-encore","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/aug/01/rock-follies-review-girl-power-pioneers-earn-their-encore","fields":{"bodyText":"Almost two decades before the Spice Girls gave us girl power, a fictional trio of feminist rockers were shaking up Britain’s male-dominated music scene in the TV show, Rock Follies. This production is based on that musical drama, aired between 1976 and 1977. The singers in the ironically named band, the Little Ladies (originally played with punkish camaraderie by Rula Lenska, Charlotte Cornwell and Julie Covington) are working-class Dee (Angela Marie Hurst), well-spoken Q (Zizi Strallen) and Anna (Carly Bawden) a middle-class housewife from Dorking. We are taken from their struggles on the pub circuit to discovery by hard-nosed American manager Kitty (Tamsin Carroll) and Top of the Pops fame. Directed by Dominic Cooke with a book by Chloë Moss, this is gig theatre at its most exuberant, with original songs by Howard Schuman and Roxy Music’s Andy Mackay, and no less fabulous all these years on. The three central performances each carry charisma and actors have big, strong singing voices: Strallen is magnetic and brings a touch of Absolutely Fabulous’s Patsy to her Q; Anna is a tough cookie whose spiral into addiction does not seem hackneyed. Dee here is a Black singer of exceptional talent in an era when the British music scene was overwhelmingly white, and this enriches the original story without a sense of being tacked on. There is a low-rent, pub-gig vibe to the blasts of sound and lighting, as well as the scaffold stage. Vicki Mortimer’s set comprises large instrument boxes, forever moving, as if on an invisible tour bus. Scenes are short and snappy with actors marching on and off stage but this brings energy rather than dizziness or distraction. The songs come thick and fast too, with feminist lyrics in numbers such as Stairway and Hot Neon, along with gorgeous melodic harmonies in Glenn Miller is Missing and Biba Nova. While it is wholly rooted in its time, the 1970s brand of “women’s lib” bears a similar spirit to Gen Z activism and undercuts the notion that today’s gender politics sit in opposition to old-style feminism. There is a superb period wardrobe by Kinnetia Isidore, from the unbuttoned shirt of rock star Stevie Streeter (a brilliantly bratty Tim Curry in the original, here played with sociopathic creepiness by Sebastien Torkia) to the Björn Borg-style shorts worn by Q’s boyfriend (also Torkia). Once they are selling out stadiums, they can “tell the men to take a jump”, the band agree, but until then “we have to play the game”. The production subtly dissects this idea and asks if a female-led band can ever organise itself differently in terms of power. And where male chauvinism is clearly, entertainingly, undercut, the machinery around the manufacture of a girl band is far harder to bypass, and as insidious. “This is business,” says Kitty, making all their decisions, and we wonder if the band’s feminism is simply being used as a USP. But for all their compromises, Dee, Q and Anna remain unbroken, upbeat, empowered. Girl power indeed. • Rock Follies runs at the Minerva theatre, Chichester, until 26 August"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:22:06Z","webTitle":"Russia moving nuclear warheads to Belarus, says dictator Lukashenko","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/25/wagner-group-boss-forces-leaving-bakhmut-yevgeny-prigozhin","fields":{"bodyText":"The Belarusian ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, has said that Russia has begun moving tactical nuclear warheads for storage to Belarus, adding that it was possible that the weapons had already arrived in his country. “We had to prepare storage facilities and the rest over there [in Belarus]. We’ve done all of that. This is why the relocation of nuclear munitions began,” Lukashenko said during a summit of the Eurasian Economic Forum in Moscow. Asked if the weapons had already arrived, he said: “Maybe. I will go and take a look.” The remarks came hours after Russian and Belarusian military officials signed a pact that provides for Moscow to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, marking a shift in the Kremlin’s nuclear posture that could raise the stakes of any future instability in Belarus. The plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on foreign soil is Russia’s first since 1991. The Kremlin has defended the decision saying that it is being provoked by western powers supporting Ukraine. Russia has said it will maintain control over the tactical nuclear weapons, which may be launched on Iskander-M missiles or from Su-25 planes, both of which Belarus has in its arsenal. Belarus borders three Nato countries and has missiles that could reach several capitals. The US also has about 100 such weapons stationed at bases around Europe. The transfer will further align Russia and Belarus’ militaries as Russia seeks a closer alliance with Minsk, which some have predicted will lead to Belarus’s loss of sovereignty. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the two countries would look for other ways to integrate their militaries. That decision came as Russia is bracing itself for a potential Ukrainian counterattack that could put Moscow on the defensive in its 15-month-old war. The head of the Wagner group said his Russian paramilitary organisation had begun to withdraw from the city of Bakhmut and would hand all its positions over to the regular Russian army by 1 June. Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Vladimir Putin, made the announcement during a visit to the ruined city, telling tank crews and other commanders that they would receive new orders soon and should withdraw to the rear. “We’ll hand over our positions, ammunition, everything including dry rations, to the troops,” meaning the Russian army, he said. Then, relishing another chance to ridicule the military, he said he would leave them two of his fighters in case things get “too hard”. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said on Thursday that Russia had begun to replace Wagner units with regular troops on the outskirts of Bakhmut, but that Wagner fighters remained inside the city. Russia recently claimed to have finally captured the city after nearly 250 days of fighting – a statement Kyiv disputes. Most analysts expect Ukraine to launch a counterattack, potentially threatening the Russian military’s hard-fought gains in Bakhmut and other areas of the front. Prigozhin has grown extremely critical of the Russian military, accusing Shoigu and other senior military officials of depriving his troops of shells and other ammunition. He said Wagner lost more than 20,000 men in the battle for Bakhmut. The mercenary group includes thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons. A Ukrainian official on Thursday suggested the counteroffensive would not mark a significant change shift of gear. “This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon,” wrote the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. Russian militias aligned with Ukraine also launched a cross-border raid earlier this week, setting up chaotic battles in the Belgorod region in some of the first sustained fighting on Russian territory since the beginning of the war. Ukraine has denied any connection to the fighters. A Ukrainian official on Thursday told Reuters that Kyiv had no connection to a “strange and pointless” drone attack against the Kremlin earlier this month. Video showed several unmanned aerial vehicles flying over the Kremlin walls before exploding in a flash of flight, causing damage to a building facade. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed the attack was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/jul/30/liberty-equality-embroidery-the-political-power-of-textile-art","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-30T10:00:05Z","webTitle":"Liberty, equality … embroidery: the political power of textile art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/30/liberty-equality-embroidery-the-political-power-of-textile-art","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/30/liberty-equality-embroidery-the-political-power-of-textile-art","fields":{"bodyText":"Embroidery, weaving and fabric decoration have often been dismissed as crafts rather than arts, relegated to “women’s work”. But a series of exhibitions this summer casts new light on the political power and importance of textiles in all their forms, from Brexit tea towels to dresses embellished with symbolic patterns. Palestinian embroidery is the focus of the exhibition Material Power at Kettle’s Yard, Cambridge, and its evolution from tradition to a form of political protest. Threads is a group show at Bristol’s Arnolfini that covers postcolonialism, migration and gender in its displays of weaving, knitting and stitching – including work by artists Anya Paintsil and Raisa Kabir. Textile artist Alice Kettle is co-curator of Threads. Kettle won this year’s Brookfield Properties Craft Award and also has a solo show, To Boldly Sew, in London. All three shows run until the autumn, when The Fabric of Democracy opens at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London. This delves into the history of how fabric manufacturers and designers create works of political propaganda. Then there’s the British Textile Biennial, held in Lancashire. Artists are exhibiting work inspired by “textile waste colonialism”. Victoria Udondian, Jeremy Hutchison and Sunny Dolat of Nest Collective are all addressing the western practice of dumping unwanted textiles in countries such as Ghana and Chile. Fashion historian Amber Butchart is associate curator for the biennial and curator of The Fabric of Democracy. She says: “Historically, in Europe and America, textiles were dismissed by the patriarchal art establishment as inferior to painting and sculpture, which have been prioritised in galleries. Textiles have long been viewed as ‘only’ decorative, even though feminist artists and scholars such as Judy Chicago and Louise Bourgeois have questioned this.” Butchart says that activist messages are also commonly associated with public rather than domestic spaces. She wants to show how furnishings and fashion can be political. Fabric of Democracy includes Chinese quilts – dahua beimian – decorated with symbols during the Cultural Revolution such as factory chimneys and scientific equipment. There’s also a ‘‘Got Brexit Done” tea towel, which was, briefly, official Conservative party merchandise when the UK left the EU in January 2020. “It features an image of unity even though Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU,” says Butchart. The Material Power exhibition features clothing as items of political protest and gives important space to an underrepresented group. “Palestinian women are not people that we think of as having historical record,” says the show’s curator, Rachel Dedman. “But the things they make have a fascinating and powerful connection to the political realities in which they live.” Garments on display feature motifs such as doves clutching guns in their claws and the letters PLO stitched into traditional designs. The colours of the Palestinian tricolour were used in clothes made in the early 80s, a time when it was forbidden to fly the flag. “These textiles defy what we think of as the material culture of protest,” says Dedman. “We normally think of scrawled signs and banners, but these have taken years to make with each stitch done by hand. The notion of steadfastness is central to the Palestinian resistance, and I think this embroidery embodies that.” Alice Kettle, professor of textile arts at Manchester School of Art, says she felt she could speak more powerfully through textiles and stitching than any other artistic medium. “It lets me be authentic and myself.” Kettle thinks that the pandemic ushered in a more widespread interest in making and also a better understanding of the therapeutic side of handcrafting. “People realised there’s a broader aspect to the arts, that they help us shift our focus on the world.” She also points out that our western-centric view of the arts is irrelevant to many nations. “There isn’t that definition of fine-art practice – art is about creativity and that’s normally bound up in materials.” Many British institutions are currently looking at the legacy of colonialism in their collections and featuring a wider range of creatives, especially female artists. “I think there’s a wider appreciation for telling women’s stories,” says Dedman. “This goes hand in hand with textile art.” Butchart also thinks the trend for shows about materials and protest are a sign that our view of culture is changing. “Textiles and clothing are deeply woven into the cultural heritage of humanity. Adorning the body has always been a means of communication. I think it’s great that museums and galleries are catching up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/sep/05/soft-power-in-the-bush-are-independents-the-new-rural-influencers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-05T15:00:32Z","webTitle":"Soft power in the bush: are independents the new rural influencers? | Gabrielle Chan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/05/soft-power-in-the-bush-are-independents-the-new-rural-influencers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/sep/05/soft-power-in-the-bush-are-independents-the-new-rural-influencers","fields":{"bodyText":"When you move to a country town, it takes a while to learn where the power lies. There are obvious power structures, such as the council and its councillors or the local member and their political party. In the bush, it is usually a Liberal or a National MP. That power comes with a lick of government funding and a foot in an influential door. Then there are the cliques that wield power by dint of influence or relationships with the public office holders. These might include the hospital board, the progress association or even the footy club. These bush influencers work in sync with the obvious power figures. This is human nature. You scratch my back and I will bark, as my grandmother used to say. Those power structures are hard to crack or subvert. And when you have lived somewhere for many decades, as I have, it can be hard to see how power could be exerted any differently. But halfway through this 47th parliamentary term, I got a reminder that changes can be so subtle that it’s easy to miss them. Two weeks ago, we covered a meeting of Darling Downs farmers who are fighting against coal seam gas expansion by Arrow Energy. Those farmers came to hear speakers ranging from independent ACT senator David Pocock to environmental lawyers, agricultural scientists and ecosystem specialists. It mimicked a similar event on the Liverpool Plains earlier this year, which saw teal independents invited up from Sydney to try to garner their support against Santos’ gas exploration project. The Darling Downs meeting was organised by Suzie Holt, a former independent candidate for the federal seat of Groom. She worked with Cecil Plains farmer Liza Balmain, whose property is affected by the gas expansion. Back in 2022, Holt shocked everyone at the federal election by coming second, largely off the back of preferences, to the LNP member, Garth Hamilton, in a crowded field. Hamilton is on the right of the party but on the morning after the surprising result he wrote in a statement to the local paper: “It is important now that my party acknowledges the result and sets about restoring our credibility as the home of sensible, centre-right policy. We’ve much work to do.” Holt is a former social worker, but leans progressive in a conservative country kind of way. Since the election she has called herself a regional community advocate. She has used the increased profile of her strong result at the polls to connect people and open doors. Hence the meeting on the black soil paddocks at the Cecil Plains west of Toowoomba. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Among the invitations were politicians of all stripes. She named the politicians who had showed interest (Condamine LNP state MP Pat Weir attended). She named those who had sent apologies (Queensland agriculture minister Mark Furner and Warrego LNP state MP Ann Leahy) and those who had not responded (federal Nationals leader David Littleproud). The Cecil Plains farm neighbours Littleproud’s seat of Maranoa, the safest federal conservative seat, held on 22% even after the Labor landslide. Holt told me afterwards that she had not stopped this sort of work, since the election, though she has yet to decide whether to run again. “The fact that we did so well has enabled me to have that opportunity and those doors open,” she said. “So I was happy to use that to see if we can create change. That soft power, whatever you want to call it, that ability to open those doors for the better of our community.” Her profile is such that someone walked up to her recently and told her how disappointed they were that she had not done more since being in government. Holt had to inform the voter that she was not the local representative. The whole event made me wonder whether there might be a new movement happening that does not require one to hold office to have influence. Independent MPs in rural areas have been far less numerous than the teal city independents who crowded into the crossbench after the 2022 election. That is despite the origins of the “Voices For” model as the lead-up to Cathy McGowan’s 2013 election to the Victorian federal rural seat of Indi, where the baton has since passed to fellow independent Helen Haines. A rural independent candidate who came close to toppling a Nationals-endorsed candidate was Rob Priestly in the seat of Nicholls, which borders Indi and is centred around the northern Victorian town of Shepparton. He said after his tilt at federal politics he has discovered a freedom to create change in a way that is harder for a public figure. His efforts have so far focused on water reform and the Indigenous voice to parliament, among other things. “I am not accountable to everyone, I can just go out and do what’s right – which is really about your own core beliefs for your community,” Priestly said. But while parliament and local government may not come with ultimate freedom it does come with clear lines of power. On that score, Priestly has made it clear he is not running at the next federal election. Holt, at this stage, is not prepared to say. But they are interesting case studies on the rural political landscape, in this lull between the tumult and shouting of election times. And, as they show, losing the battle may not always mean losing the influence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jun/21/the-perfect-power-nap-to-keep-you-alert","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-21T15:19:16Z","webTitle":"The perfect power nap to keep you alert | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/21/the-perfect-power-nap-to-keep-you-alert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/21/the-perfect-power-nap-to-keep-you-alert","fields":{"bodyText":"As a longstanding fan of a daily nap, I’m delighted to see that it gets the thumbs-up (Short daytime naps may keep brain healthy as it ages, study says, 20 June).

They didn’t choose to go the Rico route, and I think properly so. “Rico was meant to cover mafia cases, it was meant to cover international drug organisations.” The Georgia charge, Buck said, was “really a nuclear bomb where a bullet would have been appropriate, and I think the the scope of this charge is really something that should have been done at the federal level, if it was going to be done at all.” The district attorney of Fulton county, Fani Willis, obtained the 98-page indictment on Monday. Trump faces 13 counts over his attempt to reverse his defeat by Joe Biden in Georgia in 2020. Charges against allies including Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Sidney Powell make it the widest-ranging such indictment yet filed. Trump claims political persecution, as he does in all cases against him, a roster now running to 91 criminal charges (also covering hush-money payments and retention of classified information), a defamation case centered on a rape claim and cases involving his business affairs. Despite such unprecedented legal jeopardy, Trump dominates Republican polling, leading by around 40 points, seeming set to face Biden again next year even while a succession of trials are held. If elected, Trump could not pardon himself in Georgia or in the case over payments to a porn star, which was filed in New York. Republicans in Congress and in the presidential race have mostly stayed firmly behind Trump. Buck is a conservative known to be more independent than many. He told MSNBC: “I think there’s a lot to be concerned about. Any time a grand jury brings charges, you’ve got to be very concerned. “I think that some of these cases are more likely to be successful. I think the case involving the classified documents is a case that has fairly straightforward elements to it. And if in fact the facts that are alleged are true, that’s a very difficult case to defend.” Echoing defenses floated by Trump’s lawyers – and rejected by experts – Buck added: “I think these other cases involve speech and really the president’s mental state, and to say that he knew he had lost the election is going to be very difficult to prove. “There were people around him who said that he lost. There are people around him who said that he didn’t lose, that the election was stolen. And I think to show his mental state in both the federal election case as well as this election case, is going to be very difficult.” Buck said his constituents were split, many believing Trump was “being treated unfairly”. In Congress, he said, it was “difficult” being a Republican when “the news is constantly about Donald Trump and these indictments and his actions during a time of the election and until and after 6 January 2021”, the day Trump incited the deadly Capitol riot. “And so I think that it is difficult to break through that noise right now and try to get a positive message.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T20:43:02Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: cooling pond at Zaporizhzhia plant at risk after dam collapse – report ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","fields":{"bodyText":"The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant’s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse of the dyke around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst-case scenario and that there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but they warned of the dangers of sabotage by Russian forces who are occupying the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro River and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds that are used to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel at the site and the much bigger cooling pool used as a water reserve. “We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 [metres], after which there will not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station,” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine’s hydro power corporation, said on Thursday. In the wake of the dam disaster, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that “it is vital that this cooling pond remains intact”. “Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity,” he said. He later added that water from the Kakhovka reservoir was still being pumped to the power plant to cool reactors and other areas, though levels are at values earlier thought to make it impossible. The plant can also rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months’ worth of water, Grossi said. The IRSN report suggests that the integrity of the dyke around the pond could be in danger of collapse even without Russian sabotage. “A drop in the Dnipro’s water level could lead to basin leakage, or even to the collapse of the surrounding dyke, due to the pressure exerted by the water contained in the basin,” it said. It added that Energoatom had conducted stress tests after the Fukushima nuclear disaster following a tsunami in 2011. Those tests, it said, estimated that the dike can “withstand a Dnipro level of 10 metres in the vicinity of the power plant”. “This water level and the watertightness of the retention basin will be closely monitored over the coming days,” the report said. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou told the Guardian. Asked about the IRSN report, an Energoatom official said: “If the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir drops to less than 10 metres, the dam on the cooling pond may collapse, but not completely. Only the upper part may collapse. “But even then, the amount of water that will remain will be enough to keep the plant in a cold mode.” The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said on Thursday that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough “to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation”, but warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. “The very fact that the Russians blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station demonstrates that the Russians have no qualms about creating man-made disasters on earth,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukrainian television. “They can do the same on the territory of Zaporizhzhya NPP [nuclear power plant]. The consequences will be very bad.” “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. “We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant’s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.” Edwin Lyman, a physicist and director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “Anything that challenges the integrity of the cooling pond would cause complications and require alternate means of getting water to the spray ponds, as the paper points out. “My main concern at the moment is the increasing fragility of the site and the uncertainty regarding the ability of the reduced and stressed personnel to cope with a long-term emergency situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jun/28/regenerating-hope-the-power-of-a-good-narrative","type":"article","sectionId":"who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world","sectionName":"Who Gives A Crap: Uncrap the world","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-28T03:12:09Z","webTitle":"Regenerating hope: the power of a good narrative","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jun/28/regenerating-hope-the-power-of-a-good-narrative","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/who-gives-a-crap-uncrap-the-world/2023/jun/28/regenerating-hope-the-power-of-a-good-narrative","fields":{"bodyText":"In this episode of Changing the Bog Standard, host Dan Ilic chats to filmmaker and activist Damon Gameau about the power of a good narrative, and the importance of creating a new one Featuring: Dan Ilic – host and investigative humorist Damon Gameau – filmmaker and activist Damon Gameau understands the power of stories. The documentarian is perhaps best known for his 2014 work, That Sugar Film, which tackled hidden sugars and healthy eating myths, and his 2019 film, 2040, which looked how climate change might impact the world over the next two decades. Gameau’s most recent work, Regenerating Australia, released last year, centred around a series of interviews with a diverse group of Australians who shared their hopes and dreams for the country’s future. The idea, Gameau says, was to show viewers a vision of regeneration and a pathway to help bring it to life. But to build a new narrative, we have to change the old one. “The major narrative that’s doing all that the damage is this idea that we are separate and superior to nature,” Gameau says. Fortunately, this way of seeing nature is a relatively new thing in human evolution and it’s not too late to change it, Gameau says. We need to appreciate the “intense complexity” of a tree: all the life it provides for animals and insects, its ability to store carbon and to transpire moisture that cools the earth, as well as the nutrients it carries underground through mycelium networks. This is more than just a nice story. This reframing is essential for biosecurity and even national security, Gameau says. We need to consider the things that we rely on trees for, such as medicine, and how deforestation could affect disease treatment, or how food shortages would worsen refugee crises. “If we don’t have forests, we don’t have pollinators and we don’t get those foods. So everything is deeply connected.” If there’s one thing he learned from making Regenerating Australia, Gameau says, it’s “how incredibly lucky we are in this country and how spectacular [our ecosystems] are … and how crazy it is that we’re not looking after them”. Mangroves, for example, can store up to four times the carbon that a land forest can, as well as providing habitat for thousands of species, yet we’ve destroyed an estimated 20-35% of them worldwide over the past 50 years or so. Still, Gameau maintains hope, and his latest project is a manifestation of that. He is currently working on a film with eight young environmental activists between the ages of 10 and 12 from all over the world. The idea is to ask them which CEOs they would like to talk to, and then tour around Europe on a yellow school bus run on biofuel to meet those CEOs. “They are just so switched on and so eloquent,” Gameau says. “It really does get down to simple things … ‘Why aren’t you going and cleaning up your mess from the oceans? Why are you leaving up to us?’ “We’ve created all this complexity to distract and make excuses, but there’s something refreshing about having these children just cut through and actually not listen to any of the bullshit.”"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/18/gigantic-power-of-meat-industry-blocking-green-alternatives-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T15:00:54Z","webTitle":"‘Gigantic’ power of meat industry blocking green alternatives, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/18/gigantic-power-of-meat-industry-blocking-green-alternatives-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/18/gigantic-power-of-meat-industry-blocking-green-alternatives-study-finds","fields":{"bodyText":"The “gigantic” power of the meat and dairy industries in the EU and US is blocking the development of the greener alternatives needed to tackle the climate crisis, a study has found. The analysis of lobbying, subsidies and regulations showed that livestock farmers in the EU received 1,200 times more public funding than plant-based meat or cultivated meat groups. In the US, the animal farmers got 800 times more public funding. The money spent on lobbying the US government by meat producers was 190 times more than for the alternatives and was three times higher in the EU. The researchers also found that almost all dietary guidelines avoided highlighting the environmental impact of meat production and bans on alternative products using terms such as “milk”. Cutting meat consumption in rich nations is vital to tackling the climate crisis. Livestock production causes 15% of all global greenhouse emissions. Cutting meat and dairy consumption also slashes pollution, land and water use, and the destruction of forests, with scientists saying it is the single biggest way for people to reduce their impact on the planet. “The power of the animal farming sector, both in the US and in Europe, and the political influence they have is just gigantic,” said Prof Eric Lambin, who conducted the study with Dr Simona Vallone, both at Stanford University, US. The researchers concluded that “powerful vested interests exerted their political influence to maintain the system unchanged and to obstruct competition created by technological innovations”. Lambin said: “We found that the amazing obstacles to the upscaling of the alternative technologies relates to public policies that still massively fund the incumbent system, when we know it’s really part of the problem in terms of climate change, biodiversity loss and some health issues.” The researchers said that tackling the problem would require government policies that ensured the price of meat reflected its environmental costs, potentially via taxation, increased research on alternatives, and better informed consumers. Alex Holst, at the Good Food Institute Europe, said: “While European investment in sustainable proteins has increased in recent years, this study shows the sector is still only picking the crumbs off the EU’s table. The sector needs public investment to scale production and reduce prices [or] Europe risks missing out on the enormous benefits.” The North American Meat Institute and Copa-Cogeca, Europe’s largest farming trade body, did not respond to requests for comment. The study, published in the journal One Earth, analysed the major EU and US agricultural policies from 2014 to 2020. It found the amount of public money spent on plant-based alternatives was just $42m (£33m) – 0.1% of the £35bn spent on meat and dairy. The former accounted for 1.5% of all sales. In the EU, cattle farmers got at least 50% of their income from direct subsidies. For research and innovation spending, 97% went to animal farmers, with almost all of these funds aimed at improving production. The researchers also highlighted restrictive labelling rules. Terms such as “milk” and “cheese” have been banned since 2017 in the EU for most alternative milk and dairy products. A US proposal would prohibit the sale of alternative meats unless the product label included the word “imitation”. National dietary guidelines influence the many millions of meals served in public sector institutions such as schools, hospitals and prisons. The researchers found there was no mention of the environmental impacts of meat and dairy in US dietary guidelines nor in all but four of the EU’s 27 member states. “Dietary guidelines are shaped with a strong influence from industry representatives,” said Lambin. “However, the Nordic country guidelines have just been rewritten and for the first time clearly promote a mostly plant-based diet.” Lambin said there were glimmers of hope for a shift to more sustainable diets, with EU proposals to accelerate the shift due to be adopted this year, funding in the US Inflation Reduction Act to help farmers cut emissions, and the US approval of lab-grown chicken. “It’s not a level playing field at all at the moment,” Lambin said. “The new sector needs to be given its chance to expand and gain efficiency. After that, consumers will judge whether they like it or not, and scientists will judge whether it is really better for the environment and for health. But if it cannot even develop to a scale where we can make this assessment, it will be a lost opportunity to transition to a sustainable food system.” A 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group said plant-based meat was by far the most effective climate investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T17:34:33Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 438 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the Wagner group has said he has been promised as much ammunition and weaponry as he needs to continue his assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin made the comment in a recorded message posted on his Telegram channel on Sunday morning. Six members of Ukraine’s State Emergency Service have been killed by shelling in the southern region of Kherson, officials have said. According to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the Russian military dropped the shells from a drone near a populated area on Saturday. Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on the nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with life in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. The Russian nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Air raid alerts sounded for several hours overnight into early Sunday over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine. Officials said air defence systems shot down a number of drones, including one over Kyiv’s airspace. Five people were injured in a strike on the city of Balaklia, local authorities said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Russia has claimed that its defence systems shot down 22 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea overnight on Saturday. Writing on Telegram, the ministry of defence said that “during the night, 22 Ukrainian strike unmanned aerial vehicles were detected over the Black Sea by means of air defence.” Ukraine launched more than 10 drones on the Crimean peninsula overnight, including three on the port of Sevastopol, a Russian-installed official said early on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the situation in the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was becoming “increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous”. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman was killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. A gas pipeline and power lines in the Russian border region of Belgorod were damaged in overnight shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, according to the local governor.

Dutton told the Minerals Council on Wednesday that Australia needs a “frank debate” about nuclear energy, suggesting that it has a “wonderful opportunity to add value” to its uranium resources. The comments sparked a demand from the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in question time for the Liberals to nominate “where the plants are going to be”. On Wednesday Dutton confirmed that he appointed Ted O’Brien as shadow energy minister in part because a committee inquiry he chaired in 2019 recommended the partial lifting of the moratorium on nuclear energy to allow for “new and emerging nuclear technologies”. The Coalition is still reviewing its energy policy to develop an emissions reduction target before the next election and study nuclear energy to develop a “proper base of information”, according to comments Dutton made in the party room in August. On Wednesday the Liberal leader said “the imperative on all of us to create affordable and reliable and, where possible, emissions-reduced energy necessitates that we at least have a conversation about nuclear”. “[About] how that technology can play into the energy mix in the future? I think especially since Australia is home to one third of the world’s deposits of uranium. We have a wonderful opportunity to add value to that resource.” Dutton noted that former Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke “was strongly in favour of nuclear energy and couldn’t get it through the left of his party”. “John Howard to this day is very strongly in favour of nuclear energy as an option ... that crazy rightwinger in Canada, Justin Trudeau, is embracing small modular reactors.” Dutton posed the question: “If you don’t like coal and you don’t like gas, unless you believe clean hydrogen is about to be a reality, then what else firms up renewables? And I don’t know the answer to that question beyond nuclear.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dutton suggested nuclear energy could also help Australia “power up irrigation and open up thousands of square kilometres of export opportunities” before concluding the government should “at least allow” the community to have a debate about it. In August the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said “it is by far the most expensive form of energy”. “I mean, this is economic illiteracy from an opposition searching for relevance,” he told ABC News Breakfast. “[Nuclear] is slow to deploy. It couldn’t be deployed in Australia until 2030. “The CSIRO has made it very, very clear renewables are the cheapest form of energy. Nuclear is the most expensive. Why with rising energy prices you would put in the most expensive form of energy available is beyond me.” Later on Wednesday, the Liberals pursued Albanese in question time over his pre-election claims that Labor’s energy policy, including more renewables and upgrading the grid, could help save households $275 on their power bill. Albanese replied that the government stands by the modelling supporting the claim, and that Labor’s policy was based on the systems plan of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which identified it would “promote investment in renewables which is the cheapest form of energy”. Albanese said after “22 failed plans” the Coalition now wants “to go towards nuclear energy”. “And they can say, if you like, where the plants are going to be. I’ll look forward to their review, letting us know … [because] we know they have to be near urban areas and water.” While Labor raised the spectre of campaigning on the location of putative nuclear power plants, Dutton accused the government of asking Australians to sign up to an Indigenous voice to parliament “sight unseen”. “We have no idea what it means for the mining sector,” Dutton told the Minerals Council earlier. “We don’t know whether a voice that doesn’t represent the elders that you negotiate with or that your agreement is with in a particular location, now, they might be usurped and [the voice will] exercise a veto, right? That would damage your employees, that would damage your business.” Earlier, Dutton said it was an “inconvenient truth” for climate activists that “decarbonisation will require more mining”, due to critical minerals’ importance in renewable energy, batteries and electric vehicles. “I take some delight knowing it must keep them up at night.” Dutton said the Liberals don’t support “locking in” the 43% emissions reduction target in legislation because the “inflexible position” might disadvantage Australia if competitors did not meet their targets and it would make it “harder if not impossible” for government agencies to fund resources projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/02/uk-to-breach-iran-nuclear-deal-with-refusal-to-lift-sanctions","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-02T08:34:34Z","webTitle":"UK to breach Iran nuclear deal with refusal to lift sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/02/uk-to-breach-iran-nuclear-deal-with-refusal-to-lift-sanctions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/02/uk-to-breach-iran-nuclear-deal-with-refusal-to-lift-sanctions","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK and other European powers are expected to announce plans to breach the 2015 Iran nuclear deal for the first time when they confirm they are not going to lift sanctions on Tehran’s use of missiles this October as required in the agreement. Donald Trump took the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018, but Germany, France and the UK remained inside the deal, even though Iran responded to the US walkout by breaching the agreed limits on the quality and quantity of enriched uranium. Iran is closer to producing weapons-grade uranium than ever before. The decision by European powers to also breach the deal represents a risk since it is not clear how Tehran will react at a time it is already close to being able to manufacture weapons-grade enriched uranium. The justification cited by EU and British diplomats included Iran’s own breach of the accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran’s sale of drones to Russia for use in its invasion of Ukraine, and the possible future transfers to Russia of Iran’s ballistic missiles. The head of the UN’s nuclear weapons inspectorate, Rafael Grossi, admitted last week that an agreement on monitoring the Iranian nuclear programme had become very limited and fragmented. Iranian MPs have been objecting to the planned installation of about 10 security cameras in the centrifuge production workshop at a site in Isfahan. The 2015 nuclear deal included a series of dates or so-called sunset clauses by which certain sanctions on entities are due to be lifted by the west, but it had not been envisaged back in 2015 that the agreement would be so widely breached. The deal capped enrichment at 3.67% but Iran has been enriching at 60%. The EU sanctions are due to expire on 18 October under a UN resolution that enshrined the 2015 nuclear deal. The sanctions “called upon” Iran not to do anything to develop ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear weapons. They also barred anyone from buying, selling or transferring drones and their components capable of flying more than 300km (186 miles) to or from Iran without prior authorisation from the UN security council, permission that has not been granted. The future of the agreement is in flux after talks in Oman between the US and Iran that focused on Iran agreeing not to enrich uranium beyond 60% in return for the west releasing billions in frozen funds, as well as some US prisoners held in Tehran. The US state department has said no deal is imminent, but the negotiation has been clouded by the US special envoy Rob Malley being suspended without pay by the state department over the possible mishandling of confidential information. Malley has had his diplomatic security withdrawn pending an inquiry. The planned limited agreement is threatening to become a major issue in the US, with leading Republicans denouncing the idea of a further agreement with Iran. Mike Pompeo, the former US secretary of state, speaking to a National Council of Resistance of Iran conference in Paris likened the Biden administration to a zombie for wanting to strike another deal with Iran. “Any such deal, formal or informal, would be a calamity for the Iranian people,” he said, adding: “The despots in Tehran would ensure sanctions relief would not go to the Iranian people, but to making more drones for Russia to use against the people of Ukraine.” John Bolton, a former US national security adviser under Trump, said: “The way to change the picture inside Iran is not to engage in further assistance to the regime and to give them another lifeline, but to cut their lifelines off and let the people’s voice be heard. The nuclear deal was a bad deal when it was made and it is never going to get better.” The former UK prime minister Liz Truss said it was absolutely vital Iran did not acquire a nuclear weapon. She accused Tehran of “kicking the can down the road” and claimed “they are interested in some kind of settlement when meanwhile they have been developing those nuclear weapons. We cannot allow them to play for time. We must be tougher.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/13/sweden-joy-england-make-move-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-13T17:00:52Z","webTitle":"Sweden joy, England make move: Women’s World Cup power rankings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/13/sweden-joy-england-make-move-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/13/sweden-joy-england-make-move-womens-world-cup-power-rankings","fields":{"bodyText":"1) Sweden (up 6) An energetic first-half performance stunned the in-form Japan to see Sweden through to their second successive World Cup semi-final.

The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement on the Telegram social media platform saying the situation at the plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, was “under control”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said in a statement: “our current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.” But there are long-term concerns, both over safety and the possibility of the plant becoming operational again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C so it would be easier to restart if conditions allowed, and to supply winter heating to the neighbouring town of Energodar. Oleksiy, who left after Russian forces occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should be shut down and that the plant had sufficient resources to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was at 16.6 metres (54.5ft), “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] where water can be maintained above the reservoir level, and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is a senior research associate on the project on managing the atom at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down-staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. In his statement, Grossi said that the cooling pond should last “for some months” but it was imperative it was not damaged in fighting. The water is used to cool not just the reactor cores, but also the spent fuel and the diesel generators used for safety systems. “Absence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,” he warned. Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T17:00:13Z","webTitle":"Time for the government to tell the truth about nuclear power | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/21/time-for-the-government-to-tell-the-truth-about-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK is sadly becoming habituated to an officially sponsored attrition of truth about nuclear power.

Yet firehosing scarce public resources at ailing nuclear initiatives proceeds unabated. The nuclear fuel fund announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Tuesday is yet another among uncounted nozzles pointed variously at research, liability, insurance, training, finance, regulation, planning, non-proliferation, security, waste management, grid codes, etc. One notable feature of this most recent example of a worsening syndrome is that in the opening lines introducing this initiative, the BEIS says: “Nuclear is the only form of reliable, low-carbon generation which has been deployed at scale to date.” Whatever side is taken amid the complexities, the manifest falsity of this starkly unqualified statement is extraordinary. As the government’s own data also shows, the costs of managing variable supply are rapidly diminishing and are already far smaller than the competitiveness gap between nuclear and renewables. Current renewable contributions to UK electricity far surpass the peak achieved by nuclear. When did it become acceptable in British public life that a supposedly democratic government should so seriously misrepresent reality in a formal policy document? In a period when stakes are unprecedentedly high for climate, economy, energy security and hard-pressed households, it is time to renew reasoned scientific and democratic debate in this field and prevent this national self-harm by unaccountable special interests.

The decision by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, which had been repeatedly delayed, was finally announced on Wednesday and went against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate. French energy company EDF wants to build the 3.2 GW, two-reactor plant next to its existing site at Sizewell B, which began operating in 1995. However, the proposals have faced fierce opposition from local campaigners, who have argued against the project because of the environmental impact and the cost to energy billpayers. Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision. Planning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes. The approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents. The Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plant’s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. However, it is understood the UK government is keen to ease CGN out amid concerns over Chinese involvement with sensitive assets. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. Boris Johnson’s government put £100m of funding behind the project in January to support its development. Carly Vince, the project’s chief planning officer, said: “Sizewell C will be good for the region, creating thousands of opportunities for local people and businesses. It will boost local biodiversity and leave a legacy Suffolk can be proud of.” Julia Pyke, the director of financing for Sizewell C, said: “Energy costs will be lower with nuclear in the mix, so today’s decision is good news for billpayers. The tried and tested funding arrangement we are proposing means that, by paying a small amount during construction, consumers will benefit in the long-term. “Sizewell C will give a big boost to jobs and skills in nuclear supply chain companies across the country. It will strengthen the UK’s energy security and play a key role in our fight against climate change.” Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “The wrong decision has been made but it’s not the end of our campaign to Stop Sizewell C. Not only will we be looking closely at appealing this decision, we’ll continue to challenge every aspect of Sizewell C, because – whether it is the impact on consumers, the massive costs and delays, the outstanding technical questions or the environmental impacts – it remains a very bad risk.” Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “The construction of the proposed development will be damaging and it has been granted with insufficient consideration for the effects on nature as described by the government’s own experts. This is a ludicrous decision for an interim government to make.” Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, called the project a “red herring energy solution” as the UK attempts to move towards a low-carbon energy system. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the decision “significantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear capacity in Britain”. Hinkley Point C in Somerset, also backed by EDF, has been beset by delays and cost over-runs. The French government said on Tuesday it was prepared to pay €10bn (£8.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF amid concerns over its finances. Ministers in France want to keep a handle on soaring energy bills. Johnson has set a target of making investment decisions on eight new nuclear projects by the end of the decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/06/revolutionary-solar-power-cell-innovations-break-key-energy-threshold","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T18:00:08Z","webTitle":"‘Revolutionary’ solar power cell innovations break key energy threshold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/06/revolutionary-solar-power-cell-innovations-break-key-energy-threshold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/06/revolutionary-solar-power-cell-innovations-break-key-energy-threshold","fields":{"bodyText":"Solar power cells have raced past the key milestone of 30% energy efficiency, after innovations by multiple research groups around the world. The feat makes this a “revolutionary” year, according to one expert, and could accelerate the rollout of solar power. Today’s solar panels use silicon-based cells but are rapidly approaching their maximum conversion of sunlight to electricity of 29%. At the same time, the installation rate of solar power needs to increase tenfold in order to tackle the climate crisis, according to scientists. The breakthrough is adding a layer of perovskite, another semiconductor, on top of the silicon layer. This captures blue light from the visible spectrum, while the silicon captures red light, boosting the total light captured overall. With more energy absorbed per cell, the cost of solar electricity is even cheaper, and deployment can proceed faster to help keep global heating under control. The perovskite-silicon “tandem” cells have been under research for about a decade, but recent technical improvements have now pushed them past the 30% milestone. Experts said that if the scaling-up of production of the tandem cells proceeds smoothly, they could be commercially available within five years, about the same time silicon-only cells reach their maximum efficiency. Two groups published the details of their efficiency breakthroughs in the journal Science on Thursday, and at least two others are known to have pushed well beyond 30%. “This year is a revolutionary year,” said Prof Stefaan De Wolf, at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. “It’s very exciting that things are moving rapidly with multiple groups.” The current efficiency record for silicon-only solar cells is 24.5% in commercial cells and 27% in the laboratory. The latter may well be as close the cells can practically get to the theoretical maximum of 29%. But one group, led by Prof Steve Albrecht at the Helmholtz Center Berlin for Materials and Energy in Germany, has now published information about how they achieved efficiencies of up to 32.5% for silicon-perovskite cells. The other group, led by Dr Xin Yu Chin at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, demonstrated an efficiency of 31.25% and said tandem cells had the “potential for both high efficiency and low manufacturing costs”. “What these two groups have shown are really milestones,” said De Wolf. His own group achieved 33.7% efficiency with a tandem cell in June, but has yet to publish the results in a journal. All the efficiency measurements were independently verified. “Overcoming the 30% threshold provides confidence that high performance, low-cost PVs can be brought to the market,” said De Wolf. Global solar power capacity reached 1.2 terawatts (TW) in 2022. “Yet to avert the catastrophic scenarios associated with global warming, the total capacity needs to increase to about 75TW by 2050,” he said. The solar industry is also part of the race to high efficiency. Chinese company LONGi, the world’s biggest producer of solar cells, announced in June they had reached 33.5% in their research. “Reducing the cost of electricity remains the perpetual theme driving the development of the photovoltaic industry,” said Li Zhenguo, the president of LONGi. “The industry is running very, very fast,” De Wolf said. “And I’m sure that multiple companies are working on this in China.” Europe and the US need to increase its research and development funding to keep up and contribute to an accelerating roll out of solar power, he said. All of the high-efficiency tandem cells above 30% efficiency are small so far, measuring 1cm by 1cm. They now need to be scaled up to the size of commercial cells, which are 15cm squares or larger. The scale-up is already under way with UK company Oxford PV announcing in May a record 28.6% efficiency for a commercial-size cell. “Solar is already one of the least expensive and cleanest forms of energy available, and our technology will make it even more affordable,” said Chris Case, chief technology officer at Oxford PV. The Oxford PV cell was made using the same production line that is already producing commercial-sized tandem cells with 27% efficiency in increasing volumes. Tandem cells may prove to be more expensive than silicon-only cells, but the cells are only a small part of the cost of producing and installing solar panels, De Wolf said. One issue that remains to be resolved is how fast the tandem cells degrade over time in real-world conditions. Today’s solar cells still have 80-90% of their capacity after 25 years and De Wolf said tandems would have to match that, but that there was only limited data on their stability to date. The key to the higher efficiencies of the tandem cells from the German and Swiss groups was tackling tiny defects on the surface of the perovskite layer. These allow some electrons liberated by solar photons to flow back into the perovskite, rather than contributing to the cell’s electrical current and therefore reducing its efficiency. The solution was to put a layer of organic molecules between the perovskite and the conducting layer through which the current flows, which compensated for the defects. Significantly, all the groups used different methods to address the problem, giving more options in the search for the best commercial design, said De Wolf. “There’s still lots of room to go further,” he said. “I believe that the practical limit is well beyond 35%.” Prof Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “Solar is already a low-cost way to generate electricity and has a wide resource base across the world. The cost reductions already achieved are the main reason solar now plays such a large role in scenarios of decarbonised energy systems. Improvements in efficiency have the potential to increase the output of solar and therefore will help to reinforce that effect.” There are other technologies, such as multi-junction cells, which can have efficiencies as high as 47%, but these are very expensive to produce and would only be suitable for niche uses such as on space satellites or when sunlight is highly concentrated on to the cells. • This article was amended on 10 July 2023. The Oxford PV cell was made using the same production line that is producing commercial-sized tandem cells, not on the same production line as conventional silicon-only cells as stated in an earlier version."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-01T08:00:27Z","webTitle":"The Days review – this nuclear disaster drama is no Chernobyl","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/01/the-days-review-this-nuclear-disaster-drama-is-no-chernobyl","fields":{"bodyText":"It feels borderline immoral to criticise The Days, a serenely measured and thorough dramatisation of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and its aftermath. The resourcefulness and courage of the men on duty at the power station at the hideous moment when calamity struck, who stayed for a week afterwards working to avoid a much worse catastrophe, deserves our deep respect. But as a drama, The Days is too respectful: its desire not to leave anything out might result in tired viewers abandoning their posts. One of the most powerful earthquakes in recorded history took place under the sea off Japan’s east coast on 11 March 2011, rupturing the mains electricity supply to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. When a subsequent tsunami flooded the station – situated only 10 metres above sea level – it nullified the site’s emergency diesel generators. Now completely without power, the plant’s reactors could no longer be cooled – only an improvised damage limitation exercise would avoid a total meltdown. Fukushima was the worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl, and The Days is the first true-life dramatisation of a nuclear accident since Chernobyl, the deservedly acclaimed miniseries aired by Sky/HBO in 2019. That show was a stunning re-creation of specific events with a thick layer of more universal drama on top, as it explored not just the culture of lying and cover-ups that riddled the failing Soviet Union, but the tendency of hierarchical institutions everywhere to stifle the morals and independent thinking of individuals working within them. The Days, unfortunately, only really has the “stunning re-creation of specific events” part. Yes, there are scenes where senior managers and politicians give bad instructions because they are afraid of political blowback, concerned with their public image or too wedded to normal protocol, but they are few in number and don’t offer any surprising insights. Instead, many lengthy sequences recall the moments in Chornobyl when men volunteered to complete essential tasks, knowing that doing so would expose them to potentially fatal levels of radiation. Once the tsunami has arrived – the awesome destructive power of the sea crashing incongruously through dry-land structures is superbly rendered, and prompts a haunting miniature disaster movie featuring men stuck in a rapidly filling basement – the plant manager, Yoshida (Koji Yakusho), has to perform a terrible plate-spinning feat. He has several reactors that require ventilation, the pumping in of water, or both. As quickly as he and his team conjure a clever scheme to avert an explosion here, the readings are hitting the red zone there. Yakusho is excellent as a man who morphs slowly from a happily pottering pen-pusher, triple-checking everything with calm dedication, to a stubbly firebrand kicking over waste bins and disregarding direct orders because he can see what needs to be done, hasn’t slept for 80 hours and no longer has time for anyone’s bullshit. He is trapped in a steadily deteriorating nightmare, but the nature of it – more or less the same thing goes wrong, over and over and over, a little bit worse each time – kills The Days as a drama. Episode two centres on valves that need opening by hand, deep in the innards of a pitch-dark, increasingly irradiated building littered with debris and mud. “Please, select the staff members who will go inside,” says Yoshida to the control room supervisor, both of them tacitly aware that what he means is, decide which of your men might die. The scene where this choice is made is starkly moving, but that impact lessens as we see variations on the same scenario: something very similar takes place in episode seven, and in virtually every instalment in between. After a while it’s hard to keep track of which characters are stoically, heroically donning hazmat suits and stepping into the darkness – some of them ought to have been ruthlessly edited out. The Days also becomes a drama by numbers: much turns on this gauge not going above 600 kilopascals, that device requiring 125 volts, these dosimeters reading 85 and 97 millisieverts when a minute ago they were below 20 and so on, rather than a well-drawn human making the decision that defines them. The script is too busy ensuring it dutifully notes all the relevant facts to create any memorable characters outside Yoshida himself – evidently the show is meant as a tribute to the man, who died of cancer two years after the disaster, and on that level it admirably succeeds. It also has the feel of paying homage to the prime minister, Naoto Kan (Fumiyo Kohinata), whom we see in the grip of table-slapping frustration at waffly answers from nervous underlings. It’s an emotion that could be directed at The Days itself: when something is this important, ditch the fine details and get to the point. The Days is on Netflix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/jul/04/wimbledon-andy-murray-centre-court","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T19:55:20Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray’s star power keeps Wimbledon money machine purring | Barney Ronay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/04/wimbledon-andy-murray-centre-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jul/04/wimbledon-andy-murray-centre-court","fields":{"bodyText":"Time, please. But not just yet. As Andy Murray’s first round hit-about against a game, likable but outmatched Ryan Peniston came to an end after two ruminative hours the Centre Court crowd rose to offer an unusually tender ovation. Not so much a celebration of Murray’s straight‑sets victory as a celebration of a generalised Murray‑ness, of Wimbledon things, of a distinct place and time, another late-stage episode in this valedictory high-summer ritual. Tennis matches usually conform to a genre. The romp, the struggle, the fistfight. This sport is basically repartee, dialogue, a five-act two‑hander. On a bleak and rain‑sodden Tuesday the dominant feeling around Centre Court was closer to grateful relief. Well, we still have this, for now. This was a Wimbledon duvet day. Stewards skirted the puddles, looking for someone to corral. Through late afternoon a blocked drain outside the media room gushed water across a near‑deserted walkway, a job, as one wag pointed out, for the gutter press. With the roof down this grand stage feels a little close and steamy and intimate, like a humid tropical shed. As Murray ranged a little clunkily through his gears there were moments of somnolence in the crowd, a sinking into the seats between the big points, to the extent it was even a little startling to see Murray clench his fist and roar and point at his box for affirmation. He played with fluency at times en route to a 6-3, 6-0, 6-1 victory, but in the main this felt like a necessary duty being discharged. At the end Murray told the on-court interviewer that he felt “fit and ready for a good run”, doing so, as ever, in the voice of a community policeman telling you that your dog has just been run over and drawing wild affectionate cheers. Roger Federer was present in the royal box, another opportunity to gush and fawn over the great smouldering darling of Centre Court. The crowd duly tore its hair and squealed in Federer’s direction as he said something vague about Murray having been “very good”. And in those moments you saw once again how much Wimbledon loves its stars, its self-mythology, its flushed summer love affairs, both out of habit and as a necessary fuel to keep that vast commercial machine thrumming along. Perhaps this was the real significance here. By the end you could almost hear the tournament organisers breathing out, the TV schedulers ticking off another date. Wimbledon needs Murray’s heritage energy, his star wattage, his ratings pull. The BBC would love him to get through the second round on Thursday, ideally with a late night shriek-athon back on Centre Court. Then back again on Saturday night for a bravura free hit at the second week. That would be enough for the treadmill. It is a fascinating twist in Murray’s own career arc, the journey from gangling awkward teen to gangling awkward 36‑year‑old great of the summer game. But the fact is right now Wimbledon needs Murray a little bit more than Murray needs Wimbledon. Not least this year, which feels already like a strangely low-battery kind of Wimbledon, lukewarm in its story arcs, its sense of sweep and pizazz. Eras come and go in tennis. Right now there is a sense that the stars are falling from the skies, of an interregnum in both women’s and men’s draws. This will reset itself. Carlos Alcaraz is a luminous talent. The women’s game has a deep well coming through. Meanwhile, Wimbledon will continue to churn out its £40m annual profits whatever the action on court looks like. This is essentially a vast hospitality city-state arranged around some well-tended patches of grass. But it is also a star factory, a waxwork museum, a place of annual celebrity pilgrimage. And Novak and Andy are pretty much the last great Easter Island heads still standing from a period of vivid champion talent. Murray walked out on court at 3.43pm to an instant ovation. Actually he doesn’t really walk any more, just kind of ambles painfully, the walk of a man constantly treading on Lego blocks. It can be awkward to watch him at times now, like witnessing some venerable engine of war being ratcheted and cranked into gear. It is easy to lose track of the pins and staples and hinges holding Murray together these days, a triumph of will, bravery and the soldering skills of various elite surgeons. Early on he looked sluggish and pained. This is not a sign of physical decline in itself. He always looks sluggish and pained. He looked sluggish and pained when he was surging towards a destiny-defining Olympic gold medal in 2012. There was a little more snap and vim, the old command of angles, as he eased through the final two sets. But then, this is his 15th Wimbledon, a journey that began when Andre Agassi and Martina Navratilova were still playing. And not for the first time – how many years has it been now? – Murray is at that point of jeopardy where every game here could be his last, such is his age and injury record. For now there will at least be one more turn; with a sense in his intensity of purpose, in the muscle memory of the backhand, the old Murray spring in some of his returns, that he isn’t quite ready to let it drop just yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/18/grant-shapps-earmarks-20bn-for-new-fleet-of-nuclear-reactors-in-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-18T16:46:05Z","webTitle":"Grant Shapps earmarks £20bn for new fleet of nuclear reactors in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/18/grant-shapps-earmarks-20bn-for-new-fleet-of-nuclear-reactors-in-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/18/grant-shapps-earmarks-20bn-for-new-fleet-of-nuclear-reactors-in-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Grant Shapps has condemned the neglect of Britain’s nuclear industry as a “colossal mistake” as he earmarked £20bn for a fleet of new reactors – but admitted it would take six years to even make a decision on giving projects the green light. The government formally launched Great British Nuclear (GBN), an independent body designed to aid the delivery of new projects, on Tuesday. In a delayed speech to industry at the Science Museum in London, Shapps noted that opposition had grown against nuclear power in the 1980s and “eventually that mood even percolated its way into government itself”. He said: “By the early 1990s, just four decades after Britain had led the world by building the first ever commercial nuclear power station at Calder Hall in Cumbria, our nuclear industry was firmly in decline. “That was a colossal mistake, consigning us to decades more reliance on fossil fuels … We are heralding the beginning of a new nuclear age, a renaissance in Britain’s nuclear industry.” Shapps was critical of governments of the past, including under Labour, and said the coalition and the pandemic had played a part in holding up Britain’s nuclear efforts. Alan Whitehead, Labour’s shadow energy minister, said: “It’s shambolic that after 13 years of Tory government, not one of the 10 nuclear sites approved by the last Labour government have been built.” Alongside the launch, officials published a tender for procurement contracts for a fleet of small modular reactors (SMR) – factory-built plants designed to produce power more quickly than larger counterparts such as Hinkley Point C. The tender states that between one and four awards could be made, and up to £20bn spent on developing designs and funding construction. However, Shapps stressed that the figure was “not a spending commitment” and a process will begin this year to select “probably between two and four technologies” to build. A number of manufacturing firms including Rolls-Royce, NuScale and Hitachi are developing competing SMR technologies. It is unlikely that any of the suggested £20bn of taxpayer funding will be distributed before the next election. A final decision on each project will not occur before 2029 – a date at which Rolls-Royce had hoped to be up and running – with power being produced from the “early 2030s”. GBN will be tasked with helping to deliver the government’s commitment to provide a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear energy by 2050, up from 15% now, and reduce Britain’s dependence on fossil fuels. However, critics of nuclear power argue that projects are repeatedly delayed, over budget and draw time and resources away from renewables such as wind and solar projects. Separately, Shapps announced £157m of grant funding to support the UK nuclear industry, on top of £700m announced last year for Sizewell C, a nuclear power plant in Suffolk. Shapps said the “developer-led” approach to building new plants “just has not delivered”, and that government was playing a more direct role to give investors more certainty. Rolls-Royce, which has already received £210m in public funds for SMRs, hailed the £20bn potential spend as a “vital step forward”, but Greenpeace has labelled the technology a “bad bet”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/27/augustin-mouchot-french-pioneer-solar-power-engine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-27T05:00:27Z","webTitle":"The French solar power pioneer who was light years ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/augustin-mouchot-french-pioneer-solar-power-engine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/27/augustin-mouchot-french-pioneer-solar-power-engine","fields":{"bodyText":"In 1861, a French maths teacher, Augustin Mouchot, was so concerned that world supplies of coal would eventually run out that he invented ways of using solar power, starting with a solar water heater for baths and a solar oven for cooking. In 1866, he invented a solar-powered steam engine, using a trough of curved shiny metal to focus the sun’s rays on to a tube filled with water, turning the water to steam, which drove an engine. Mouchot showed his largest solar engine at the World’s Fair in Paris in 1878. The sun’s rays were concentrated in a reflective metal cone focused on a boiler attached to a heat-powered refrigeration device that produced blocks of ice. It caused a sensation, with audiences watching in amazement to see ice made by solar power. Mouchot also used a solar-powered steam engine to drive a printing press and a water pump for irrigation. The exhibition in 1878 also marked the rise to prominence of the internal combustion engine, at just the time when coal and oil were becoming much cheaper, and so interest in solar energy and engines rapidly faded.

The comments follow renewed debate in recent weeks over whether the flagship project of the Aukus pact – which relies on support from the US and the UK – will lead to an erosion of Australian sovereignty. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether the submarines could be “operated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navy”, and whether that effectively meant “sovereignty would be shared with the US”. But the head of the taskforce advising the Australian government on the acquisition of at least eight submarines, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, used an interview with ABC TV on Monday evening to assert Australian control. “When we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capability,” he told the 7.30 program. “We will be commanding and controlling, under the Australian government direction, that nuclear-powered submarine.” Mead allowed for the possibility Australia would need advice from foreign engineers – but said that would not limit Australian command and control. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Yes, we may have US or UK seariders on board to assist,” he told the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. “We would expect anyone, whether it be a foreign engineer or an Australian engineer, to provide advice. Ultimately the commanding officer of that submarine – the Australian – would have command and control over the reactor, over the submarine, unequivocal.” Mead continued to argue that the nuclear reactors powering the submarines – to be supplied from overseas – would be “welded shut” and would not need refuelling during the life of the boat, so Australia would not need to manufacture nuclear fuel. But Mead said the plan would require Australia to send personnel to US “design facilities”. That would enable Australia to understand “every element of detail of that reactor”, he said. Mead did not rule out the possibility that Australia might build its own nuclear reactors in the future, although that would be a decision for government. “We are not envisioning that at the moment, we haven’t gone into that at the moment,” he said. Like the defence minister, Richard Marles, Mead expressed confidence that the plan to be announced soon would ensure there was no capability gap between the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class diesel-electric submarines and the entry into service of nuclear-powered boats. But he did not provide specifics. Mead also described the purpose of nuclear-powered submarines as being to “put the greatest question of doubt in the enemy’s mind” and “if necessary, respond with massive firepower”. Marles used a speech to parliament last week to declare that acquiring nuclear-powered submarines would “dramatically enhance” Australia’s sovereignty, rather than undermine it. Marles, who is also the deputy prime minister, said “the reality is that almost all of Australia’s high-end capability is developed in cooperation with our partners”. Marles said Australia would “always make sovereign, independent decisions on how our capabilities are employed”. In the wake of that speech, Turnbull tweeted that it was “quite a different thing to have a major platform that cannot be operated without the supervision/support of another country”. Turnbull said on Monday evening: “I think the question which has not been answered is: could the submarines be operated if US technical advice/support were withdrawn? The entire resources of the Australian news media have been unable to pin the government or the navy down on that.” Paul Keating, the former Labor prime minister has previously raised concerns about increased reliance on US support and suggested Australia’s sovereignty was being “wilfully suborned”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/25/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-plant-china-wastewater-release","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-25T08:21:12Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: China accused of hypocrisy over its own release of wastewater from nuclear plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/25/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-plant-china-wastewater-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/25/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-power-plant-china-wastewater-release","fields":{"bodyText":"As China bans all seafood from Japan after the discharge of 1m tonnes of radioactive water from the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean, Beijing has been accused of hypocrisy and of using the incident to whip up anti-Japanese sentiment. Scientists have pointed out that China’s own nuclear power plants release wastewater with higher levels of tritium than that found in Fukushima’s discharge, and that the levels are all within boundaries not considered to be harmful to human health. On Thursday, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the company that manages the plant, began pumping water containing radioactive tritium into the sea, starting a wastewater discharge process that is expected to take at least 30 years. The plan has been approved by the UN’s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Japanese government. On Friday, Tepco said rapid tests of samples taken from the first batch of released wastewater showed radioactivity levels well within safe limits. “We confirmed that the analysed value is equal to the calculated concentration and that the analysed value is below 1,500 becquerels per litre,” a Tepco spokesperson, Keisuke Matsuo, told reporters. The national safety standard is 60,000 becquerels a litre. “We will continue to conduct analysis every day over the next one month and even after that, maintain our analysis effort,” Matsuo added. “By providing swift, easy to understand explanations we hope to dispel various concerns.” China has condemned the discharge, with the customs agency saying it risks the “radioactive contamination of food safety”. China’s foreign ministry said it was an “extremely selfish and irresponsible act”. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said his government had used diplomatic channels to request that China’s ban on Japanese seafood be lifted. “We strongly encourage discussion among experts based on scientific grounds,” Kishida told reporters, according to the Kyodo news agency. China’s Fuqing power plant in Fujian province releases about three times more tritium into the Pacific than the planned Fukushima discharge. Beijing appears to be basing its distinction on Japan’s discharge having originated from a nuclear disaster. “There is a fundamental difference between the nuclear-contaminated water that came into direct contact with the melted reactor cores in the Fukushima nuclear disaster and the water released by nuclear power plants in normal operation,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said on Wednesday. “They are different in nature, come from different sources and require different levels of sophistication to handle.” Authorities in Hong Kong also claimed the situation was “completely different” when asked about its ban on Japanese seafood, saying other radioactive substances could also be present. The Kori nuclear power plant in Busan in South Korea releases a similar amount to Fuqing. South Korea has also criticised the Fukushima decision, but its government recently said it accepted the IAEA’s safety report approving the plan. Many scientists agree with the IAEA that the release will have a “negligible” radiological impact on people and the environment. Dr David Krofcheck, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland, said: “The release of currently filtered cooling water containing tritium atoms from the Fukushima plant will not cause physically detrimental effects. Tritium is produced naturally as part of our normal environmental background radiation, and it travels via rain or rivers into the world’s oceans. “The water release is designed to have seven times less tritium per litre than is recommended for drinking water by the World Health Organization. Much more tritium has been released by normally operating nuclear power plants into the north Pacific Ocean since those plants in China, South Korea, and Taiwan, were first located on coastal sites.” Greenpeace has said the radiological risks from Fukushima have not been fully assessed, and the biological impacts of tritium, carbon-14, strontium-90 and iodine-129 – to be released with the water – “have been ignored”. Tepco and Japan’s government have said the filtering process will remove strontium-90 and iodine-129, while the concentration of carbon-14 in the contaminated water is far lower than its regulatory standard for discharge. The Japan-based Citizens’ Nuclear Information Centre is among critics who have said not enough is known about the long-term effects of pumping tritium into the sea. “Tepco, the [Japanese] government, and the IAEA have all failed to properly consider and evaluate the environmental contamination caused by the long-term release of radioactive materials and the behaviour of radioactive materials in the environment,” it said in a statement. Chinese fishmongers are now fretting about empty shelves as they are unable to restock Japanese imports, which were previously considered to be of a higher quality than seafood from other countries. There has been a run on salt in some Chinese supermarkets, just as there was in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, because of baseless rumours that the iodine in salt can prevent radiation poisoning. On Thursday, the China National Salt Industry Corporation, the state-owned salt monopoly, published a statement addressing the “panic buying” of salt and reassuring consumers that its salt was not tainted by Japanese nuclear pollution. The spat has also whipped up nationalist sentiments. In one poll posted on Weibo this week, people were asked how they felt about the discharge. The three options given were: “It violates international conventions and international marine protection laws”, “It is abnormal behaviour that does not conform to common sense” and “It seriously damages the ecological environment”. In the early hours of Friday morning, six of the top 10 trending topics were about Japan and Fukushima, with one topic calling for Mount Fuji to erupt. On Weibo Chinese users have begun sharing lists of Japanese cosmetics, urging people to boycott them over radiation fears. On Thursday, China’s ministry of foreign affairs was asked why it was banning only seafood imports from Japan, given their stated scientific concerns about water contamination should also apply to the seas around Russia and South Korea. Wang did not answer, instead repeating accusations that Japan had “turned itself into a saboteur of the ecological system and polluter of the ocean”.

As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation. Central to the debate is also how Germany hopes to maintain its climate goals, particularly after a recent decision – backed by the Green economics minister – to reignite highly polluting coal-fired power plants for a limited time. The proposal gaining ever more traction and making its mark in newspaper editorials and late-night television debates is for the country’s remaining three nuclear power plants, which are due to close at the end of the year, to be kept running, a move staunchly opposed by the Green party since it came into existence in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the FDP has not publicly signalled that it is ready to give up its enduring opposition to a speed limit on the autobahns, but the opposition Christian Democrats, under pressure from their close allies, have hinted they may be prepared to consider backing a temporary limit. Germany’s last three remaining nuclear power stations generate enough electricity to heat about 7m homes, or to cover just under 6% of the country’s electricity needs. Talk of keeping them open remains speculative, but comments from both sides of the debate suggest they might move towards a compromise. The Greens’ co-leader, Ricarda Lang, said on Sunday that it was not the right time to think of prolonging the life of the plants, but she said that owing to the energy crisis and the impact it was having on lower-income families, her party had to be ready to consider all options. “At every moment in this crisis we need to react according to the current situation and to examine every measure. That’s what we’ve done in the past … and that’s what we’ll continue to do,” she said on German television. She said the Greens’ main concern was the impact of higher energy bills. “We have to prevent a wave of poverty,” she said. In response, Jens Spahn, a parliamentary deputy of the Christian Democrats, which along with the FDP has long opposed a speed limit, said: “If the Greens said they would let nuclear power run for another half a year, then I believe we should also be ready to talk about the speed limit.” He told Germany’s breakfast TV programme Morgenmagazin that at a time of national emergency, “everyone has to be prepared to jump over their own shadows”. Experts have said the flippant way in which the two issues are being discussed does not reflect the complexities behind them. The two issues are said to be to Germans the equivalent of what gun ownership is to Americans. The phase-out of nuclear power plants in Germany was triggered by the Fukishima accident in Japan in 2011, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to renewed debate. A government report concluded that prolonging their use was not advisable as it would “only make a small contribution to energy security” and would “increase costs elsewhere”. It said the challenge of refuelling them would mean they would not deliver electricity until autumn 2023, and they would have to run between three and five years longer in order to make investments in staff and infrastructure pay off. It also said security measures to protect the plants, including from air attack, meant it was not feasible to consider them as a short-term solution. And all that is before any likely legal challenges are taken into account. Introducing a speed limit on the parts of the motorway that have none would be easier, in theory. Advocates say it would increase safety and reduce emissions. A 130 km/h (80 mph) limit could decrease CO2 emissions by 1.9m tonnes a year, according to the German environment agency. Opponents argue it would not make the roads safer – most deaths occur on country roads, not motorways – and insist the freedom to speed has to be clung to as it is one of the few areas of German life which remain relatively unregulated. FDP voters are among the strongest supporters of no speed limit and keeping nuclear power, while Green voters are almost equally in favour of a speed limit and ditching nuclear power. And just as the Greens argue that a speed limit would reduce emissions, FDP members are liable to argue that keeping open the three nuclear plants would save about 30m tonnes of CO2 annually. ADAC, which represents about 21 million German drivers, has said about 50% of its members are in favour of the introduction of a limit and 45% are against."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jul/21/ai-nuclear-weapons-kai-bird-oppenheimer-author","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-21T14:36:34Z","webTitle":"Oppenheimer biographer supports US bill to bar use of AI in nuclear launches","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/21/ai-nuclear-weapons-kai-bird-oppenheimer-author","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jul/21/ai-nuclear-weapons-kai-bird-oppenheimer-author","fields":{"bodyText":"A biographer whose Pulitzer prize-winning book inspired the new movie Oppenheimer has expressed support for a US senator’s attempt to bar the use of artificial intelligence in nuclear weapons launches. “Humans must always maintain sole control over nuclear weapons,” Kai Bird, author of American Prometheus, said in a statement reported by Politico. “This technology is too dangerous to gamble with. This bill will send a powerful signal to the world that the United States will never take the reckless step of automating our nuclear command and control.” In Washington on Thursday, Bird met Ed Markey, the Democratic Massachusetts senator who is attempting to add the AI-nuclear provision to a major defense spending bill. Markey, Politico said, was a friend of Bird’s co-author, the late Tufts University professor Martin J Sherwin. A spokesperson for the senator told Politico Markey and Bird “shared their mutual concerns over the proliferation of artificial intelligence in national security and defense without guardrails, and the risks of using nuclear weapons in south Asia and elsewhere. “They also discussed ways to increase awareness of nuclear issues among the younger set.” J Robert Oppenheimer was the driving force behind US development of the atomic bomb, at the end of the second world war. Bird and Sherwin’s book is now the inspiration for Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s summer blockbuster starring Cillian Murphy in the title role. The movie opens in the US on Friday – in competition with Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s film about the popular children’s doll. On Friday, Nolan told the Guardian: “International surveillance of nuclear weapons is possible because nuclear weapons are very difficult to build. Oppenheimer spent $2bn and used thousands of people across America to build those first bombs. “It’s reassuringly difficult to make nuclear weapons and so it’s relatively easy to spot when a country is doing that. I don’t believe any of that applies to AI.” Nolan also noted “very strong parallels” between Oppenheimer and AI experts now calling for such technology to be controlled. Nolan said he had “been interested to talk to some of the leading researchers in the AI field, and hear from them that they view this as their ‘Oppenheimer moment’. And they’re clearly looking to his story for some kind of guidance … as a cautionary tale in terms of what it says about the responsibility of somebody who’s putting this technology to the world, and what their responsibilities would be in terms of unintended consequences.” Bird and Sherwin’s biography, subtitled The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer, was published in 2008. Reviewing for the Guardian, James Buchan saluted the authors’ presentation of “the cocktails and wire-taps and love affairs of Oppenheimer’s existence, his looks and conversation, the way he smoked the cigarettes and pipe that killed him, his famous pork-pie hat and splayed walk, and all the tics and affectations that his students imitated and the patriots and military men despised. “It is as if these authors had gone back to James Boswell, who said of Dr Johnson: ‘Everything relative to so great a man is worth observing.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/12/defiant-leaders-of-niger-coup-confident-of-holding-on-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-12T21:56:18Z","webTitle":"Defiant leaders of Niger coup confident of holding on to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/12/defiant-leaders-of-niger-coup-confident-of-holding-on-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/12/defiant-leaders-of-niger-coup-confident-of-holding-on-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The leaders of the military takeover in Niger remained defiant this weekend, apparently confident that disarray among regional opponents, support from other military regimes in neighbouring countries and a wave of popular mobilisation at home will allow them to keep power for the indefinite future. Mohamed Bazoum, the democratically elected president of Niger, remains confined to his official residence in Niamey, the capital, amid faltering international efforts to convince the new rulers of the unstable but strategically important country to return to barracks two weeks after launching a coup. Analysts say that Abdourahamane Tchiani, the former commander of the presidential guard who leads the new regime, and his fellow senior officers had been underestimated by observers in the region and farther afield. “Unlike other coups [recently] these are high-level officers, men in their 60s, with lots of experience and including some who are really well trained. They don’t hold all the cards, but certainly hold a lot of them,” said Corinne Dufka, a respected independent consultant and author working on the Sahel. “Everyone I speak to [in Niger] says the train has left the station and Bazoum is not coming back.” Bazoum was seen by his doctor on Saturday, his entourage said, amid mounting concern for his health. Bazoum, 63, was toppled on 26 July by his presidential guard, which has since held him and his family at his official Niamey residence. The EU, the African Union and the UN joined others in sounding the alarm for Bazoum on Friday after reports described worsening detention conditions. Bazoum “had a visit by his doctor today”, a member of his entourage told AFP on Saturday, adding the physician had also brought food for Bazoum, his wife and son. “He’s fine, given the situation,” the source added. Human Rights Watch said it had spoken to Bazoum earlier this week. The ousted leader had described the treatment of himself, his wife and their unwell 20-year-old son as “inhuman and cruel”, HRW said. “My son is sick, has a serious heart condition, and needs to see a doctor,” the group quoted him as saying. “They’ve refused to let him get medical treatment.” On Thursday, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) said a military force had been put on standby to restore democracy in Niger but gave no details of how or when an intervention might occur. A key planning meeting of West African army chiefs of staff was postponed indefinitely. An earlier deadline set shortly after the 26 July coup expired on Sunday and Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the president of Nigeria, has shifted to stressing diplomacy and negotiations to resolve the crisis. “The threat [of military intervention] was a miscalculation,” said Olayinka Ajala, an expert in west Africa and the Sahel at Leeds Beckett University. “Even the smallest military intervention could be disastrous for the region … I don’t think [Niger’s new rulers] are going to relinquish power. They have gone too far.” In Niamey, Niger’s capital, supporters of Bazoum continued to call for severe reprisals to weaken the tightening grip of the military before it is too late. Ecowas has imposed economic sanctions against Niger in an attempt to destabilise the new regime and deter such takeovers after a sudden spate of coups against democratic governments in the Sahel since 2021. Kossey Sanda, an adviser to Bazoum, said the Ecowas sanctions were proportionate to the “stupid acts” of the soldiers. “The impact of the Ecowas sanctions is very obvious. The price of almost everything has soared, banks lack liquidity so their customers can’t withdraw cash, state revenues have dropped 75% in a week,” Sanda said. But many say the suffering caused by such measures will only build support for the coup leaders. Niger’s military regime is already riding a wave of popular support rooted in deep resentment at the failures of its elected leaders in recent years. While a political elite has often prospered, sometimes through corruption, ordinary people face Islamic extremist violence, rudimentary services, sky-high unemployment and shortages of basic necessities. The suspension of electricity supplies from Nigeria has caused deep anger. Hamidou Albade, 48, said he’s been unable to run his shop on the outskirts of Niamey because there’s been no electricity. “It’s very difficult, I just sit at home doing nothing … We’re suffering now, but I know the junta will find a solution to get out of the crisis,” he said. Bassirou Baki, an independent journalist in Niamey, said the people of Niger were already being ravaged by day-to-day insecurity caused by terrorism and climate breakdown. “Any sanctions should not target them but those who took power by force … Lots of fresh food businesses are going bust, there are sick people dying in the hospitals and in the maternity wards babies are being delivered by torchlight. Some don’t survive,” he said. Though the coup leaders initially claimed that they seized power to better protect the nation from surging Islamist extremist violence, they have now shifted to a narrative focused on alleged exploitation of the country’s resources by France, the former colonial power. “This is clearly a populist narrative, and has evolved … from something internal [about security] to a more anti-French, anti-western discourse which definitely resonates and mobilises support,” said Nina Wilén, director of the Africa programme at the Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels. The new rhetoric from the military rulers of Niger may also be designed to divert attention from the real reasons for the takeover. Bazoum, elected in 2021 with a vote of 55%, moved to marginalise a series of senior officers this year and is thought to have been planning to fire Tchiani. Several have been named in graft investigations. Bazoum has not been seen in public since the coup, although sources close to him say that he has refused to resign. The president and his family are living without electricity and relying on supplies of rice and pasta, according to his daughter. So far Niger’s new military rulers have ignored international efforts to mediate and last week refused to admit mediation teams from the UN, the African Union and Ecowas. A senior US official was also turned away. Both Mali, ruled by a military regime since 2021, and Burkina Faso, where a 35-year-old army captain took charge last year, have offered loud support. Kimba Karimou, president of a youth wing of the main party opposing Bazoum in Niger, said threats of military intervention “did not scare” anyone. “Our sovereignty, our freedom is very dear … The people of Niger will confront any foreign army,” he said. Niger was seen previously as the most stable of Sahel countries and a key western ally in the region. The EU and US have spent vast sums of development and security assistance there in recent years. Much of this aid has now been suspended. Some research offers a slender hope. A mass opinion survey by the UN found support for military regimes as “superficial” and pointed to the enduring appeal of democracy across the Sahel in a recent report. “There is a stronger democracy in Niger than in other places in the region and a less abusive and more professional military. We need to listen to Nigeriens from all walks of life to come up with a concrete plan on how to midwife a speedy, inclusive transition back to civilian rule, understand why this happened, and address those root causes,” said Dufka. • This article was amended on 12 August 2023 because an earlier version said the top image was of Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani when in fact it was Mohamed Toumba.

By the close of this urgent, electric documentary, Bobi is a changed man: sober, serious, not broken exactly, but certainly bruised by the experience of squaring up against the ruthlessly authoritarian incumbent president, Yoweri Museveni. In power since 1986, Museveni is not about to voluntarily step down. To this end, in 2018 the then 73-year-old Museveni rewrites a clause in the Ugandan constitution that had hitherto barred people above 75 from running for the highest office, allowing him to stand for election yet again. In response, and with the support of his wife, Barbie, Wine steps up his opposition, graduating from cheery, toe-tapping protest songs to an official political campaign. The response from the Museveni regime is swift and brutal: Wine is arrested and severely beaten in custody. But this only serves to strengthen his resolve. Thematically, there are parallels with Navalny, the Oscar-winning portrait of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. But while that film unfolded like a controlled, meticulously paced thriller, Bobi Wine: The People’s President places the camera on the precarious frontline of a political battle that could prove to be fatal. It’s a gripping piece of film-making: a propulsive, kinetic account of a grassroots campaign captured at what would seem to be considerable personal risk to both the subject and directors.

The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunterston B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, their report said. Failures in the government’s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional £10.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UK’s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade. The government has recently agreed that once the stations have been defuelled by EDF, which involves the removal of all the spent fuel from the reactor core and cooling ponds, ownership of the stations will be transferred to the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to complete decommissioning. “The pace at which the stations can be defuelled could have a big impact on the costs, between £3.1bn and £8bn depending on the time taken,” the inquiry report said. “Successful defuelling will depend on all parties being ready and working together, including the NDA being ready to receive and dismantle the volume of fuel arriving at Sellafield. Any delays in the defuelling process could result in costs increasing substantially. “The handover agreement does not appear to sufficiently ‘incentivise cost efficiency and ensure a smooth transfer of defuelled stations to the NDA’.” The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer £132bn to decommission all the UK’s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UK’s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from £12.6bn in 2004-05 to £23.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. “There remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,” the report said. “The cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.” There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors – which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations – had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online. • This article was amended on 20 May 2022 to refer correctly to Hunterston B power station, not “Hunstanton B”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/18/nuclear-waste-dump-south-australia-sa-trial-traditional-owners-win-case-barngarla-people","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-18T05:05:05Z","webTitle":"Traditional owners win court case to stop nuclear waste dump in South Australia ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/18/nuclear-waste-dump-south-australia-sa-trial-traditional-owners-win-case-barngarla-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/18/nuclear-waste-dump-south-australia-sa-trial-traditional-owners-win-case-barngarla-people","fields":{"bodyText":"Traditional owners opposing the federal government’s plan for a nuclear waste dump on their land in South Australia have had a major win, with a court ruling the facility can’t be built. The Barngarla people were jubilant outside the federal court in Adelaide on Tuesday after justice Natalie Charlesworth said the commonwealth’s decision to build the dump near Kimba would be set aside. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Charlesworth said “apprehended bias” and “pre-judgment” by former Coalition resources minister Keith Pitt meant the court would uphold an application by the Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation (Bdac). “It’s about listening to the First Nations people,” the corporation’s chair, Jason Bilney, said after the ruling. Bilney said the fight over their traditional lands had continued for 21 years – with the waste dump just the latest instalment after battling for native title for more than two decades. Bilney said his people would have fought for another 21 years if necessary. “It’s about standing up and continuing that fight … to get us to where we are today,” he said. “The lesson is about truth-telling. You can go on about the voice, but it’s about listening to the First Nations people and here we are today and we prevailed and we won.” Pitt made a declaration in 2021 that a property called Napandee would be the site of the national radioactive waste management facility. The declaration meant the commonwealth acquired the land. The plan was for low-level nuclear medical waste currently stored in hospitals and universities across the country to be permanently stored at the site along with intermediate-level waste, which would be stored until a separate facility was built for that material. Bdac lodged an application for judicial review of the project in 2021. The court on Tuesday upheld its claim there was an “apprehension of bias” in Pitt’s decision. In her reasoning, the judge pointed to comments made by Pitt and his predecessor, Matt Canavan, that suggested Napandee had been chosen in early 2020, before Pitt declared it in November 2021. “The applicants’ case is that the minister [Pitt] made public statements that they allege might indicate that he might already have made up his mind,” Charlesworth wrote. “His statements demonstrated unswerving dedication to achieving a factual outcome for the benefit of those persons in Kimba who favoured the facility being located at Napandee, whilst at the same time displaying a dismissive attitude to its key opponent, the Barngarla people”. The judge rejected the respondent’s argument that “a finding of apprehended bias would have the consequence that ministers responsible for the administration of statutes could never participate in robust political discourse with respect to the subject matter of their statutory powers or with respect to the repeal or amendment of the law”. In June, Senate estimates heard the federal government had spent almost $14m in legal costs fighting Bdac, which Bilney labelled “disrespectful and hypocritical”. A 2019 ballot of ratepayers found most supported the facility, but it excluded traditional owners who did not live in the council area. They held a separate ballot which unanimously rejected the proposal. The Barngarla people argued if the two ballots were combined they would show a majority of affected people were against it. Dave Sweeney, the Australian Conservation Foundation’s nuclear campaigner, said the government should keep all the waste at the Lucas Heights facility in Sydney. The decision to build a new facility was “unnecessary and unpopular”. “Now it’s unlawful,” Sweeney said. “What we want now is the Albanese government, [current resources minister Madeleine] King, and if necessary the prime minister to draw a line under the failed approach of decades and to have a new approach.” Sweeney said extending interim storage at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation at Lucas Heights was “a clear and credible alternative”. King said she would review the ruling and it would be “inappropriate to make further comment” with the matter still before the court. “Labor worked with the Barngarla people in the last term of parliament to ensure they secured the right to seek judicial review of the decision to acquire the facility site,” she said. “The principle of judicial review is an important process that the Albanese government fully supports.” Pitt said on Tuesday that he was “incredibly disappointed for the people of Kimba”. He told ABC TV the majority of those on the council roll wanted the facility and the piece of land chosen for the facility “did not have a native title”. According to the industry and resources department, the Barngarla people are the traditional owners and the site sits within the Barngarla determination area but “native title has been extinguished over the freehold land of the project area”. The Barngarla people say it contains significant cultural and heritage sites, including women’s sites. Elder Aunty Dawn Taylor said she was now “so happy for the women’s sites and dreaming on our country that are not in the firing line of a waste dump”. Pitt claimed that without the facility the country’s ability to provide nuclear medicine was under threat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-30T09:33:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 492 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that its troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told Ukrainian television. Russia is gradually reducing the number of personnel at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. The GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. It said Ukrainian employees who have signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and have been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula. Overnight the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, and air defence forces shot down ten drones. Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Local Russian-imposed officials said that air defence had repelled the attack. Video distributed on social media appeared to show smoke rising over the occupied city. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up carrying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia claimed the strike was on a military target. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that he believes the west is aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. He also accused the west of having a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. Lavrov also described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, following reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay a ratification of the membership. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. Poland has detained a Russian ice-hockey player playing for a first division Polish team on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday, describing him as the 14th person that had been arrested from one espionage network. The Kremlin has declined to answer questions about the whereabouts of Sergei Surovikin amid unconfirmed reports that the Russian army general had been detained and was being questioned by the security services. US intelligence has claimed that Surovikin, who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine, had prior knowledge of Prigozhin’s uprising, in which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and moved on Moscow before striking an amnesty deal. Surovikin has not been seen in public since Saturday. Asked if the Kremlin could clarify the situation with Surovikin, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “No, unfortunately not. So I recommend that you contact the defence ministry. This is its prerogative.” Former US President Donald Trump has said now is the time for the US to try to broker a negotiated peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine and that Vladimir Putin has been “somewhat weakened” by Wagner’s aborted mutiny. “I want people to stop dying over this ridiculous war,” Trump told Reuters in an interview. Trump said everything would be “subject to negotiation” if he were president. Mike Pence met Volodymyr Zelenskiy Thursday during surprise Ukraine trip. Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet the Ukrainian president during the US campaign. Pence told NBC News: “Coming here just as a private citizen … just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” The Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Kherson region on Thursday denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridgehead over the Dnipro river at the location of the Antonivskyi Bridge. He has also claimed that Russian forces repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. Russia said it was opening criminal cases against what it claimed to be 160 mercenaries from 33 different countries who were operating on behalf of Ukrainian forces in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T18:06:22Z","webTitle":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","fields":{"bodyText":"We are now closing this live blog. Here is a summary of today’s events: Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region – one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, a study finds. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said. The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to around 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the UK’s ministry of defence said. Russia was one of a small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s state funeral in London today that included Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, has criticised Russia after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Reuters reports that in a video posted on social media, he told Luhansk People’s Republic leader Leonid Pasechnik in a phone call that “our actions should be synchronised”. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Lambrecht said the 10 howitzers already supplied by Germany and eight from the Netherlands “have proven themselves in battle.” She said: Ukraine is full of praise of the system and has expressed a desire for more howitzers. In order to further support Ukraine in its brave fight against the brutal Russian attack, Germany will grant this request.” Lambrecht said the Panzerhaubitze 2000 model howitzers recently underwent refurbishment. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said, adding: “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraine’s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his “special military operation” in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv. Over the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river’s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. On Monday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. You can read the full report here. More on the mass grave in Izium. Reuters reports that Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said around 450 bodies are believed to have been buried at the site in a forest on the outskirts of Izium, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region. A hearing in Moscow to decide on the future of the Jewish Agency’s activities in Russia has been postponed for four weeks after lawyers for the charity, which facilitates immigration of Jewish people to Israel, asked for time to submit amendments to the agency’s scope of operations. Russia’s justice ministry first recommended in June that the Jewish Agency - a quasi-governmental body - be shut down for violating Russian privacy laws. A hearing in August was delayed by the Basmanny city court to 19 September, and delayed again today for another four weeks. Israel has been caught in a delicate balancing act since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February: the country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next-door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and forceful diplomatic action. Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agency’s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations. About 24,000 Russians have arrived in Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency. Around 165,000 people with Jewish heritage were estimated to live in Russia at the beginning of 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and how expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Russia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the world’s wheat supply. Researchers in the United States and Uruguay modelled the likely impact of the conflict on wheat and maize prices over the coming 12 months, looking at a variety of scenarios for the study published in Nature Food. One model found that if Russian grain exports were halved and Ukrainian exports significantly reduced during that time, maize would be 4.6% more expensive and wheat 7.2% more expensive - even assuming that other exporters could step in and plug the gap. The researchers said the price increase would persist as long as exports remained restricted, Agence France-Press reports. To close the supply shortfall, the study found that other major producers would need to expand their grain-growing areas significantly. Were all grain exports from Ukraine to cease, Australia would need to expand its wheat area by 1%, China by 1.5%, the European Union by 1.9% and India by 1.2%, according to the model. This land-use change would lead to just over a billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent added to the atmosphere, the study said. Lead author Jerome Dumortier, a researcher at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Indianapolis in the US, said: The cropland expansion resulting from the war in Ukraine is occurring at the expense of more carbon emissions,” said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned in July that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had combined with the lingering trade impacts of Covid-19 to create an “unprecedented global hunger crisis”. Figures from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization show food prices are currently more than 10% higher than they were a year ago. Although Moscow and Kyiv reached an agreement in July to resume some grain exports, there are fears that the conflict could lead to years of elevated food prices. Dumortier said that it was not currently clear whether other grain producers were able to meet global demand, meaning prices could rise even further than predicted in the models. “There are drought conditions in South America, Europe, and China, and export restrictions from various countries,” he told AFP. “Given those hindrances to full adjustment, commodity prices may be higher than what is estimated in the paper.” Ukraine’s first lady said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Olena Zelenska, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, was among hundreds of heads of state and dignitaries from around the world gathered in Westminster Abbey for the service on Monday. She represented her nation at the ceremony on behalf of her husband, as he continues to organise the fightback against Russian invaders, PA News reports. Zelenska said the Queen’s attention to Ukraine “was an important signal of support”. She wrote on Twitter: She wished us better times and shared our desire for freedom. We will always remember it with deep gratitude.” On Sunday, Zelenska visited Westminster Hall for the Queen’s lying in state to pay her respects to the Queen. She was pictured bowing her head as she stood alongside Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal and Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko. Earlier she met the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. Zelenska travelled to the UK after her husband last week signed a book of condolence for the Queen. The UK’s ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, said she was “deeply honoured” by the president’s gesture. She added: Grateful to the president for taking the time to do this given all else that is happening in (Ukraine) at this time.” Ukrainian troops have been taking part in a major counter-offensive against Russia’s forces. Zelenskiy appeared to be a fan of the Queen, having been given a biography of the Queen by Boris Johnson during the then-prime minister’s visit to Kyiv in June. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said on Monday. Reuters reports that the ministry said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail on to the grounds of the Russian embassy in Ottawa. The ministry also said “aggressive” demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. Here is a summary of events so far: The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China.

The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. A selection of recent pictures from the agencies My colleagues Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report on the Ukrainian recapture of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region, with liberated Ukrainians telling of life under occupation. Until last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayor’s office in the town of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region. There was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin “leader”, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkove’s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian. Strezhko’s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraine’s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators. Shevchenkove’s acting military administrator, Andrii Konashavych, pointed to the chair where the pseudo-mayor had sat in the council building. On the wall was a portrait of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine’s national poet who gives his name to the town. What happened to the Putin photo? “We tore it up,” Konashavych said. Why was there no picture of President Zelenskiy? “Presidents come and go. Shevchenko is eternal,” he replied. Read the full report here. The Kremlin said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian president Vladimir Putin, described the “strengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russia’s foreign policy.” During a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of China’s Communist party, Patrushev said: In the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.” After the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping, Patrushev’s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to: …expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.” The Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized a need to expand cooperation on cybersecurity and bolster contacts between their law enforcement agencies on fighting terrorism. The statement didn’t offer any further details of prospective cooperation. Putin met with Chinese president Xi Jinping last week in Uzbekistan, their first encounter since the Russian leader invaded Ukraine in February. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting said Xi promised “strong support” for Russia’s “core interests.” Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships. Party insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”. Read the full report here. The Associated Press has a preview of this week’s meeting of the UN general assembly: Facing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europe’s first major war since World War II — a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War. The many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fuelled tide of misinformation and hate speech — all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year. For the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighbouring Russia. Its invasion not only threatens Ukraine‘s survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said the strategic divides — with the west on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other — are “paralysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face”. He pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but to the war’s impact on the global economy. Escalating food and energy prices are hitting the world’s poorest people hardest, and nations are “being devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest” instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the UN charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. Scholz, whose two-day trip will also take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will become the latest Western leader to meet with the crown prince. Bin Salman has been regarded as a pariah in the West due to his suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But he is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels after Russia cut gas supplies amid soaring tensions over its invasion of Ukraine. Agence France-Press reports: Scholz, accompanied by a business delegation, will visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he will meet with the crown prince and - if his health permits it - King Salman, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He did not go into detail about the reasons for Scholz’s Gulf visit but said he would be “very surprised” if the topic of energy was not discussed. The spokesman also offered assurances that “the murder of Mr Khashoggi will certainly figure in discussions”. It is the latest sign of bin Salman’s international rehabilitation - in July, French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with him in Paris, and US President Joe Biden visited the kingdom. On Sunday, Scholz will head to the UAE and meet with President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and in the afternoon will hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. German economy minister Robert Habeck already visited Qatar and the UAE in March in an effort to find alternatives to Russian gas, which Germany has traditionally depended on heavily. Russia’s decision to cut off supplies has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, with consumers and businesses facing soaring bills as winter approaches. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have sentenced an employee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - the world’s largest regional security organisation - to 13 years in jail on treason charges, Russian news agencies reported Monday. “A panel of judges found Dmitry Pavlovich Shabanov guilty … and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LNR). Shabanov, who was detained in April, is accused of passing confidential information to foreign intelligence services, Agence France-Presse reports. According to separatist authorities, Shabanov was recruited in 2016 by a former officer of Ukraine’s SBU security service and an agent in Ukraine of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Between August 2021 and April 2022, he collected “information on the movements of military equipment as well as units of the Lugansk People’s Army” and “sent them to the CIA agent”, the separatists said. The OSCE has “unequivocally” condemned the charges against Shabanov and Mikhail Petrov, another OSCE staffer detailed in April, describing the allegations as “totally unacceptable so-called ‘legal proceedings’”. The OSCE mission, which has been deployed in the conflict zone since 2014, left the separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk in the wake of Russia’s offensive in Ukraine earlier this year. Here is what we know so far regarding the more than 440 graves that have been uncovered in a forest near Izium in eastern Ukraine. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), some of the bodies recovered had their hands tied. Others showed signs of having suffered violence. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the discovery of a mass grave in Izium after it was recaptured from the Russians. At one burial site, more than 440 graves dating between March and September 2022 were discovered. Investigators have exhumed the bodies of at least 17 Ukrainian soldiers from one site. A cross over the grave bore the inscription: “Ukrainian army, 17 people. Izium morgue.” The authorities say there are more than 440 tombs because the last number entered on the crosses is 445. Some of the crosses are made from varnished wood and also carry names and dates. Investigators say about 100 bodies have been exhumed. Ukrainian officials suspect that some of the dead were tortured by Russian forces during their occupation of the north-east Kharkiv region. At least two of the bodies recovered were found with their hands tied, AFP journalists said. One of the two “had their hands tied, their jaw broken and two stab wounds in the back”, a member of the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office told AFP on condition of anonymity. The remains have been identified as that of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer fighter, the official added. Civilians who died during fighting in March for control of the city have also been exhumed. Around 10 teams – each of around four people, including representatives of the prosecutor’s office – have been at work investigating following the discovery of the graves. Emergency service workers in white overalls were handling the exhumations. Kharkiv prosecutor Yevgen Sokolov, who is leading the investigation, said he did not have an exact number for those thought to have suffered violent deaths. Of the bodies so far exhumed, he said “most have wounds from shelling and explosions”. Others had suffered “injuries from sharp objects and showed signs of violent death”, he said. Sokolov said one combatant had had “his hands tied behind his back” and another was found with “rope around the neck and broken limbs”. He also said a body was exhumed “with multiple stab wounds”. “At this point, we don’t have bodies with bullets in their skulls but there is still a lot of work to be done,” he said. If the weather remained mild, he estimated it would take another week to finish exhuming the bodies. Europe’s imports of thermal coal in 2022 could be the highest in at least four years and may rise further next year, analysts said on Monday, highlighting the extent of the energy crisis following sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. European imports of thermal coal this year could rise to about 100m tonnes, the most since 2017, according to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, while commodities pricing agency Argus expects shipments to reach a four-year high. “Europe is going back in time,” Rodrigo Echeverri, head of research at Noble, told a conference. European governments have outlined new measures on how they will cope with potential energy shortages this winter, with Russian gas flows still running at severely reduced rates amid the Ukraine war. Reuters reports that Spain has drawn up plans that could force energy-intensive industries to shut at peak demand times. France said it was preparing to send gas to Germany from October, while Berlin said Europe’s powerhouse was still in talks on state aid for ailing utility Uniper. Russia, which had supplied about 40% of the European Union’s gas before its February invasion of Ukraine, has said it closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – once one of Europe’s major gas supply routes – because western sanctions hindered operations. European gas prices have more than doubled from the start of the year amid a decline in Russian supplies. The sharp drop in Russian fuel exports has left governments scrambling to find energy resources, but also to warn that power cuts could happen, amid fears of recession. In France, exports of natural gas to Germany could start around 10 October, the head of France’s CRE energy regulator said, following an announcement by president Emmanuel Macron that the two EU neighbours would help each other with electricity and gas flows amid the crisis. CRE chief Emmanuelle Wargon told FranceInfo radio: Gas was (until now) only flowing from Germany to France, so we did not have the technical tools to reverse the flows and we did not even have a method to regulate prices.” Wargon added that “exceptional” measures this winter could include localised electricity cuts if the winter is cold and EDF’s plans to repair corrosion-hit nuclear reactors are delayed. “But there will be no gas cuts for households. Never,” she said. Spanish industry minister Reyes Maroto said that obliging energy-intensive companies to close down during consumption peaks is an option on the table this winter if required. The companies would be compensated financially, she said adding there is no need to impose such closures now. And Finns were warned they should be prepared for power outages. National grid operator Fingrid said: As a result of great uncertainties, Finns should be prepared for power outages caused by a possible power shortage in the coming winter.” Finnish power retailer Karhu Voima Oy said it had filed for bankruptcy due to a sharp rise in electricity price rises. German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Monday that he was still looking at ways to ensure gas prices remained affordable for people while awaiting recommendations from a group of experts. When asked about a possible cap on gas prices Lindner said: We have developed this commission, but proposals within the federal government are also being considered further, so it has not been completely outsourced.” The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank said: The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying.” It also warned of a “broad-based and prolonged decline in economic output”. The likely slump was above all down to “supply-side constraints”, namely reduced deliveries of energy in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. Moscow has drastically reduced it supplies of gas to Europe and kept the Nord Stream pipeline shut since the end of August, heaping pressure on Germany’s economy. Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy imports with 55% of its gas coming from Russia before the outbreak of the war. The economy would likely shrink “slightly” in the third quarter of the year, the Bundesbank said, before a “marked” drop over the last three months of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. The Russian gas supply stop meant that the situation regarding gas markets was “very tense”, it said. Germany could “avoid formal rationing” of the fuel, but necessary reductions in consumption would lead companies to limit or pause production, the central bank predicted. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on the Telegram messenger app, Donetsk’s separatist mayor Alexei Kulemzin said that 13 civilians including two children had been killed in the strike on Donetsk’s Kuybyshevsky district. He said that the number of wounded was being confirmed. Donetsk city has been controlled by the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic since 2014. The Ukrainian army continues to hold positions on Donetsk’s outskirts, and the city has come under artillery fire repeatedly in recent months. The Guardian is unable to verify battlefield reports. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. About 450 bodies, most of which Ukraine says are those of civilians, have been found in mass graves near Izium after Russian troops were this month forced out of the Kharkiv region, much of which they had controlled since the first weeks of their military campaign in Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said investigators at the site had found evidence of torture, including bodies with hands tied, and accused Russian troops of committing war crimes. Asked on Monday about Zelenskiy’s statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “It’s the same scenario as in Bucha. It’s a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story.” Russia previously rejected claims that its troops had committed war crimes in Bucha, outside Kyiv, after evidence of civilians being killed while the town was controlled by Russian troops came to light after Russia’s withdrawal at the end of March. (Via Reuters) Last week, Zelenskiy accused Russia of “leaving death everywhere” after the discovery of the Izium site. Men in white overalls began digging out bodies last Friday as part of a mass exhumation at the site, reporters with the Reuters news agency said, and 20 white bodybags could be seen. Reuters reported that several bodies had rope tied around their necks and hands. Ukraine’s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, has described the Russian missile strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant – see earlier post here – as an act of “nuclear terrorism”. (Via AP) Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian can reveal. The Football Union of Russia has written to the governing body accusing Oleksandr Petrakov of discriminating against Russians and failing to remain politically neutral. Denis Rogachev, the deputy secretary general of the FUR, cited comments carried in two newspapers – Italy’s Corriere dello Sport and Russia’s Sport Express – as evidence of Petrakov’s guilt. In a letter to Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body, Petrakov is accused of breaching codes of conduct by calling for Russians to be banned from international sport and talking about his hopes of joining the armed forces. Full story here. The US president, Joe Biden, used an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes programme on Sunday night to warn Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. When asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader was mulling such a move, he said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Biden praised the Ukrainians for their gritty fight against the Russian invasion and said: “They’re defeating Russia”. Asked how to define victory for Kyiv, he said: “Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely.” But given the scale of human suffering and destruction inflicted in resisting the Russian onslaught, “it’s awful hard to count that as winning”, he added. Reuters has more information on the Russian strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the early hours of Monday: Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. A blast took place 300 metres away from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings shortly after midnight, Energoatom said in a statement. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Energoatom said: Currently, all three power units of the PNPP (Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant) are operating normally. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff It published two photographs showing a crater it said was caused by the blast. In one of the pictures a man stood in the crater to give a sense of its size. Commenting on the strike on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine‘s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: The invaders wanted to shoot again, but they forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before it’s too late. There was no immediate Russian reaction to Ukraine’s accusations. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces in recent weeks. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia - which is Europe’s largest and lies about 250km (155 miles) east of the Mykolaiv site - was shut down earlier this month due to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend one of the four main power lines at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russian troops have struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Reuters reports. According to Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, a blast early on Monday took place 300 metres from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. There is a realistic possibility that the increase in losses was partially a result of the Russian air force accepting greater risk in a move to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances, the defence ministry said in its daily intelligence on Twitter. Russian pilots’ situational awareness is often poor, it said. “There is a realistic possibility that some aircraft have strayed over enemy territory and into denser air defence zones as the frontlines have moved rapidly.” (Via Reuters) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s funeral in London today, as AFP reports: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – under a travel ban to the UK due to sanctions – had already said he would not attend. But not inviting any Russian representative to the Queen’s funeral was “particularly blasphemous towards Elizabeth II’s memory” and “deeply immoral”, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow said on Thursday. Russia and Belarus have embassies in London and their presidents sent King Charles III messages of condolences. Other countries with no invitations are Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Good morning. This is Sam Jones taking over now from my colleague Virginia. Ukrainians flee shelling of Kupiansk as Russian forces try to slow advances On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. As Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report, cars packed with families streamed out of the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine recaptured just over a week ago as part of a stunning counter-offensive. Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, sits on either side of the river. It is on the new frontline after Ukrainian forces on Friday crossed to the right bank. They are now poised to push further into Luhansk province, which the Kremlin and its local proxies have controlled entirely since June, and partly since 2014. Here’s the full story. Russian pop star speaks out against war in Ukraine The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” Read more here. Milley: “Not going too well for Russia” The top US general on Sunday said it was still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine and called for vigilance among US troops as he visited a base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort, Reuters reported. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Some recent images from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Russian attacks in east and south repelled, says Ukraine military Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region, said this meant the “de-occupation” of his region was “not far away”. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. “Putin’s souring relationship with the military command and the Russian (MoD) may explain in part the Kremlin’s increasing focus on recruiting ill-prepared volunteers into ad-hoc irregular units rather than attempting to draw them into reserve or replacement pools for regular Russian combat units,” the ISW said. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Virginia Harrison and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s just after 8am in Kyiv and these are the main developments: The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. “Perhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly address on Sunday. “But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.” In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” it said on Sunday. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium”, adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice”, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/aug/07/bidenomics-lessons-labour-looks-to-democrats-as-it-prepares-for-power","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-07T13:00:40Z","webTitle":"Bidenomics lessons: Labour looks to Democrats as it prepares for power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/07/bidenomics-lessons-labour-looks-to-democrats-as-it-prepares-for-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/aug/07/bidenomics-lessons-labour-looks-to-democrats-as-it-prepares-for-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Rachel Reeves dismayed many in the green movement this year when she announced a Labour government would phase in its £28bn green growth plan rather than spending the full amount straight away. The shadow chancellor had been mulling such an announcement for a while, but decided on it for sure after being warned two weeks earlier by senior members of Joe Biden’s administration not to rush the rollout of Labour’s flagship scheme. People briefed on Reeves’s conversations during a pivotal trip to Washington in May have told the Guardian she was warned about problems the Biden administration has had in implementing green subsidies, thanks to complex US planning laws. They advised her she should consider planning reform before announcing how new green incentives would be spent. The impact of US officials’ advice on Labour policy – Reeves met the Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Biden’s economic adviser Lael Brainard while in Washington – is a reflection of the growing closeness between Labour and the Democrats as both face crucial elections in 2024. In an echo of the relationship between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton that helped redefine politics in the 1990s, those close to the Democrats and the Labour party are once again cooperating closely on policy and strategy. The conversations particularly focus on the economy and trade, with the shadow trade secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, telling the Guardian that Labour would be ideally placed to sign a raft of trade agreements with the Biden administration should both win their pushes for power next year. If both parties do win, they are promising to pursue a more interventionist economic policy that could redefine progressive politics and policy for a generation. Mathew Lawrence, the director of the leftwing UK thinktank Common Wealth, said: “The policy dialogue is stronger than it has been for a while. Bidenomics is setting itself up as a break from the third way economics of Clinton and Blair, with more direct intervention into markets, and a sharper focus on distribution. Labour is learning from that.” Heather Boushey, an economic adviser to Biden, said: “The US and UK have long been swimming in the same currents, from the relationship between [the former president] Franklin D Roosevelt and [the British economist] John Maynard Keynes, through [Ronald] Reagan and [Margaret] Thatcher, to Blair and Clinton. “It is exciting now as we put together the ideas behind Bidenomics … how much the two countries are once more learning from each other.” Reeves, who used to work in Washington as an economist in the British embassy, gave a speech during her visit in which she set out more clearly than ever how much Labour’s economic policy is aligned with the Biden administration’s. “Globalisation as we once knew it is dead,” she declared as she called for the government to invest heavily in certain industries and help protect workers with greater employment rights. One person close to the White House said those around the president had been impressed with the speech, describing it as a “wow” moment. Reeves’s visit was one of a series of transatlantic visits, seminars and policy conversations that have taken place over the past two years as Labour and the Democrats have honed their economic, energy and trade agendas. A year earlier Ed Miliband also visited Washington as he was developing his ideas for Labour’s £28bn green prosperity plan. While there, the shadow energy secretary met policy thinkers including John Podesta, the head of the Center for American Progress, who has since gone on to advise Biden on the clean energy transition. Those close to Miliband say the visit helped convince him he needed to sell his green vision in terms of what it means for the economy and jobs, rather than solely for the environment. Earlier this year, Miliband gave a speech comparing his plan directly to the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act, saying: “We need to stop moaning about the Inflation Reduction Act … Sore loser syndrome won’t win any jobs for Britain.” Boushey said she had advised her British counterparts not to be ideological about how to manage the transition to cleaner energy. “When we’re dealing with the existential threat of climate change it’s really important to get solutions that work at scale and you can get across the finish line,” she said. A month after Reeves’s visit, Morgan McSweeney, Labour’s campaign director, was in the White House meeting Neera Tanden, the director of Biden’s domestic policy council. McSweeney’s visit coincided with the official visit of Rishi Sunak to Washington, and was kept quiet at the time for fear of upsetting diplomatic relations. Last month, Thomas-Symonds also travelled to Washington, where he met the US trade representative, Katherine Tai. The pair talked about a potential digital trade deal in the future, in a sign of how seriously the Biden administration is taking the prospect of a Labour win. Thomas-Symonds said: “My visit and that of Rachel Reeves before me were a real statement of intent that we share the fundamental beliefs of the Biden administration in jobs-led growth and secure supply chains.” Thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic are also cooperating closely. The Institute for Public Policy Research, possibly the most influential thinktank with Keir Starmer’s Labour party, has held regular forums with American counterparts such as Todd Tucker, the director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute. Tucker gave a briefing in February to members of staff for both Starmer and Reeves during which he stressed the Biden administration wanted to use international trade deals to boost labour and environmental protections around the world. If Labour were to win the next election it should do the same, he urged. “There are a lot of opportunities for the UK to join the US in shaping the world, including in things like international trade negotiations,” Tucker said. In Washington, the Progressive Policy Institute, a thinktank that was closely allied with Clinton and is now influential in Biden’s White House, has hired Claire Ainsley, Starmer’s former policy chief, to direct a project on centre-left renewal. “Rachel’s visit and her speech rightly referenced the economic agenda that the Biden administration is pursuing. For Labour right now, that is a beacon of what a modern industrial strategy can look like,” Ainsley said. Back in the UK, Common Wealth has hired an American researcher, Melanie Brusseler, to explore what the US Inflation Reduction Act might mean for the UK. She said: “The experience of the pandemic has been that really robust intervention can work. Both Labour and the Democrats are now in this moment of rethinking state intervention.” Labour strategists say they are also looking to other countries for inspiration, including Australia and Germany, where centre-left parties recently won elections after a long period out of power. But the history of UK-US ties, and the recent memory of Blair and Clinton together developing “third way” politics, have persuaded many on the British and American left they can jointly remake their countries once again. “I remember seeing a high-profile conference with Clinton and Blair and thinking these guys seem intent on shredding the social safety net,” said Tucker. “Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic are only now catching up with the ramifications of that, and looking to do something about it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T04:32:55Z","webTitle":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","fields":{"bodyText":"Japan is considering building next-generation nuclear reactors and restarting idled plants in a major policy shift, 11 years after the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant rocked the country’s dependence on atomic energy. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said he had directed a government panel to look into how “next-generation nuclear reactors equipped with new safety mechanisms” could be used to help Japan achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. His “green transformation” council is expected to report back by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday. The change of direction, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors, have highlighted Japan’s struggle to secure a stable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and soaring energy costs. Successive governments have been forced to lower Japan’s dependence on nuclear since the March 2011 disaster, when a powerful tsunami destroyed Fukushima Daiichi’s backup electricity supply, causing three of its six reactors to suffer meltdowns. Most of Japan’s nuclear plants have remained idle ever since, while the government said it would not build new reactors or replace ageing reactors, fearing a public backlash. If realised, Kishida’s plans would mark a dramatic reversal of that stance. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has vastly transformed the world’s energy landscape … Japan needs to bear in mind potential crisis scenarios,” he said at an energy policy meeting this week. “To overcome an imminent crisis caused of a power supply crunch, we must take the utmost steps to mobilise all possible policies in the coming years and prepare for any emergency.” The economy and industry minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said it was “extremely important to secure all options to redesign a stable energy supply for our country. From that perspective, we will also consider all options regarding nuclear power.” Kishida conceded that the government would have to win support from the public, which turned against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Officials believe voters have become more receptive to nuclear power due to rising fuel costs and after an energy crunch in Tokyo during a recent heatwave. The country is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. “It is the first step towards the normalisation of Japan’s energy policy,” said Jun Arima, a project professor at the Tokyo University’s graduate school of public policy. Seven reactors are currently in operation, with three others offline for regular safety inspections. Dozens of others are still going through a relicensing process under stricter safety standards introduced after the 2011 disaster, which some experts blamed on the “nuclear village” of operators, politicians and regulators. A bigger role for nuclear in Japan’s energy mix could see seven additional reactors being restarted after next summer, including two at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, the biggest nuclear plant in the world. Restarting the plant would be particularly controversial, since it is run by Tokyo Electric Power, the same company that operates Fukushima Daiichi. The 2011 disaster sent huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Some areas near the plant remain off-limits, while others have only recently reopened to residents. The government will also consider extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the legal limit by excluding the period they remained shut down – in some cases several years – when calculating their operating time. Plants can operate for up to 40 years in principle, but can continue generating electricity for another 20 years if they undergo safety upgrades and pass screenings conducted by regulators. Japan has set a target for nuclear power generation to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030. Before the Fukushima meltdowns, about a third of its power generation came from nuclear, but in 2020 the figure was less than 5%.

He was asked a question about whether the Russian president could escalate actions in Ukraine after the disarray caused by the failed Wagner mutiny during a press conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, in Helsinki following the US-Nordic leaders’ summit. Biden also said he was “serious about prisoner exchange” when asked about the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in a Moscow prison for more than 100 days. Three people have been killed by Russian shelling across Ukraine. A man in his 40s was killed by shelling in the Zaporizhzhia region. A 60-year-old in Sumy and an 85-year-old woman in Kherson were also killed by Russian shelling. Russia’s nuclear chief denies claims Moscow plotted to blow up Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Alexei Likhachev said that only “a complete idiot” would do such a reckless thing. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, told CNN on Thursday he had “no doubt” that Ukraine would become part of Nato after Russia’s war against the country ends. Speaking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, Austin said: “I have no doubt that will happen, and we heard just about every country in the room say as much.” Ukraine’s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. “I wouldn’t pay too much attention to what he said,” Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday. “Everyone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it … I know for sure this isn’t his actual position.” Ukraine claims its air defences during the night shot down all 20 Shahed drones and two Kalibr missiles launched by Russia. At least four people in Kyiv were injured by falling debris, and Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk reported eight civilian injuries in the last 24 hours. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership “the truth” about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner’s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army, which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed a “good result” from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain’s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Zelenskiy’s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note: “For the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.” A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn’t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as “resting” and “not available”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, reported sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but stated that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has suggested that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. Reuters reports that the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on Thursday urged Vladimir Putin to prolong a deal allowing the Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain, saying the consequence of not doing so would be global food insecurity. The ball was now in Russia’s court with the whole world watching, Von der Leyen told a press conference. Ukraine’s top security official has dismissed criticism of Kyiv from the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggesting Wallace misspoke due to a surfeit of emotion. “I wouldn’t pay too much attention to what he said,” Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s security council, told the Guardian in Kyiv on Thursday. “Everyone can say something when they are emotional and then regret it … I know for sure this isn’t his actual position.” Wallace criticised Ukraine on Wednesday for treating western allies “like Amazon”, providing lists of weapons it required and for not being thankful enough for western military aid. “Whether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,” said Wallace. The remarks caused surprise and confusion in Kyiv, as they appeared to jar with most British government statements offering unequivocal support for Ukraine, and Wallace had widely been seen as one of Kyiv’s biggest champions among western politicians. Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that supplies of new weapons to Ukraine would change nothing on the battlefield but would only further escalate the conflict there, Reuters reports. Putin, speaking on state television, said tanks provided by western powers to Ukraine would be a “priority target” for Russian forces fighting there. He reiterated his opposition to Ukraine joining Nato, saying this would threaten Russia’s security. Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia could withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal until other sides fulfil their promises, Reuters reports. The deal, which allows for the safe export of Ukrainian grain and fertiliser from Black Sea ports, is due to expire on Monday. Moscow has repeatedly threatened to block its extension over aspects of its implementation affecting Russian exports. Putin, speaking on state television, said Russia was in contact with the UN on the matter but said he had not seen a message addressed to him from the UN secretary general suggesting a compromise to salvage the deal. A man in his 40s has been killed by shelling in Orikhiv in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, governor Yuriy Malashko has said. A 60-year-old resident of the village of Popivka in the northern region of Sumy has also been killed by Russian shelling, the prosecutor general’s office said. Earlier on Thursday, an 85-year-old woman was killed after Russian shelling in the village of Mykilske in Kherson, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Twitter that the country would receive €1.5bn in military aid from packages pledged by western allies. He says they will receive long-range Scalp missiles, Leopard tanks, additional Patriots and F-16 pilot training. Danielle Gershkovich, the sister of Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who is currently being detained in a Moscow jail, is due to speak in Washington DC shortly. We will bring you the top lines. Biden says there is “no real prospect of Putin using nuclear weapons” when asked about whether the Russian president could escalate actions in Ukraine after the disarray caused by the failed Wagner mutiny. Biden says he is “serious about prisoner exchange” when asked about Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained in a Moscow prison for over 100 days. Biden says: “I’m serious about doing all we can to free Americans being illegally held in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. That process is under way.” Biden is asked what actions he will take to assure Finland that the US will remain a reliable Nato partner for decades to come considering a bipartisan group of senators in Washington attempted to pass a law that would prevent future US presidents from withdrawing from Nato without the Senate’s approval. Biden says: “There is no question there’s overwhelming support from the American people. There’s overwhelming support from the members of Congress, the House and the Senate. In both parties, notwithstanding the fact of some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.” Biden says: “We will defend every inch of Nato territory, including Finland.” This is Biden’s first visit to Finland since it became a Nato member. The US president, Joe Biden, is holding a press conference with Finnish president Sauli Niinistö in Helsinki following the US-Nordic leaders’ summit. You can watch live at the top of the page. The White House has released a statement after a meeting between the US president, Joe Biden, and Nordic leaders which said they “welcomed” Turkey’s stated intention to ratify Sweden’s ascension into Nato. Biden travelled to Helsinki after the Nato summit ended to meet Nordic leaders, including the prime ministers of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö. Reuters reports that the European Commission is helping the UN and Turkey in their efforts to extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain and is open to “explore all solutions that contribute” to ensuring that continues, an EU spokesperson in Brussels said. Luke Harding has been in Dnipro for the Guardian, speaking to two volunteers fighting for Ukraine: Standing on a steep grassy hill, a figure in uniform took aim with a rifle. Several shots pinged into a pile of tyres. Nearby, policemen took turns firing from a DShK heavy machine gun, mounted on a green-painted military vehicle. The rounds echoed around a rustic shooting range, scattering swallows. Down a track was a farmstead with cows. The sniper was not a Ukrainian soldier but a 58-year-old British former marine called Alan, from Plymouth in south-west England. He is one of a small group of foreign volunteers currently fighting in Ukraine, more than 16 months after Russia’s full-scale invasion. Alan declined to give his second name. He arrived last September. Soon he will go back to the frontline. “You have to keep practising,” he said, gesturing at a row of targets, all of which he hit. “The Russians are not on the whole very good soldiers but they are not stupid. It would be foolhardy to assume there are no decent units or motivated troops. They are potent, very dangerous, and good at artillery and electronic warfare.” Read more here: ‘It was like in world war one’: the foreign volunteers fighting in Ukraine Here are some more images today from Kyiv after a building was damaged by drone debris overnight. Elina Svitolina, the Ukrainian tennis player who could become the first wild card to make it into the final of the ladies’ singles competition at Wimbledon, is playing now. Wild cards are players whose world ranking is not high enough to qualify automatically for the competition but who are accepted into it at the discretion of Wimbledon’s committee. On Tuesday, Svitolina pulled off one of the performances of her career in defeating the top seed, Iga Świątek, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 to return to the Wimbledon semi-finals, which she last reached in 2019 when she lost to Simona Halep. Afterwards, she spoke about her hope of bringing “a little happiness” to the people of Ukraine. “I know that lots of people back in Ukraine are watching,” she said. “It definitely means a lot.” The Guardian’s Alexandra Topping has more on Svitolina below: Russia’s nuclear chief on Thursday pushed back against Ukrainian assertions that Moscow had plotted to blow up a nuclear power station it controls, saying no evidence supported the claim and that only “a complete idiot” would do such a reckless thing, Reuters reports. Kyiv has repeatedly said that Russian forces planned to blow up the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russian forces had mined the roof of several reactors at the plant, Europe’s largest, which they seized shortly after launching their full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday it had not seen any mines or explosives during an inspection of the plant, though it said it was waiting for access to the rooftops of reactors No 3 and No 4. “Those who wanted to arrange some sort of provocation there have been exposed,” Alexei Likhachev, the general director of Russia’s state nuclear corporation, Rosatom, told state television, citing the IAEA observations. He said the Ukrainian claims about Russia’s supposed intentions at the plant were part of an information war against Moscow. “You would have to be a complete idiot to blow up a nuclear power station where three and a half thousand people work, including a very significant number of people from all over Russia,” Likhachev said. Likhachev said Russian intelligence and information from captured Ukrainian prisoners indicated that Ukraine had in fact had plans to strike the nuclear power station while repeatedly blaming Russia for the attack. Reuters was unable to verify the claims of either side. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of threatening the safety of the plant. The IAEA has repeatedly said the plant should not be used for storage or as a base for heavy weaponry. It has also said the plant has enough water – used to cool down reactors and spent nuclear fuel – for some months despite the destruction of the nearby Nova Kakhovka dam. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, told CNN on Thursday he had “no doubt” that Ukraine would become part of Nato after Russia’s war against the country ends. Speaking to CNN host Wolf Blitzer, Austin said “I have no doubt that will happen, and we heard just about every country in the room say as much,” When asked how close Ukraine was to meeting Nato standards, Austin said there was still work to be done. He added that others things like “judicial reform” should happen in Ukraine to “make sure that the democracy is in good shape”. The Ukrainian parliament has passed the first reading of bill that would legalise medical cannabis, with the draft law saying one of its uses could be to treat war veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, the Kyiv Independent reports. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spoke in support of the draft law last month when speaking to parliament. The draft law also proposes to license the economic activity of cultivating hemp for medical, industrial, and scientific purposes. It also aims to help people with cancer and other serious illnesses. The bill was supported by 268 out of 405 deputies. An 85-year-old woman has been killed after Russian shelling in the village of Mykilske in Kherson, the region’s governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram on Thursday. Prokudin said: “The Russian army killed an 85-year-old resident of the village of Mykilske. At around 12pm [9am GMT], the occupiers launched an artillery attack on the settlement. One of the shells hit the yard of an elderly woman.” Reuters reports that the state-owned Ukrainian Railways has set up a new freight operator to operate in Europe to improve trade and logistical connections, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on Thursday. Kubrakov said the new operator, “Ukrainian Railways Cargo Poland”, would provide services for transporting freight, coordinate with European rail operators, freight owners and border crossings, and control Ukrainian rolling stock abroad. “Today, the European direction of rail transportation for Ukraine is a matter of fast logistics and support for the Ukrainian economy,” Kubrakov said on Facebook. “Creation of a European operator will enable significant improvement in managing cargo transportation in the European direction. At the same time, we are modernising border infrastructure, increasing its capacity.” Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian’s defence and security editor, notes that the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, failed to namecheck Ben Wallace when responding to a praiseworthy statement about the UK defence secretary from a fellow MP. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has welcomed a “good result” from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain’s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Zelenskiy’s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note, saying: “For the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.” The US president, Joe Biden, concluded a Nato summit on Wednesday denouncing Vladimir Putin as “craven” and promising Zelenskiy full support even without membership in the military alliance. Biden, who has made unifying Nato countries a foreign policy priority, said Putin had badly underestimated their resolve. Ukraine claims its air defences during the night shot down all 20 “Shahed” drones and two Kalibr missiles launched by Russia. At least four people in Kyiv were injured by falling debris, and Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk reported eight civilian injuries in the last 24 hours. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership “the truth” about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner’s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield. A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn’t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as “resting” and “not available”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, reported sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but stated that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has suggested that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. Rishi Sunak’s statement in the Commons had a lengthy section detailing what he claimed were several “firsts” by the UK – notable for coming a day after his defence secretary, Ben Wallace, suggested that Ukraine could have showed more gratitude, in comments which have created a diplomatic ripple. He said: There is no better example of our ability to bring all these elements together and lead on the world stage than our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Our diplomats have led the unprecedented effort to coordinate sanctions against Russia’s economy. Last month we hosted the Ukraine recovery conference, raising over $16bn to help rebuild Ukraine’s economy and bringing in the private sector to help unlock their economic potential. And as the house knows, we have backed Ukraine’s fight for their freedom and sovereignty since the start. As the first country in the world to train Ukrainian troops. First in Europe to provide lethal weapons. First to commit tanks. First to provide long range missiles. And now we’re at the forefront of a coalition to equip the Ukrainian air force, with Ukrainian pilots starting their training here in just a few weeks time. We do all of this because it’s right. Because it protects our values and our interests. Because it keeps our people and our allies safe. And because quite simply, it is who we are as a country. We were there at the start of the Nato alliance. And this week, we’ve shown once again that we remain at its heart, leading it into the future. Replying to the statement, the leader of the opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, said that even if there was a change of government in the UK – an election is expected next year – nothing would change the country’s resolve to support Ukraine. Sunak has praised the resilience of the Ukrainian people, and also stated that the British people should be proud that the UK is at the heart of Nato. With the additional of a couple of more detailed paragraphs for the domestic audience and his own party’s MPs in parliament, the speech is fundamentally the same as this statement from yesterday. Rishi Sunak is making an almost indentical statement to the one that he gave in Vilnius yesterday. He has praised Nato as the most successful alliance in history, and said it is more united than ever before. The UK prime minister Rishi Sunak is about to make a post-Nato summit statement in the House of Commons in London. You should be able to watch it live in the blog. You may have to refresh the page for the play button to appear. We will bring you the key lines that emerge. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has used his Telegram channel to report sustained instances of cross-border shelling from Ukraine, but states that no injuries were incurred, and there was only minor damage. The claims have not been independently verified. A Russian general said he had been fired as a commander after telling the military leadership “the truth” about the dire situation at the front in Ukraine, as tensions in the Russian army grow in the aftermath of Wagner’s short-lived mutiny. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms Army which is fighting on the front in Ukraine near Zaporizhzhia, said in a voice message that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire as well as deaths and injuries the army is suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Popov’s emotional address was published late Wednesday by Andrei Gurulyov, a retired Russian colonel general and Duma deputy. Without naming them, Popov appeared to attack army head Valery Gerasimov and defence minister Sergei Shoigu, two of the country’s most powerful military men, accusing them of stabbing the country in the back. The open criticism of the military leadership by a senior Russian commander is rare and will dent the sense of unity that the Kremlin has been eager to project following Yevgeney Prigozhin’s aboard rebellion. Deborah Haynes, the Sky News security and defence editor, offers this analysis this morning on the diplomatic impact of the UK defence secretary Ben Wallace’s words yesterday about whether Ukraine had shown enough gratitude for being armed. She writes: Wallace was not being critical about a lack of gratitude specifically to the UK for its support. Instead, he had been attempting to make a wider point about the wisdom of persuasion when dealing with certain politicians in Washington and other Nato capitals who would rather spend taxpayers’ money on domestic issues than a war in a distant part of Europe. Countries that do not feel in existential peril cannot be guaranteed to maintain their support for Ukraine for as long as the war rages on. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Kyiv, showing the impact of drone debris on a high-rise building. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has reported that the person killed earlier in Kyiv died as a result of a domestic fire, and not as a result of action by the Russian Federation. Mayor Vitali Klitschko had earlier said the body of one resident was recovered when emergency services put out a fire in the capital’s historic Podil district, and it had been assumed that the fire had been started by falling drone debris, but according to the state emergency services this is not the case. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has this morning published its latest intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine, and it suggests that Russian forces have been using improvised car bombs in Donetsk region, possibly instigated due to the experience of the Chechen forces deployed there. It writes: In June 2023, there have been several reports of Russian forces using antiquated armoured vehicles packed with several tonnes of explosives as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The crew likely bail out of the vehicle after setting it on its course. Most Russian VBIED cases have been reported around Marinka, near Donetsk city, and started days after Chechen units reinforced the area: there is a realistic possibility that Chechen forces are pioneering the tactic. There is a heritage of Chechen fighters being skilled in IED use, dating back to the Chechen Wars from the 1990s. Chechens fighting for Ukraine were also reported to have made similar VBIEDs in January 2023. Most of Russia’s VBIEDs have almost certainly detonated before they reached their target through a combination of anti-tank mines and direct fire, bringing into question the viability of the capability. However, these VBIEDs cause extremely large explosions, which are still likely to have a psychological effect on defending forces. The claims have not been independently verified. Reuters has a quick snap that on Thursday the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he had not heard any new proposals on the Black Sea grain export deal, which is due to expire on Monday. Russia has repeatedly threatened to pull out of the deal, citing western sanctions limiting its own agricultural exports. The country also claims to have recorded record grain exports over the last year. The overnight news summary from Suspilne has just been published on its Telegram channel. It reports: Air defence during the night shot down all 20 “Shahed” drones and two Kalibr missiles. The consequences of the launch of the Iskander-M ballistic missile are being clarified. In Kyiv, debris from downed drones damaged houses – four people were injured. At night, the Russian army attacked Antonivka and Kherson. Over the past day, three people were killed and two were injured in the Kherson region. Eight people were injured in Donetsk region, one in Kharkiv region. The number of people injured due to the fall of an explosive object in Zaporizhzhia on 12 July increased to 21 people, including eight children. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, has posted an operational update listing a number of settlements that suffered bombardment and “massive artillery shelling” damaging houses and residential buildings. He stated that “In total, the Russians wounded 8 residents of Donetsk region in one day.” The claims have not been independently verified. Donetsk is one of the partially occupied regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has an update on the damage in Kyiv after yet another night where Russia has struck at Ukraine’s capital – the third night in a row. It reports: In the Darnytskyi district of Kyiv, during a night attack, a fragment of a downed drone hit the 25th floor of a building, destroying one of the apartments. The man whose apartment was hit was at home – he was wounded by shrapnel, he was given help, now he is in a stable condition, reports our correspondent, who managed to talk to him. According to the police officer on the spot, a girl in a neighbouring house was also injured and was hospitalised. The claims have not been independently verified. If the Nato summit was marked by what could be considered some frustrated and undiplomatic words by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday, then the UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, also appeared to make some candid and forthright assertions – that Ukrainians could show a bit more gratitude and that the west was not an “Amazon” for weapon supplies. As my colleague Dan Sabbagh reported yesterday: Wallace said that “whether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude”, when asked about Zelenskiy’s frustration at not being presented with a formal invitation to join Nato, and he advised Ukraine that it might help if it took a different approach. Wallace said it was not the first time he had spoken to Kyiv about this. “I told them that last year, when I drove 11 hours to be given a list, that I’m not like Amazon,” he said, and he observed that Ukraine had a habit of, once it had obtained one type of weapon, immediately starting to lobby for another. You could have anticipated some response to this in Kyiv and beyond in Ukraine, and this morning the Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko is one who has struck a conciliatory tone on the remarks on social media. He posted: I want to say that we are really grateful to Ben Wallace for everything he has done for Ukraine. The United Kingdom has always supported us, they are one of our most important allies. They helped us with weapons (a lot of weapons) and provided humanitarian aid. Unfortunately, such words were said yesterday. But Ben Wallace did a lot for our country. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Ukrainian authorities have released more details about the overnight attack by Russia, saying defence forces downed 20 Russian attack drones and two cruise missiles in the attack that killed one and wounded at least four in Ukraine’s capital. “We have a successful air defense operation,” the air force spokesperson Yuriy Ignat told national television. “Twenty Shaheds were destroyed – all those flying were downed.” The 20 Iran-made Shahed attack drones were destroyed “mainly in the Kyiv region”, Ukraine’s air force said in a separate statement on Telegram. The drones had “entered the capital from different directions”, Kyiv’s military administration said on Telegram earlier, adding air defences had destroyed “about a dozen” in the city’s airspace. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has proposed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that he extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine in return for connecting a subsidiary of Russia’s agricultural bank to the Swift international payment system, sources have told Reuters. Russia has threatened to ditch the grain deal, which expires on Monday, because several demands to dispatch its own grain and fertiliser abroad have not been met. The last two ships traveling under the Black Sea agreement are currently loading cargoes at the Ukrainian port of Odesa ahead of the deadline. A key demand by Moscow is the reconnection of the Russian agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank to the Swift international payment network. It was cut off by the European Union in June 2022 over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. An EU spokesperson said in May the EU was not considering reinstating Russian banks. However, the EU is considering connecting to Swift a subsidiary of Rosselkhozbank to allow specifically for grain and fertiliser transactions, three sources familiar with discussions told Reuters on Wednesday. The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was, by the standards of international summits, an undiplomatic intervention. A clearly frustrated Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted that Nato allies were showing Ukraine disrespect, that they were discussing his country’s hopes of joining the military alliance without him. “It seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to Nato nor to make it a member of the alliance,” he wrote. The outburst was certainly last minute, coming less than an hour before Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and Nato other’s 29 leaders were due to sign off a final summit declaration on the topic. It turned out to be a communique that did not spell out a timeline by which Ukraine could join, nor a list of conditions it would have to meet, nor even extend an invitation to join at an unspecified future date once the war with Russia is over. In truth, the public lobbying was always going to be far too late: A senior Russian official has described Sergei Surovikin, the general who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine and hasn’t been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny, as “resting” and “not available”. Asked by Russian media outlet Shot if he had communicated with Surovikin, Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads the defence affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, said, “No. He is resting now. Not available.” Surovikin reportedly has close ties to Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Last month, US intelligence reportedly claimed that Surovikin had prior knowledge of the armed uprising led by Prigozhin, during which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov and moved on Moscow before cutting an amnesty deal. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has welcomed a “good result” from the Nato summit. His remark came after Britain’s defence secretary and the US national security adviser suggested Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it has received from the west, in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s complaints that his country has not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. In regular remarks made on Thursday night, Zelenskiy struck a positive note, saying, “for the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.” “Very importantly, during these two days of the Summit, we have put to rest any doubts and ambiguities about whether Ukraine will be in Nato. It will!” He added that he was “grateful to all those who have worked for unity in Vilnius”. A Russian drone strike on Kyiv killed one person and wounded at least four others, authorities said on Thursday, with AFP reporting that explosions were heard across the Ukrainian capital in the third night of attacks. “Tonight, a massive attack by Iranian drones took place,” Kyiv’s military administration said on Telegram. Iran-made Shahed explosive drones had “entered the capital from different directions,” it said, adding “about a dozen” had been downed in the city’s airspace. Falling debris was reported in five districts, it said, adding that a 19-year-old woman and 23-year-old man had been hospitalised with shrapnel wounds. Two people were wounded in Darnytsky district “as a result of falling debris,” Sergiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, wrote on Telegram. Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said the body of one resident was recovered when emergency services put out a fire in the capital’s historic Podil district. State emergency services later clarified that this was due to a domestic fire, and not the actions of the Russian Federation. This block and the live blog headline were edited to clarify that Ukraine’s state emergency services later stated the death in Kyiv had been caused by a domestic fire, and not as a result of enemy action. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: a Russian drone strike on Kyiv killed one person and wounded at least four others, authorities said on Thursday, with explosions heard across the Ukrainian capital in the third night of attacks. The attack came hours after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed renewed commitments from Nato and G7 leaders, saying, “We are returning home with a good result for our country” and that, “for the first time since independence, we have formed a security foundation for Ukraine on its way to Nato.” Other recent developments include: The US president, Joe Biden, concluded a Nato summit on Wednesday denouncing Russian president Vladimir Putin as “craven” and promising Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy full support even without membership in the military alliance. Biden, who has made unifying Nato countries a foreign policy priority, said Putin had badly underestimated their resolve. Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary said “people want to see a bit of gratitude” and Ukraine needed to put more emphasis on saying thank you for western help when he was asked about president Zelenskiy’s complaints on Tuesday that the country had not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. Wallace said Ukrainians’ haste to get all the help they could meant they did not always say they were grateful for the help received. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, distanced himself from Wallace’s comments, saying Zelenskiy has expressed gratitude for UK support. He highlighted that president Zelenskiy had expressed gratitude on multiple occasions, including his address to parliament earlier this year. “I know he and his people are grateful to the UK,” said Sunak. Zelenskiy said he “didn’t understand” Wallace’s comments. He also said “we could express our words of gratitude personally to the minister”. The G7 signed a declaration outlining support for Ukraine and help towards governance reforms needed for “Euro-Atlantic aspirations”. The member nations said they would provide security and economic support, including modern military equipment, across land, air, and sea, intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces in exchange for Ukraine committing to reforms “to underscore its commitments to democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and media freedoms”, “put its economy on a sustainable path” and strengthen “democratic civilian control of the military”. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Sweden’s Nato accession will not be put to Turkish parliament until autumn when it reopens. Speaking at a news conference after the Nato summit in Vilnius, Erdogan said that Sweden would provide a roadmap for Turkey regarding the steps to take against purported terrorism before the ratification. UN secretary-general António Guterres has proposed to Russian president Vladimir Putin that he extend a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine in return for connecting a subsidiary of Russia’s agricultural bank to the SWIFT international payment system, sources told Reuters. The last two ships traveling under the Black Sea agreement are currently loading cargoes at the Ukrainian port of Odesa ahead of the deadline. An 81-year-old man was killed after shelling in Kherson.

Early buzz is that this movie will be one of the blockbusters of the summer. One reason for the interest: the film is loaded with the philosophical questions J Robert Oppenheimer and his team faced while developing the first atomic bomb. Do nuclear weapons make us safer? Will they inspire an arms race that will push humanity into extinction? Is it possible this weapon will lead to the destruction of the world? The questions that the film’s director, Christopher Nolan, places at the center of Oppenheimer don’t feel theoretical to me. From 2012 to 2017 I worked as a nuclear missile operator in the US air force. During that time, I worked nearly 300 “alerts”, or shifts in underground launch control centers, where I oversaw maintenance, security and launch operations for 10 nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It may surprise you to hear that I watched a lot of movies while on alert. To be sure, the job of air force missile operators is often very busy. But it is also a 24/7/365 shift schedule. And on those late nights, weekends or holiday shifts when nothing was going on, my crew partners and I would turn to movies to get us through our shifts. It was here that I began to notice Hollywood’s love affair with nuclear weapons. Early on, Hollywood gave us a lot to chew on. Sidney Lumet’s 1964 film Fail Safe is as serious a commentary on the questions around nuclear deterrence as has ever been presented on the screen. The same year, Stanley Kubrick defined the absurdity of a society that uses a nuclear arsenal to achieve “peace” in his film Dr Strangelove. When these films were released, it had been less than 20 years since Americans dropped the first atomic bombs on Japan. America was just beginning its nuclear arms race with Russia and the nuclear conversation felt very much alive to the average American. But the American public grew weary of always being on high alert. Hollywood reflected this change as the meticulous films of the 60s began to give way to a new type of cold war thriller – one in which every villain seemed to speak with a Russian accent and wield some sort of vague existential nuclear threat that would be defeated by a red-blooded American. Some of these films, like 1983’s WarGames, were self-aware enough to work. But most existed on a spectrum ranging from Steven Seagal’s Under Siege to The Core – which is to say, mildly entertaining to so bad it’s somehow maybe almost good. As a result, in the decades before the release of Oppenheimer, the nuclear thriller had become an almost taboo genre in Hollywood. That’s a problem, because the nuclear threat never went away. If anything, it got worse. Today, the United States has about 400 nuclear tipped ICBMs, the ones I operated, ready for launch every single day. It also has a robust nuclear bomber program as well as nuclear-armed submarines. In total, the US owns approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads. What’s more, the air force is currently in the midst of developing a new ICBM nuclear delivery system, called Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). In 2020, the air force awarded a $13.3bn sole-source contract for GBSD to Northrop Grumman. The contract was awarded by default with no other competitors for the contract and little to no press coverage or public debate. When I was a 23-year-old missile operator in the air force, my commander once told me that a good day in nuclear missile operations is a quiet one. Most of the days in the five years I spent working in underground nuclear launch control silos were just that: quiet. But not every day in the history of the US air force nuclear missile program has been quiet. A “Broken Arrow” is defined as an unexpected event that results in the accidental launching, firing, detonating, theft or loss of a nuclear weapon. Since the creation of nuclear weapons, there have been 32 Broken Arrows. In the five years I served as a nuclear missile operator I performed targeting on dozens of active nuclear missiles. I commanded “major maintenance” operations like warhead swaps from one ICBM to another. We even pulled entire missiles out of the ground and replaced them with refurbished ones. And never once was I worried that I might have a Broken Arrow on my hands. The problem is that, while a good day in nuclear missile operations is a quiet one, the quiet days don’t lead to a reduction in the number of these weapons. That’s why we need engaging stories about nuclear weapons in our movie theaters. We need journalism that comprehensively unpacks this issue. In short, we need a public that is as engaged with nuclear weapons as they were during the cold war. Otherwise, it’s only on days when Vladimir Putin threatens the use of nuclear weapons, or the days that North Korea test launches its latest ICBM, that we begin to discuss the inherent dangers of a world that allows nuclear missiles to exist. And on those not-so-quiet days, it’s already too late. In May of 2022, while Nolan was in the midst of principal photography on Oppenheimer, I sat down for lunch in New York with Kai Bird, the co-author of American Prometheus, the book from which Oppenheimer is adapted. I asked Bird if he thought Nolan would do justice to the subject. Bird told me that Nolan shared a draft of the script with him and asked him to read it for any historical discrepancies. Bird told Nolan that almost everything looked accurate, but that the script put the casualty rate from the bomb used on Hiroshima at 70,000, a number much lower than the casualty count accepted by most historians. Nolan said that he knew this figure was low but that he had gone back and read the original transcripts from the Senate hearing and used the actual words from Oppenheimer’s mouth. Nolan’s attention to detail is what the nuclear conversation deserves. Oppenheimer sets the stage for a new conversation about nuclear weapons in Hollywood – one that doesn’t rely on overwrought cold war tropes. It’s a more difficult conversation because it’s one where, like Robert Oppenheimer, we have to come to terms with our own actions (or inactions) in order to make decisions about our future. Do we want to live in a world free from the threat of nuclear war? Or do we want to cover our eyes and throw the dice in a world with more than 14,000 nuclear warheads? Nolan isn’t afraid to ask these hard questions. I hope other film-makers follow his lead.

The review by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (Ipart) follows a NSW upper house inquiry last year that heard evidence about “significant consumer issues” involving embedded networks supplying electricity, hot water and gas. More than half a million people residing in apartment blocks, retirement villages, caravan parks and elsewhere pay for services on-sold by suppliers. Many sellers to embedded networks do not require authorisation from the Australian energy regulator and typically fall outside the remit of energy consumer law. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Soaring utility bills, particularly for energy, have added to the urgency to bolster consumer protections. Victoria, for instance, a year ago banned embedded power networks in new unit blocks, enacting a 2018 promise. Ipart noted the inquiry had heard one witness received a hot water bill for $2,000 for a nine-month period while a neighbour was charged $9,700 over a 14-month stint. “Customers in embedded networks need protections from unreasonably high prices,” tribunal member Sandra Gamble said in a statement. “Most consumers within embedded networks are locked into a contract with the supplier at their site,” she said. “There are few limits on the prices that they can be charged and they are unable to shop around for a better deal.” Power bills for NSW residential customers rose by between 20% and 25% from 1 July based on default market offers, an increase in line with other states. However, more embedded network customers should be able to have access to such offers, the upper house inquiry found. The previous Coalition state government accepted most of the inquiry’s recommendations, including initiating an Ipart review into whether a maximum price below the default market offer price was required for embedded electricity networks. It also launched an embedded network action plan just before the March state election. The Minns Labor government plans to consider its options after the Ipart review. Ipart will release consultation papers for customers and industry on Tuesday, seeking their views on how price caps should be set and whether there are clear benefits of hot and chilled water embedded networks to justify their construction in the future. Submissions are due by 11 September, with stakeholders invited to an online workshop planned for 21 September. Ipart will release a draft report by November."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
