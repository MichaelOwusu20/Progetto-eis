It isn’t hard. Saying “you are special” or words to that effect, usually does the trick. It helps to say it in the White House, within earshot of the British press corps. Westminster hacks and Downing Street aides, most of whom are unhealthily obsessed with US politics, love a Washington summit for the same reason that Harry Potter fans queue to visit the Warner Bros studio in Watford. Standing on the stage where the magic happens is its own reward. That makes Rishi Sunak a cheap date for Joe Biden at this week’s summit. The US president can bestow the normal diplomatic courtesies, while conceding nothing of strategic substance. Downing Street then tells friendly journalists that the two men bonded over baseball, or some other shared cultural enthusiasm, or that their wives did. The prime minister flies home with burnished credentials as the leader of a very important country indeed. The bar for summit success has been set low. It helps that the prime minister isn’t Boris Johnson or Liz Truss, whose bellicose Brexit methods sabotaged transatlantic relations. By negotiating the Windsor framework, easing frictions around Northern Ireland, Sunak atoned for the offence that Biden summarised crudely, but fairly, as “screwing around” with the Good Friday agreement. Sunak’s mission to Washington is also mercifully free of unrealistic speculation about a US-UK free-trade deal. This was an obsession for Brexit enthusiasts. Opening new vistas of transatlantic commerce was meant to outweigh any downside to withdrawal from the European single market. The economics of that proposition never added up, but it was a comfort to Eurosceptics, whose paranoia about London’s submission to Brussels fed a delusion of parity with Washington. Donald Trump nurtured that fantasy. His successor has kiboshed it. Biden’s economic strategy is based around lavish government support for domestic industries, tax breaks for investment and supply chains rerouted to assert US strategic primacy. That buries the model of globalisation that Brexit ideologues had in mind when mapping their buccaneering adventures on the high seas of international trade. Sunak is a disciple of the small-state, anti-intervention school of conservatism. He finds Bidenomics perplexing for that reason alone. But it also highlights the terrible error of quitting the continental bloc in which Britain, by pooling resources with European partners, had a chance of keeping pace with the Americans. If economic competition in the years ahead is going to be an arms race of industrial subsidy, the UK will be outgunned by Brussels and Washington. The counterclaim by keepers of the Brexit faith is that Britain’s isolation is really an advantage, permitting agility and innovation where Europe is staid and sclerotic. A nimbly sovereign nation might lead the way in new sectors. Hence Downing Street has hyped Sunak’s interest in AI ahead of the Washington trip. The prime minister has been consulting tech bosses about awesome new computing powers coming on stream. He has been pondering how best to manage the development of machines that might, within years, rival nuclear weapons in their capacity to cause harm in the wrong hands. He has concluded that Britain can lead the world in this field, and that London should be the capital of global AI governance. He will raise all of this with President Biden, we are told. The idea of an international AI regulator – equivalent to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna – is perfectly sensible. London could make a respectable bid to host it. But so could other cities. Either way, it won’t be decided over coffee on Wednesday night. Visiting leaders “raise” all sorts of things with their hosts. It is a diplomatic euphemism for questions brought to the table with no expectation of answers. Things are “raised” for the benefit of an audience back home, so the leader who doesn’t really set the agenda can claim to have put some item on it. Under a friendly (or credulous) media lens, the prime minister is thus projected from the margins of international influence into the centre. Something similar happened last week, when Sunak attended a summit of the European Political Community (EPC) in Moldova. The EPC was first convened last year by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is envisaged as a forum where EU and non-EU heads of government can discuss pan-continental issues. That is no substitute for the seat (and the veto) that Britain used to have at European Council summits, but it is better than nothing. Ukraine was the focus of discussions in Moldova. Except, that is, when Sunak raised the topic of illegal migration. His unilateral digression was then spun by Downing Street as Britain “taking the lead” on a vital issue; putting it “at the top of the international agenda”. This fiction was transmitted by various UK media outlets, as if all of Europe’s leaders huddled round their British counterpart while he laid down the law on small boats crossing the Channel. Preposterously, GB News even reported it as a “migration meeting”. At least Sunak was invited to Moldova. There had been no British representation the previous week at a meeting in Sweden of the EU-US Trade and Technology Council. This, too, is a relatively new institution. It was launched in June 2021 by Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, to coordinate policy on “global trade and technology” between Washington and Brussels. The most recent gathering discussed a code of conduct for AI development. That is exactly the conversation Sunak thinks should be happening in London. But if Americans and Europeans are already having it somewhere else, why should they move it? What does Britain offer for just a seat in the room? To raise the question is not to deny that a UK prime minister has clout. There is heft in the office of the leader of a G7 economy, with a nuclear arsenal and a permanent seat on the UN security council. Biden makes time for Sunak because the relationship between the two countries is important. When it comes to defence and security cooperation, it is one of the sturdiest alliances in the world. But friendship is not the same as influence. It is a bald strategic fact that Brexit makes a British prime minister less useful to Washington. Without leverage in Brussels, Sunak is not in a position to broker deals with Biden. Instead, he pays tribute. That can be spun into something special for the parochial Westminster audience that doesn’t want to admit that Britain is smaller outside the EU. The message will get through eventually. There are only so many angles for making the margins look like the centre. There is only so long Britain can fake being a global power if it isn’t a player in Europe.

The All England Club has teamed up with tech group IBM to offer AI-generated audio commentary and captions in its online highlights videos. The service will be available on the Wimbledon app and website and will be separate to the BBC’s coverage for the 3 July-16 July tournament. It will use IBM’s watsonx AI platform, which has been trained in the “unique language of tennis” with the help of the All England Club. The club already uses IBM’s AI technology to provide features such as its player power index, which analyses player performance. The coverage will also include AI-powered analysis of singles draws, examining how favourable a player’s path to the final might be. “This new insight will help tennis fans to uncover anomalies and potential surprises in the singles draw, which would not be apparent by looking only at the players’ ranking,” said IBM. Data, such as tracking data for the ball, tracking data for the players and the type of shots the players make from different parts of the court, is collected from a variety of sources around the court. It will then be fed into IBM’s platform, where it will be processed by the company’s AI models before ultimately being fed to a chatbot-style system that produces natural language commentary, specifically fine-tuned in the language of tennis and Wimbledon. That commentary can also be handed on to a second text-to-speech AI to turn it into audio commentary in near-real-time. IBM said the move was a step towards generating AI commentary on full matches. The European broadcasting union announced this month that the cloned voice of the commentator Hannah England will be used to provide commentary for the European Athletics Championships. England’s voice will be used to replicate the content of the event’s live blog for commentary on the European Athletics YouTube channel. Watson, IBM’s branding for its suite of AI tools, made headlines more than a decade ago for playing – and winning – a game of the American TV show Jeopardy!, where contestants answer general knowledge questions with peculiar phrasings. At the time, the system was groundbreaking for its ability to understand spoken queries including “Vedic, dating back at least 4,000 years, is the earliest dialect of this classical language of India”, and to buzz and respond in real time with the correct answer – in this case, “What is Sanskrit?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T20:10:08Z","webTitle":"Walter Murgatroyd obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My father, Walter Murgatroyd, who has died aged 101, worked for many years as a researcher in the field of civilian nuclear engineering before becoming disillusioned with the industry’s inability to properly deal with its waste. He then switched to working on thermal power, exploring how to use energy more efficiently and to generate it in new ways. Walter was born in Bradford to Harry, who worked in textile manufacturing, and Martha (nee Strachan), a housewife. He was educated at Blackpool grammar school, after which the second world war interrupted his engineering studies at Cambridge University; he was sent to work on designing engines for fighter jets, first with Hawker Siddeley and then with Rolls-Royce. After the war Walter resumed his studies, staying on at Cambridge to research and design pumps for liquid metals, using electromagnetism rather than moving parts in contact with the dangerous and corrosive fluids. In austerity Britain he required great ingenuity to obtain the necessary materials and craftsmanship for his work. In 1954 he joined the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment as principal scientific officer, responsible for assessment of the various types of nuclear reactor then in development and tasked with working out what resources would be needed. Two years later he was appointed head of nuclear engineering at Queen Mary College in east London (now Queen Mary University of London) – the first such chair in Europe. While there he helped to build an experimental reactor in the Lea valley in London on what many years later was to become part of the 2012 Olympic park. When work began on the site, no trace was found of any radiation, making it one of the safest parts of the otherwise heavily polluted area. By 1968 he had become frustrated with the politics and vested interests of nuclear power generation, in particular the lack of progress on waste disposal, and decided to move away from the sector by becoming chair in thermal power at Imperial College London. There he foresaw the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, recognising the need to reduce demand for energy – whether by curtailing economic growth, or by using energy more efficiently. He remained at Imperial College until retirement in the early 1980s, and over that period was often called on (via the United Nations or British Council) to advise on energy matters abroad. He was also asked to provide expertise to the energy select committee of the House of Commons. Walter was a good judge of character, and always knew the right questions to ask. Music was hugely important to him, and he could also be great fun. His strong regard for truth and personal integrity gained him wide respect, though it did not always make life easy. He married Denise Schlumberger in 1952; she died in 2014, and their son Alan died in a car crash in 1980. Walter is survived by two other children, Linda and Francis, and three grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T18:33:26Z","webTitle":"US will soon need to deter two major nuclear powers for first time, White House says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","fields":{"bodyText":"Within a decade, the US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned, pointing to the Russian arsenal that is increasingly being brandished by Moscow and an expanding Chinese stockpile. The president’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. It warns that threat could grow as Russian forces continue to suffer defeats on the battlefield. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint says. Its publication was scheduled in the spring but was postponed because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has threatened to use “all means” to defend Russian territory, in which he included Crimea, annexed in 2014, and four Ukrainian regions he now claims. The NSS pledges US support for Ukrainian resistance would not be affected by such threats. “The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons,” the document says. In a foreword, Biden makes a distinction between the types of threats posed by Moscow and Beijing. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown,” the president writes. He describes China, on the other hand as “the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective”. The policy document portrays Beijing as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge”. “The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly,” it says. China has an estimated 350 nuclear warheads, according to an assessment by the Federation of American Scientists, compared with 5,977 in Russia’s stockpile, against the US inventory of 5,428. However, the Pentagon believes the Chinese force will grow to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030, making it a third major nuclear power. Under the last remaining major arms control agreement in place, the New Start treaty, the US and Russia observe a ceiling of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, referring to those warheads mounted on land or sea-launched missiles, or ready for loading on to long-range bombers. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, expressed concern over whether the new language in the strategy document could herald a rethink about the size of the US arsenal. “If we have to worry about two near-peer nuclear rivals by the year 2030, what does that mean for the number of targets in Russia and China that the president believes we need to hold at risk to deter those nuclear threats? And how does that affect that total number of strategic nuclear weapons the United States and the president believes he needs to deploy?” Kimball asked. “They’re basically looking at issues and questions that could lead to a larger number calculation,” he said, adding: “It’s not hard science. It could be more; it could be less. I would argue that even if China has twice the number of nuclear weapons, we still can and should reduce the total number of strategic nuclear weapons because what we have is excessive of any reasonable calculation of what it takes to deter a nuclear attack.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-08T14:00:03Z","webTitle":"US warns Australia against joining treaty banning nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/09/us-warns-australia-against-joining-treaty-banning-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"bodyText":"The US has warned Australia against joining a landmark treaty banning nuclear weapons, saying the agreement could hamper defence arrangements between the US and its allies. But New Zealand said it was “pleased to observe a positive shift” in Australia’s position in a United Nations vote and “would, of course, welcome any new ratifications as an important step to achieving a nuclear weapon-free world”. The comments follow the Albanese government shifting Australia’s voting position on the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to “abstain” after five years of blanket opposition by the Coalition government. The relatively new treaty imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. But so far it has been shunned by all of the nuclear weapons states and many of their allies. The US embassy in Canberra said the treaty “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup That is a reference to Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia – the so-called “nuclear umbrella” – even though Australia does not have any of its own atomic weapons. The embassy said the treaty also risked “reinforcing divisions” within the international community. “While the United States understands and shares the desire to advance nuclear disarmament goals, we do not support the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons,” a spokesperson for the US embassy told Guardian Australia. “The United States does not believe that progress toward nuclear disarmament can be decoupled from the prevailing security threats in today’s world.” The comments are a sign of the pushback Australia faces from its top security ally if it gets closer to signing and ratifying the treaty – although that still seems distant. New Zealand said it welcomed “constructive developments in Australia’s approach” to the treaty, including the shift from opposing a NZ-backed resolution on the topic at the UN general assembly first committee last month. New Zealand’s minister for disarmament and arms control, Phil Twyford, has met with Australian representatives. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said New Zealand continued to urge all countries that were not yet a party to the treaty to sign and ratify it “at the earliest opportunity”, while acknowledging it was “for Australia to determine its position”. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been involved in advocacy against nuclear weapons and has described them as “the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created”. Albanese moved the motion at Labor’s 2018 national conference backing the TPNW, saying the task would not be easy or simple but it would be “just”. The treaty now has 91 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it entered into force last year. Labor’s 2021 national platform committed the party to signing and ratifying the treaty “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. These conditions suggest the barriers to actually joining the treaty may still be high. But campaigners have welcomed Albanese’s comments over the weekend that characterised the very existence of nuclear weapons as a security threat, rather than espousing deterrence. The prime minister told the Australian newspaper that the threat by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to use tactical nuclear weapons “has reminded the world that the existence of nuclear weapons is a threat to global security and the norms we had come to take for granted”. Gem Romuld, the Australia director of the Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said that framing was notable. “In contrast to the previous government, prime minister Albanese clearly understands that nuclear weapons undermine global security, and that pursuing disarmament is of paramount importance,” Romuld said. “It’s no surprise the US doesn’t want Australia to join the ban treaty but it will have to respect our right to take a humanitarian stance against these weapons.” Romuld raised concerns that the plans for hosting of US B-52 aircraft in Australia “could escalate regional tensions or involve nuclear weapons, which Australia has committed not to ‘station’ under the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone”. Indonesia’s ambassador, Siswo Pramono, said Australia’s positive shift on the treaty would “give encouragement to others to believe that we are on the right path” in seeking a world free of nuclear weapons. Australia continues to pursue closer security and defence cooperation with the US, including plans to acquire nuclear-powered but conventionally armed submarines under the Aukus agreement, which also includes the UK. The defence minister, Richard Marles, told the Submarine Institute conference in Canberra on Tuesday that Australia must “make sure that we are able to be good nuclear stewards from cradle to grave” to secure international acceptance of Aukus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/sep/06/aryna-sabalenka-races-past-zheng-qinwen-to-reach-us-open-semi-final","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-06T22:43:38Z","webTitle":"US Open: Sabalenka powers past Zheng, Medvedev outlasts Rublev in heat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/06/aryna-sabalenka-races-past-zheng-qinwen-to-reach-us-open-semi-final","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/sep/06/aryna-sabalenka-races-past-zheng-qinwen-to-reach-us-open-semi-final","fields":{"bodyText":"At the beginning of this year, while she was still just one player in a vast field of challengers, Aryna Sabalenka made her primary goal for the season clear. The Belarusian rarely does things by half measures and so she did not merely want to win her first grand slam tournament – she intended to catch Iga Swiatek and overtake her as the world No 1. That goal may have finally been realised, but the work does not stop. With the No 1 ranking from next week secured, Sabalenka continued to march through the US Open draw as she overpowered Zheng Qinwen of China 6-1, 6-4 to return to the semi-finals for the third consecutive year. In the men’s draw, Daniil Medvedev survived the suffocating heat and humidity as he returned to the semi-final with a convincing 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 win over Andrey Rublev. It is the fourth time in the last five years that Medvedev, the 2021 champion, has reached the semi-finals in New York. During a tough three sets, which were played out in brutal conditions, Medvedev used an inhaler on-court for the second successive match. He expressed his frustration at continuing to play in such tough conditions, with the tournament organisers only closing the roof halfway. “One player is going to die. And they’re going to see,” he said. Having struggled earlier in her career with a significant mental block in the major tournaments, Sabalenka has become the most reliable grand slam performer in the sport with remarkable consistency at the biggest events. The 25-year-old has reached the semi-finals of five consecutive grand slams, now becoming the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to reach the semi-finals of all four majors in a year. “I’m super-proud of myself and my team that we have been able to adjust to different conditions, different courts,” she said. “We were able to bring this consistency in my game.” Her opponent, Zheng, is one of the most talented young players in the game. The 20-year-old is armed with an excellent first serve, one of the heaviest forehands in the game and she is a great athlete. Yet against Sabalenka’s immense power, weight of shot and growing intelligence, Zheng’s game looked underpowered. The Belarusian served so brilliantly, losing just nine return points in the entire match, that by the second set Zheng felt compelled to return serve from the back fence, a tactic more often seen on the ATP Tour. It did little to stop Sabalenka from closing out another great performance without issue. This has been an incredible season for Sabalenka, who clinched her first grand slam at the Australian Open, and she has made dramatic improvements to her game. Where she was once emotional, rash and thoughtless on the court, Sabalenka has moulded herself into a calm and smart player capable of harnessing her extreme power with high percentage, sustainable tennis that she has replicated all year. Yet this year has also, at times, been crushing. For all of her success, she could have achieved even more. She held match point and a 5-2 third-set lead against Karolina Muchova in their French Open semi-final before completely crumbling. Then, in the semi-finals of Wimbledon, she led Ons Jabeur 7-6 (5), 4-2 before losing four games in a row, and eventually the match. “I just have a really strong belief that all those tough matches that I lost will help me in the future in tough matches, tough battles,” she said. “I’m just learning and I’m just getting more experience and getting stronger. It’s been tough,” she said. It has been clear that the pressure of the No 1 ranking, which was on the line at both tournaments, weighed heavily on her in those matches and the Australian Open triumph this year remains the only time she has won a grand slam semi-final. Thus, one of the most important questions in the final days of the US Open will be whether Sabalenka, having reached her ultimate goal, will be able to play with a level of freedom that will only make her more dangerous. Meanwhile, Naomi Osaka said that she plans to make her return to professional tennis in January ahead of the Australian Open after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, two months ago. Osaka, a four-time grand slam champion and former No 1, returned to the US Open in order to speak on a mental health panel alongside Michael Phelps."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-16T14:59:28Z","webTitle":"‘We love life – but death loves us more’: the pain and power of Iraqi music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/may/16/iraqi-music-20-years-since-iraq-war","fields":{"bodyText":"‘I heard an American Humvee approaching as soldiers were patrolling our area in Al-Qa’im, close to the Syrian border.” The Iraqi music producer UsFoxx is recalling a childhood memory, from 2004, during the Iraq war. “Through the open windows I heard this infectious beat, which I later learned was 50 Cent’s In Da Club. My jaw dropped.” This unexpected but inspiring encounter was the first step of UsFoxx’s journey to becoming one of the many prolific producers and beatmakers in Baghdad today. The position of music in Iraqi culture was badly distorted after the 2003 American-led invasion which silenced many voices or stunted their evolution, but 20 years later a new generation of eclectic artists has emerged – particularly in the aftermath of the political upheaval of the 2019-21 Tishreen uprising protests – with work spanning rap, techno, experimental music, jazz and beyond. Speaking from a newly setup studio in Baghdad, UsFoxx is eager to share his music with me, “from house to Afrobeats; old school to new school trap”. Having moved from Iraq to India after Islamic State attacks in 2015, then weathered Covid lockdowns in 2020 in Iraq after he had returned, music was an outlet for his adventurous ear. Like many of his contemporaries, UsFoxx is self-taught in music production, and the internet and satellite dishes allowed after a ban under the Saddam Hussein regime meant that his generation could absorb new influences and create new aesthetics. He made the beat for 2022’s Iraq Cypher which brought together sharp and witty socio-cultural lyricism from nine stellar Iraqi rappers – Kira The Blurryface, Armando Rap, Nayomi, Disser, KC Hamada, AlRong, Genesis, Odd Khalid and El Seen – over a drill-adjacent beat, and London-based Saudi DJ Nooriyah has played UsFoxx’s tracks in her hugely popular Boiler Room set last December. But he’s still melancholy amid the success: “Iraqi people have suffered so much untreated trauma – we Iraqis survive, we love life, although death loves us more,” UsFoxx says with a sigh. Over in Basra, beatmaker Hafs is a similarly melancholic figure, with a sound fluttering between ambient pop, Afrobeats and trip-hop – his fragility and depth of emotion in contrast to the prevailing hypermasculinity in the war-torn country. He explains his motivation: “When I became depressed it was because of things that happened to me in the past, and our present is rooted in the past. So I became more aware that when I make music, I can channel my feelings to the listeners: my music can make them feel the sadness or happiness that I feel.” Hafs started his career almost 10 years ago in rap battles on online forums, and refined his creativity into his hybrid sound, coupled with a philosophical and sentimental approach. “When someone hurts me, I don’t reply immediately – I relax and leave it, then make music and write about that pain,” he says with a wry smile. His single Kawabis (meaning nightmares in Arabic) was drawn from a harrowing moment – “I had a nightmare about having a nightmare. I could not touch myself and had so much pain from life” – and incorporates sounds and beats found on the internet, “softening the harshness” of the maazoufeh rhythm. In Basra there are no venues to perform in, due to the conservative nature of society, so the only places in which to perform non-classical styles of music are public parks. So Hafs has released a large number of albums via YouTube, the chief medium for releasing music in Iraq. More recently he has put out work on the indie record label Shlonak Records, founded by Canada-based Iraqi rapper and professor Narcy, who established it to aid releases in a country where Spotify only arrived in 2021 and the physical production of music relies on piracy. Producer Abdulisms, a principal voice on the Iraqi music scene in London and another vital part of Shlonak Records, explains the logistical barriers in Iraq: “Most tracks are distributed on Telegram channels; there’s often no way of getting MP3s apart from ripping them off YouTube.” The other issue is that PayPal is not available there. But Covid lockdowns deepened the ties between musicians in Iraq and around the world. Unable to collaborate with people in London, Abdulisms joined Iraq-A-Fella Radio, a show started by Mocity, a Delhi-based Iraqi label owner and DJ, exploring many branches of sonic heritage, “from chobi to chalghi, to more nostalgic tunes, presenting Iraqi female singers, rappers and football anthems,” Abdulisms says. UsFoxx was also involved, “feeding us all the tracks and information from Iraq. Iraq-A-Fella started as heart surgery” – something to heal its wounded listeners – “and took on a life of its own. It was mad!” Meanwhile, London-based British-Iraqi artist manager Nazar Risafi has been working with Iraqi duo Tribe of Monsters, who are based in Amman, Jordan. Their trailblazing single Cypher took the voice of legendary Iraqi singer Sajda Obeid and blended it with Cardi B and Gucci Mane, spiced up with a trip-hop groove and Iraqi percussion and interwoven with samples of Arabic instruments such as the oud and nay. Risafi explains that the Tishreen uprising, which lasted almost two years and saw a mass movement of Iraqi youth take to the streets demanding a new homeland and Iraqi identity beyond sectarianism, had a huge effect. “We started seeing rap artists online and on the streets, rapping about the revolution,” he says. “From there people started to connect – in 2020 you saw collaborations between artists in Iraq with artists outside Iraq.” Rapping about state corruption as well as the insidious effects of sectarianism, economic downturn, unemployment and international interference in Iraq, the music is both anti-establishment and anti-interventionist. The first Tribe of Monsters single Dheil A’waj (Crooked Tail) meticulously described the daily struggles young people faced on the streets during the uprising, followed by Albo October, which referenced the protests where more than 700 protesters were killed and more than 17,000 injured. “October boys, we salute you, the Iraqi flag flies high above us and all the corrupt politicians are beneath our feet,” Ameer Shamy raps. The duo has been preparing a compilation album titled Made in Iraq, bringing together the cream of the Iraqi rap scene. There are female rappers too – at least in the diaspora – such as Nayomi or Psi.ko, but Iraqi music is not all about electronic music and rap. In the US, Iraqi-American jazz trumpeter and musician Amir ElSaffar has been touring with the Two Rivers Ensemble; a sextet of international and south west Asian musicians making innovative strides between American jazz and the maqam modal system which ElSaffar explains is “a repertoire of melodies that are sung to poetry and practised in Iraq for hundreds of years, going back to the Abbasid era [750 to AD1258]”. For him, playing this specifically Iraqi music is a political gesture, reminding listeners of how the country endures. “I’m glad that some people are remembering and acknowledging the horrors, but it seems like [most of] the world has moved on,” he says. “We still need to think about the impact on ordinary Iraqis.” He has just returned from a visit to Iraq for the first time in 20 years, and was wowed by a 40-strong ensemble of musicians all under the age of 35. “I was getting tears in my eyes, because they were playing from memory and putting their hearts into it in a very intimate way.” Nadin Al Khalidi is an Iraqi multi-instrumentalist and singer for the Sweden based group Tarabband who plays another style altogether: veering between the ecstatic Arab urban music of tarab and western folk and classical arrangements, Al Khalidi adds a touch of Iraqi chobi (an upbeat folkloric rhythm local to Iraq), jazz and north African rhythms. Growing up in an artistic household, with weekly visits to the Baghdad Opera House, she recalls sirens and bombs soundtracking her childhood during the Gulf war. After that, she says, “there were the sanctions on Iraq; there was the dictatorship and constant spying, and then the invasion.” The Iraq war in 2001 forced Al Khalidi and her sister to flee as refugees – she speaks to me from her home office in Malmö. She had been taught to play the violin at The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad as a child, but had to abandon her musical education due to the wars. Upon arriving in Sweden Al Khalidi worked in a pub, where the Serbian owner encouraged her to sing in Arabic. “I had no responsibilities; my parents had died and I was eager to live. I dreamed of playing the guitar and there I was, playing the music that I loved for the first time, with a PA system and a mic.” Within a week, the Malmö Symphony Orchestra asked her to take part in a project sharing Arabic folk music, where she met her eventual Tarabband collaborator Gabriel Hermanson. For the 2022 album Yekhaf (I Intimidate Him) she worked with an Egyptian poet, Hazem Wefy, “who helped me understand how I’m writing from personal experiences. The album is about encounters with fellow Iraqis, Arabic-speakers and kindred spirits, the young generation of Iraqis demonstrating on the streets,” and about “new friendships and support systems created en route.” One of the most touching songs is Sedra, dedicated to a refugee girl from Mosul who Al Khalidi met during a performance in 2018. “She kept interrupting me as I was singing in Arabic. Later she told me that she saw the execution of both her parents by IS. She asked me to sing about her – and this song is for her.” Farther south in Europe, the experimental, innovative work of Khyam Allami, a Berlin-based British-Iraqi multi-instrumentalist, researcher and founder of the label Nawa Recordings, draws from the past to look into the future. Allami studied oud in London and engaged with Iraqi maqam which are the basis for his debut album, Resonance/Dissonance, “but I always wanted to understand what makes an Iraqi song and what’s the thumbprint carried within,” he says. “We can forge new ideas and a new future by learning from the past, but that doesn’t necessarily mean reviving the past or taking it literally. What I’ve been trying to get at is the essence of something.” He says he’s been inspired by African American artists, who, “whether it’s hip-hop, jazz, or other artistic and musical forms, have had to define their own future based on their past, in a way that’s owned and committed.” Allami is now delving into 9th and 10th century Arabic manuscripts by Iraqi polymaths Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, and how they relate to today’s culture. The deep desire for Iraqis such as UsFoxx and Hafs to connect with the outside world is met, then, with a similar desire from the Iraqi diaspora to connect with their homeland – which needs to be handled sensitively. Allami collaborated with the National Youth Orchestra of Iraq a few years ago – “It was the first time that I’d been able to connect with this generation who had lived through these catastrophes” – and while studying in Cairo, met a young man “whose entire family was killed in an air raid; that generation has a look in their eye that tells us that we haven’t lived what they’ve lived through. But I’ve learned that we need to think about our contributions regardless of our positions.” What he contributes, he says, is “allowing others to do a different kind of work”. ElSaffar also often thinks about how he can “connect the jazz improv scene to that in Iraq”, and for Al Khalidi it is a similar story: “I would love to perform in Iraq with Tarabband, but I would come back home to Sweden”. Every Iraqi has a story of why they had to leave, Abdulisms explains: “The question of returning is far too complex and intersects with a lot of power [structures].” Despite the challenges, Iraqi musicians are asserting the longstanding plurality of their country’s identity and adding to the remarkably eclectic fabric of its music. It seems that even the Iraqi government is catching up: prime minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani recently gave the green light for works to resume on Baghdad’s Opera House. One of the oldest symphony orchestras in the world can once again become a space nurturing culture and creativity – qualities that are clearly in abundant supply in Iraq."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T15:06:59Z","webTitle":"Cheltenham Festival day three tips: Flooring Porter can power to hat-trick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-day-three-tips-flooring-porter-can-power-to-hat-trick","fields":{"bodyText":"Paisley Park and Flooring Porter, the winners from three of the last four seasons, are both in the field for the Stayers’ Hurdle at Cheltenham on Thursday and while the former would be a hugely popular winner, Gavin Cromwell’s eight-year-old looks the better bet at around 6-1 to complete a hat-trick in the day’s feature event. Flooring Porter (3.30) has failed to score in three starts since his two-and-three-quarter length success 12 months ago, but he was winless in three before that victory too and should perhaps have set a stronger clip when only fourth behind Home By The Lee, another of Thursday’s rivals, at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting. Danny Mullins knows exactly what is required around three miles at Cheltenham, however, and while the six-year-old Teahupoo is a live contender for the next generation of stayers, his best form is on heavy ground and he was a disappointment on his only previous start at the Festival. Cheltenham 1.30 The latest big banker for the Irish and Mighty Potter’s form is very difficult to fault. He was sent straight into Grade One company after winning a beginners’ race in November and has scored decisively in two top-level races since, including a defeat of Gaillard Du Mesnil, Tuesday’s National Hunt Chase winner, at Fairyhouse in December. His latest victory at the Dublin Racing Festival was backed up by a strong time and Gordon Elliott’s six-year-old surely has better still to come. Cheltenham 2.10 The qualifier for this race at Haydock in February was run in a strong time on similar ground, and the runner-up, The Changing Man, lines up for the Final off just a 2lb higher mark. He is more exposed than some of his rivals but also admirably consistent, having finished first or second in his last six starts, and is a very tempting each-way option at around 20-1. Cheltenham 2.50 The aura of invincibility that surrounded Shishkin in the first three seasons of his career vanished in last year’s Champion Chase, but he returned to something close to peak form when stepped up in trip at Ascot last month. At his best, he is the better part of a stone clear on ratings and a repeat of his latest performance should be more than enough. Cheltenham 4.10 It goes against the grain to back a short-priced favourite in a 24-runner Festival handicap, but Emmet Mullins, the trainer of So Scottish, took this race with a similar type in The Shunter two years ago and his claims are impossible to ignore. The six-year-old made short work of his first two starts over fences before finishing second at Ascot on his handicap debut over an inadequate trip and should improve significantly for the return to two-and-a-half miles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/04/spain-alberto-nunez-feijoo-faces-fine-balancing-act-to-deal-with-far-right-vox","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T09:35:06Z","webTitle":"Will ‘safe pair of hands’ Feijóo deal with far-right Vox and take power in Spain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/04/spain-alberto-nunez-feijoo-faces-fine-balancing-act-to-deal-with-far-right-vox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/04/spain-alberto-nunez-feijoo-faces-fine-balancing-act-to-deal-with-far-right-vox","fields":{"bodyText":"By 11pm last Sunday, it was clear that Spain’s opposition conservative People’s party (PP) had comprehensively routed the ruling socialists in the regional and municipal elections that had followed two weeks of ugly and unedifying campaigning. The PP had snatched no fewer than six regions and some of Spain’s biggest cities from the socialists’ grasp, much to the delight of the supporters who had descended, flag-waving and jubilant, on the conservatives’ HQ on Génova Street in central Madrid. Despite the boisterous cheering from outside, however, one person who had arrived at Génova three hours earlier was not punching the air, roaring in triumph or demanding high-fives from underlings. Then again, few who know Alberto Núñez Feijóo would expect such emotional incontinence from the man who assumed the PP leadership just over a year ago. “He’s a very restrained person when it comes to his personal reactions,” says a veteran adviser who was with Feijóo on Sunday night. “He doesn’t let himself get down when things don’t go well and he isn’t exultant when things go the way he wants them to. I’ve been with him through a lot of triumphs and I’ve never seen him go over the top about them.” Feijóo’s inner circle believes it is precisely those qualities of equanimity and moderation that have helped the 61-year-old reconfigure the PP after a turbulent few years and made him the favourite to win the snap general election announced by Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, hours after his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) was humbled at the polls. Unlike his erratic, avowedly rightwing predecessor, Pablo Casado, who dragged the PP away from the centre ground in an unsuccessful effort to stop its voters being seduced by the far-right Vox party, Feijóo is a fixture of the more progressive wing of the centre-right. So much so, in fact, that he has even admitted voting for the PSOE’s Felipe González in the 1982 election that marked the end of Spain’s post-Franco transition to democracy. Much has been made of his calm, understated demeanour – especially in contrast to the slick, telegenic and sometimes unpredictable charms of Sánchez. Feijóo’s camp readily acknowledges that he is a reflective individual who could be viewed as very much a product of his home region of Galicia, of which he was president between 2009 and last year. According to the ancient but enduring cliche, Galicians are very, very difficult to read. The seasoned adviser – who mentions the old joke about how hard it can be to determine whether a Galician is going up the stairs or coming down them – argues Feijóo is too thoughtful to fit naturally into a world of Twitter, soundbites and gotchas. “He’s not comfortable with that … and he doesn’t think politics is a tweet,” they note, approvingly. And yet his team also likes to position Feijóo as something of a modern outlier within his own very traditional, affluent party: a man from very humble beginnings who helped his grandparents in their small shop, worked to support his family when his father lost his job, and who became a father himself at the age of 55 after meeting a woman who already had a child from a previous relationship. Despite his low-key image, Feijóo has not always managed to avoid scandal. The publication 10 years ago of photographs showing him on holiday in the mid-1990s with a friend who was later convicted of drug trafficking led to calls for him to step down as Galicia’s president. But he survived the affair, insisting he had had no reason to suspect his friend, Marcial Dorado, was involved in anything illegal, and claiming he had broken off contact with Dorado as soon as he was charged with criminal offences. A decade on, the epithet most readily associated with Feijóo is “safe pair of hands” – a description that was also sometimes applied to Mariano Rajoy, a fellow Galician who was PP prime minister between 2011 and 2018, when Sánchez used a vote of no confidence to turf his corruption-mired administration out of office. “Feijóo’s advantage is that he’s a steady pair of hands,” says Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political consultancy Teneo. “That’s what he is and that’s what he was in Galicia. He’s been able to unite the party and post a very good result in the elections – and power is a very good glue for political parties.” Unlike Casado, he adds, Feijóo is not a polarising figure within his own party, nor for the electorate. “He can definitely appeal to centre-right voters, but even some people who have gone to Vox might be attracted to support Feijóo.” The problem is that the far-right party appears to hold Feijóo’s future in its hands. Strong as the PP’s showing was last Sunday, no poll shows the party winning anything like enough seats in July to be able to govern on its own. The PP will also need to rely on deals with Vox to help it govern many of the regions it has just won. But any PP-Vox regional coalition governments would come at a cost as they would serve to confirm Sánchez’s argument that the conservatives are happy to ally themselves with the far right for the sake of power. The prime minister is hoping the spectre of Vox in government will help mobilise leftwing and centrist voters on a massive scale. This week, he said Spain was not immune to the political trends that swept Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro to power. He said Spaniards would have to decide whether they want a prime minister “on the side of Biden or of Trump, on the side of Lula or of Bolsonaro”. While Feijóo has refused to explicitly rule out any deals with Vox come 23 July, his team is adamant that the newly centre-right PP will not be swayed by their competitors on the far right, stressing the conservatives will continue to defend equality policies, guarantee Spain’s system of autonomous regional government, and maintain the country’s fiercely pro-European outlook. The coming weeks will reveal whether Feijóo is the moderate he claims to be – or whether he is a more pragmatic and opportunistic political animal. For the currently bullish PP, however, he is very much the right leader at the right time. “He’s a tried-and-tested product,” says the adviser. “For good or for ill, we all know what Feijóo’s like.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/15/rolls-royce-boss-unable-to-see-secret-uk-documents-on-its-submarines-business","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T06:00:25Z","webTitle":"Rolls-Royce boss unable to see secret UK documents on its submarines business","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/15/rolls-royce-boss-unable-to-see-secret-uk-documents-on-its-submarines-business","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/15/rolls-royce-boss-unable-to-see-secret-uk-documents-on-its-submarines-business","fields":{"bodyText":"The chief executive of Rolls-Royce is unable to access top secret UK government documents relating to its submarines business, which powers Britain’s nuclear deterrent, it can be revealed. Tufan Erginbilgiç, who took over at the £12bn engineering giant in January, is prevented from viewing “UK eyes only” documents under Whitehall security protocols because he holds joint British and Turkish citizenship, sources said. The Guardian understands that Chris Cholerton, who became the company’s group president in March, has been given responsibility for handling sensitive information related to its submarine business, alongside Steve Carlier, president of the division. Sources close to the company questioned whether it was good governance to have a chief executive excluded from politically-sensitive information related to the business. Rolls-Royce’s submarines division builds the nuclear reactors that power Britain’s fleet of submarines, including the four nuclear warhead-armed Vanguard vessels. It employs more than 1,500 engineers to design, manufacture and support reactors for the vessels used by the UK’s Royal Navy as part of its “continuous at sea deterrent” capability and Rolls-Royce is growing the division significantly as it develops the next generation of reactors to go into the new Dreadnought submarines. The nuclear deterrent has been in place since 1969 and means at least one nuclear warhead-armed submarine, powered by Rolls-Royce, is always on operational patrol. The nuclear deterrent is governed under the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement between the US and the UK and the Polaris Sales Agreement, a treaty on missile systems, signed in 1963. The company also works on the submarines when they are at the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in Cumbria and the naval bases at Devonport in Plymouth, and Faslane on the Clyde. Last year, Rolls-Royce’s defence arm accounted for almost a third of its £12.7bn revenues. Erginbilgiç took over from Warren East, who had held the role since 2015, and immediately described the jet engines manufacturer as a “burning platform”. He has brought in consultants and is expected to cut thousands of jobs at the company, which has about 50,000 employees. Cholerton, the former president of Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace business, took on a new role two months ago including responsibility for its nuclear operations including submarines and its business developing small modular reactors (SMRs) – mini nuclear power stations. Erginbilgiç’s appointment was announced last year after a process run by search firm MWM Consulting. The board noted his background in engineering and experience in leading “complex multinational organisations”. Erginbilgiç’s family are from Kilis, close to the Syrian border. He studied engineering at Istanbul Technical University, graduating in 1982 and entered the oil industry after further studies in business and economics. He was chief executive of BP’s downstream business from 2014 to 2020. Erginbilgiç receives an annual salary of £1.25m and was handed shares worth £7.5m as compensation for forfeited pay from BP on joining. He was one of the frontrunners to replace former chief executive Bob Dudley but left the oil major after losing out to Bernard Looney. Rolls-Royce’s articles of association stipulate its chief executive and chairman must be a British, US or EU citizen. The UK government holds a “golden share”, allowing it to veto any takeover, because of its sensitive nuclear work. “UK eyes only” documents are typically marked “UK secret” with a statement that they have been “communicated in confidence” and “should not be released without the agreement of the British government”. The source close to Rolls-Royce said: “There have been questions raised internally about whether it’s right to have a chief executive who is not able to be included in some of the most sensitive areas of the business.” The navy uses a larger class of ballistic deterrent submarine, Vanguard, as well as the Trafalgar and Astute class attack vessels. In March, it was confirmed that Rolls-Royce would provide the reactors for Australia’s nuclear powered submarines as part of the Aukus trilateral pact between the UK, the US and Australia. On Tuesday the company announced plans to double the size of its Raynesway site in Derby as a result of the Aukus deal, creating 1,170 new roles. It is understood Erginbilgiç has clearance to access the site, which is only open to UK citizens. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson said: “As CEO, Tufan is fully responsible for the nuclear submarine business in Rolls-Royce and has all relevant oversight of the operation of that business. “As a global defence supplier, there are occasionally national eyes-only aspects of our work, such as in the US. In relation to the submarine business, Chris Cholerton, group president with responsibility for the submarine business, supports Tufan.” The company did not explain why, as a UK national, Erginbilgiç does not have nuclear clearance for sensitive documents. Rolls-Royce also operates two prototype reactor plants at a “trials establishment” in the north of Scotland on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Sources pointed out that US executives within the company had privileges not available to their British colleagues, and that the Ministry of Defence was aware of Erginbilgiç’s appointment before it was announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T13:25:05Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant plans have not been scrapped, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","fields":{"bodyText":"Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Sizewell C, which would sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast if built, was expected to provide up to 7% of the UK’s electricity needs and plug a looming gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities. The BBC reported on Friday that the government had put the project under review and it could be delayed or even axed entirely. However, Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters: “Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations ongoing. I can’t get into detail of those, but negotiations have been constructive.” However, Grant Shapps, the business secretary, gave a firm indication that a pledge from Liz Truss, Sunak’s predecessor as prime minister, to eventually connect northern towns and cities from Hull to Liverpool through Bradford will at the very least be scaled back. “There wasn’t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines … It’s not true to say we’re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north,” he told the BBC. When complete, the reactor, which was estimated to cost £30bn, with taxpayers expected to foot about a fifth of that in partnership with private funding, was expected to generate electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. The BBC said a government official had told them: “We are reviewing every major project, including Sizewell C.” Plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a high-speed line across the north of England sometimes referred to unofficially as High Speed 3, are also under review. The review of major projects comes as Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, prepare to announce tax and spending plans on 17 November. The Sizewell C site is one of eight new nuclear reactors that the former prime minister Boris Johnson had planned to give the green light to over the next eight years. Last month Truss, who was then prime minister, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, pledged “full support” for Sizewell C, which is to be jointly developed by the French energy company EDF. Most UK nuclear power plants will be shut by 2030 – Sizewell B is due to close in 2035 – and the energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine has put the focus on national energy security solutions. While campaigning for the Conservative leadership in the summer, Sunak pledged to uphold Johnson’s plan to build eight new reactors. He also argued in favour of reforming licensing laws to allow the government to build more nuclear plants in an attempt to achieve energy independence by 2045. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “If the government turns its back on [Sizewell C], they will be breaking all of the promises they have made, and undermining our vital nuclear industry.” But Alison Downes of the Stop Sizewell C campaign said: “Sizewell C can only offer short-term pain – with more money on our energy bills – for long-term pain, with huge uncertainty about cost and time, to deliver electricity that is far more expensive than renewables. There is no way Sizewell C offers the hard-stretched public purse value for money.” The government said that some major infrastructure projects were forging ahead, such as the rail line HS2, with one nuclear project set to be approved. “HS2 is under way, within budget, and supporting 28,000 jobs,” a spokesperson for the Treasury said. “We are also seeking to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next few years and aim to speed up the delivery of about 100 major infrastructure projects across the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/sep/08/peter-dutton-rejects-nationals-push-to-overturn-commitment-to-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-07T23:52:43Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton rejects Nationals push to overturn commitment to net zero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/08/peter-dutton-rejects-nationals-push-to-overturn-commitment-to-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/sep/08/peter-dutton-rejects-nationals-push-to-overturn-commitment-to-net-zero","fields":{"bodyText":"Peter Dutton has rejected a push within the Nationals to overturn the commitment to net zero by 2050, warning the Coalition “won’t be departing” from the policy after Barnaby Joyce labelled the cost “utterly untenable”. The Liberal leader told Radio National on Friday he was not concerned by Joyce’s intervention because there is “strong support for net zero” within the Coalition for the policy he had “recommitted to”. On Wednesday Guardian Australia revealed Joyce’s federal electorate council in New England had submitted a motion to this weekend’s Nationals conference calling on the parliamentary party room to “abolish its policy of net zero by 2050 and adopt a policy that will reduce Australia’s CO2 emissions in collaboration with the rest of the world”. The new motion – which some party sources interpret as a strategic strike intended to destabilise David Littleproud’s leadership – has alarmed moderate Liberals because the Nationals abandoning net zero would reopen an acrimonious internal Coalition discussion about climate policy. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Although Joyce insists he is not responsible for the motion, on Thursday he inflamed the issue by warning that the estimated $7-$9tn cost of net zero was “completely and utterly untenable”, likening it to the Marshall plan after the second world war. The Nationals agreed to net zero in October 2021 while Joyce was leader after the prime minister at the time, Scott Morrison, made it clear ahead of UN-led climate talks in Glasgow that he wanted that target to be government policy. Asked about Joyce’s comments on Friday, Dutton told Radio National: “No [it doesn’t concern me], there’s strong support for net zero. It’s a policy that we took to the last election. I’ve recommitted to it. We won’t be departing from it. “I believe very strongly we need to have a proper debate about how we credibly reduce emissions in this country.” The opposition leader warned that emissions reduction is struggling after the New South Wales Labor government “signed up to the extension of coal-fire power” and South Australia had moved manufacturing offshore to countries with “higher emissions”. He claimed nuclear energy could help firm up renewable electricity, citing Canada, France “and many other countries, over 50 countries now, so they see it as their only credible pathway to emissions reductions”. The Coalition has opposed Albanese government policies to help achieve net zero, including legislating the interim target of 43% emissions reduction by 2030 and the safeguard mechanism to slash emissions from big polluters. It is yet to present an alternative pathway to net zero. Despite the Coalition’s support for small modular nuclear reactors, the opposition has not released a policy explaining how to make the industry cost effective, the contribution from taxpayers and the timeframe for rollout. Dutton claimed that internal polling revealed a “shift” in support for nuclear, which he described as “strong … particularly with younger people who are well read on zero emissions [and the potential for] nuclear technology being able to firm up wind and solar and, you know, support hydrogen and other emerging technologies”. Response from federal Nationals to the New England motion was mixed on Thursday. The leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Bridget McKenzie, added fuel to the controversy by noting net zero is “pretty expensive” and accusing Labor of carpeting regional areas with solar panels and transmission lines. The deputy Nationals leader, Perin Davey, took a more cautious approach, welcoming a debate at the Nationals conference but noting the importance of keeping access to markets that demand net zero commitments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T15:32:00Z","webTitle":"Pentagon spokesperson tamps down concerns over nuclear ‘Armageddon’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/09/biden-armageddon-russia-nuclear-threat-pentagon","fields":{"bodyText":"The US military’s top spokesperson tamped down concerns of an imminent nuclear threat from Russia, days after Joe Biden warned of a potential nuclear “Armageddon”. Speaking at a Democratic fundraiser this week, Biden talked bluntly about the threat of a nuclear attack from Russia. “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis,” the president said. He added that the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, was “not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming” after invading Ukraine earlier this year. Echoing comments from the White House earlier this week, the top Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, said Biden’s comments were not based on specific new information. “His comments were not based on new or fresh intelligence or new indications that Mr Putin has made a decision to use nuclear weapons,” Kirby told Martha Raddatz in an interview on ABC News’ This Week. “Quite frankly, we don’t have any information that he has made that kind of decision. Nor have we seen anything that would give us pause to reconsider our own strategic nuclear posture.” Biden’s remarks invoking Armageddon drew a sharp rebuke from the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a member of the Donald Trump White House’s cabinet who is mulling a 2024 presidential run. “Those comments were reckless” and “a terrible risk to the American people”, Pompeo said on the Republican-friendly Fox News network. Kirby on Sunday also declined to weigh on a recent explosion on the Kerch Bridge linking Russia and Crimea, the Ukrainian territory under Russian control. The explosion dealt a blow to Russian military logistics and embarrassed Putin, for whom the bridge had symbolic personal importance. Ukraine has not yet claimed responsibility for the attack, but it has been celebrated by senior leaders in the country. “We don’t really have anything more to add to the reports about the explosion on the bridge,” Kirby said. “I just don’t have anything more to contribute to that this morning.” Kirby also addressed Biden’s comments last week that the US was trying to find where Putin could get an “off ramp” to the war on Ukraine. “Mr Putin started this war and Mr Putin could end it today, simply by moving his troops out of the country,” Kirby said. “He’s the one who chose to start this conflict again and he can choose to end it.” Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February. But Ukraine’s defenders in recent weeks have taken back some of the territories it had lost control of during the invasion. With its hold on Ukraine weakening, Putin recently ordered the mobilization of reservists to reinforce the invasion, which ignited protests in dozens of cities across Russia and has led to long lines at its land borders with other countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/02/our-worst-predictions-are-coming-true-italys-left-faces-identity-crisis-as-the-right-sweeps-to-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-02T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘Our worst predictions are coming true’: Italy’s left faces identity crisis as the right sweeps to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/02/our-worst-predictions-are-coming-true-italys-left-faces-identity-crisis-as-the-right-sweeps-to-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/02/our-worst-predictions-are-coming-true-italys-left-faces-identity-crisis-as-the-right-sweeps-to-power","fields":{"bodyText":"When the rightwing mayoral candidate in Lucca sought backing from the former leader of a neofascist movement, rivals on the left thought it would be enough to send a shiver down the spines of voters in the Tuscan city, one of the Italian left’s last strongholds. They were wrong. After a decade in power, the centre-left Democratic party (PD) was ousted, part of a wave of defeats over the past 12 months that has seen the Italian left’s version of the “red wall” crumble. In the past month, the rightwing coalition led by prime minister Giorgia Meloni has tightened its grip across Tuscany with fresh victories in Siena, Pisa and Massa. Mario Pardini, the businessman who became Lucca’s mayor, claimed the key to his success was listening to an electorate long disillusioned by its more distant leftwing governors. “I went around a lot and spoke to people to find out what mattered to them,” he added. “We had to get the city going, to bring it back to life and be more dynamic.” However it was the support of Fabio Barsanti, the former leader of CasaPound, a neofascist movement, that was decisive in Pardini’s victory. Barsanti and his CasaPound militants had long been making inroads in Lucca, a predominantly middle-class provincial capital, and its 33 towns. They used the movement’s trademark benevolent tactic of attending to the neglected poor by paying for their shopping and medical bills. Barsanti’s party, Difendere Lucca (Defend Lucca), brought the alliance an additional 9.5% of the vote. “Barsanti’s votes not only came from the right but from those who were disappointed with the left,” said Pardini. “At the local level, it’s no longer about left or right – it’s about people.” Nationally, the PD is currently Italy’s second-largest political force, albeit trailing behind Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist roots, by a wide margin. There was hope when the youthful Elly Schlein promised a “big small revolution” after being elected PD leader in late February. But that revolution is yet to come to pass. Unlike Siena and Pisa, Lucca is a more “contestable” city, which since the second world war has always veered slightly more towards the right than the left, said Francesco Raspini, the PD candidate who was defeated by Pardini. He blames the previous administration’s failure to adequately communicate its achievements, making it appear like a spent force, for its inability to hold on to power. “We also had to deal with the pandemic in the last few years,” he said. “The previous mayor didn’t run for election again, so it was very difficult to get a third mandate.” The PD fears it may now completely lose Tuscany, one of just four out of 20 regional administrations still in leftwing hands, in a vote in 2025 – and it faces an uphill struggle to be seen as a credible opponent to Meloni in time for the next general election. Schlein has so far failed to unite the party and gain traction with voters, so much so that the mayoral candidate in Vicenza, the only town that the PD managed to seize from the right in a late May runoff, asked her not to campaign alongside him over fears it would cost him votes. Schlein’s appearance on the front cover of Vogue Italia – her first interview after being elected, during which she admitted to hiring a pricey personal shopper – was also considered a faux pas that only reinforced the image of the PD as being elitist. At the same time, some PD members are concerned that Schlein – whose socialist, liberal platform champions everything from a minimum wage and green policies to LGBTQ+ rights and migration – is taking the party down a radical path, diminishing its appeal among voters and inviting a similar fate to that of Britain’s Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. “Our worst predictions are coming true,” said a source within the party. “The PD needs to renovate and be seen as a serious party of government, but people are no longer convinced.” In the wake of the local elections defeat, Schlein said opposition parties needed to come together in order to defeat the right, but she has been criticised for her overtures towards Giuseppe Conte’s populist Five Star Movement. “The meetings with Conte are incomprehensible,” added the source. “Yes, you need an alliance to be more competitive, but Conte should be coming to us and not vice versa.” Some prominent PD politicians have fled the party since Schlein was elected, including Enrico Borghi, who joined Italia Viva, the centrist party led by Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister and PD leader. “Schlein was supposed to represent a break from the past, but instead she took the party back 30 years. The Italian left is now going through the Corbyn phase,” said Borghi. “The PD failed to interpret and react to changes in the electorate. “As seen in the way elections played out in Greece, and what I fear will happen in Spain, each time that a moderate is given a choice between the conservatives and the radical left, the vote usually goes to the right. In this respect, the PD has chosen self-combustion.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 270 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) boss, Rafael Grossi, said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But he said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom had earlier accused Ukraine of shelling at the plant, which is under Russian occupation. Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but it was “very unlikely” that the clips showed what Russia claims. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday said 47 places had been identified where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainians. They include places in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Rishi Sunak made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Saturday to meet Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – Sunak’s first visit to the country since taking office. Sunak announced that Britain would provide a £50m air defence package for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Zelenskiy thanked Sunak, for his support and tweeted: “With friends like you by our side, we are confident in our victory. Both of our nations know what it means to stand up for freedom.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Five people were injured in a Russian strike on a humanitarian station in southern Ukraine, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Zelenskiy. Nine people, including four children, died in a suspected gas explosion in a residential building in Russia’s Sakhalin island, the local governor said. About 60 Russian soldiers were killed in a long-range Ukrainian artillery attack this week, Kyiv said on Saturday. In a Facebook post, the armed forces general staff said Russia sustained the losses on Thursday when Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Mykhailkva, 40km to the south of Kherson. Russian forces abandoned the city earlier this month. Kyiv is in a “critical situation” with power shortages and faces hours-long blackouts, officials say, amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. But the energy ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian electricity supplies were under control and there was no need to panic. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the supply problems were worst in and around Kyiv as well as in six other regions. “We are working throughout the country to stabilise the situation,” he said in a video address. Ukrainian forces could be in Crimea by the end of December, the country’s deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has said. The UK Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update on the war Ukraine. Russia made its largest single-day issuance of debt in history on Wednesday, it said. The first passenger train to the recently liberated Kherson city arrived from Kyiv for the first time since Russian troops occupied the southern Ukrainian city. The funeral took place on Saturday of a Polish man who was one of two people killed when a missile crashed into a grain storage facility in the Polish village of Przewodow. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said China and Russia were seeking a world where force is used to resolve disputes, and he vowed that the United States would continue to defend humanitarian principles and international law. Asia-Pacific leaders added their voices on Saturday to international pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, issuing a summit statement saying “most” of them condemned the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T09:21:39Z","webTitle":"Opposition leader makes fresh nuclear pitch – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/oct/27/australia-politics-live-industrial-relations-bill-reply-tony-burke-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-power-prices-economy-gas-electricity-budget-inflation-vic-nsw-qld","fields":{"bodyText":"With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Enjoy your night, we’ll be back first thing tomorrow for all the latest. Here were the major developments of the day: Opposition leader Peter Dutton delivered his budget reply speech, calling Labor’s budget a “missed opportunity” while acknowledging with a small olive branch the role of the opposition wasn’t to “oppose everything”. The family and domestic violence leave bill has passed the parliament. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. The Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, ruled that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time further to criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs. Landry says Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Dutton, not her. Tony Burke has called on parliament to legislate Labor’s industrial relations bill for “secure jobs and better pay”. The Greens want it to have greater focus on women and casual workers. The Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. And the latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. And there we have it. Mike Bowers was there, and captured a moment prior to the speech when former PM Scott Morrison shook hands with Dutton. As opposition, Coalition ‘will stand against Labor’s broken promises’ He concludes his speech with a shoutout to infrastructure investment, and the Coalition’s $120bn in funding for infrastructure over the next 10 years. In contrast, this government’s first budget axed $2.8bn of infrastructure projects and further delayed $6.5bn worth of projects. Mr Speaker, we will work to restore that funding in government. He digs in at Labor for the $2.2bn commitment to a Suburban Rail Loop in Victoria to “Daniel Andrews to help with his re-election”, which he says is a blow to regional Victorians. We will work with farmers as they face difficult struggles because there was nothing for them in this budget. Labor’s intent to reduce methane emissions by 30% will drive up the cost of meat at the supermarket. It’s not only bad for farmers, but it’s just added to your grocery basket [if you eat meat]. Mr Speaker, in conclusion, Australians will recall that, prior to the election, prime minister Anthony Albanese promised that he would be a leader who wouldn’t run from responsibility. He promised to lead a government that steps up, does its job, and doesn’t always blame someone else. For all their moral posturing and for all their promises, Labor shows, time and again, that their rhetoric in opposition never matches their actions in government. You are never better off when Labor has its hands on the budget. As opposition, we will stand against Labor’s broken promises. We will have a clearly defined, positive and bold plan ahead of the next election to take our country forward. We will support hardworking Australians. We will support all Australians. And we will rebuild a stronger economy for your family and for our country. Thank you very much. Dutton also echoes the support in funding for Ukraine – a “devastating reminder” we shouldn’t take for granted peace since world war two. He says the funding is a “signal of our values” and the Coalition will “stand shoulder to shoulder” to provide more support, including announcements made today. The threat of conflict as we know in our own region is real. As many military leaders have warned, we have to be realistic about the increasing prospect of conflict. He says the AUKUS deal will give Australia the “best chance of peace” by collaborating with our “two most important allies”. I take this opportunity to thank the wonderful members of the ADF, along with first responders, local councillors, community leaders, volunteers, and many more for their efforts in supporting Australians and communities affected by the recent floods. In government, we invested a record amount in our veterans. I thank the government for continuing that investment. The number of veteran suicides in our country remains far, far too high. It is a national tragedy. And the Coalition strongly supports the government’s commitment to expand the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme. Coalition supports Labor’s funding to end domestic violence Dutton praises Labor’s funding in the budget for ending domestic violence. We are all here in parliament to improve lives of Australians, especially children. He says his experience as a police officer particularly embedded this view. I saw the best and worst in society has to offer. I attended countless domestic violence incidents … the Coalition will invest significantly in these family support services and also to protect women and children from sexual assault. On to jobs. Dutton says Labor has “no plan” to save predicted job losses in the coming four years. Across the economy employers are crying out for workers – in June, the Coalition announced a policy to double the age and veteran service pension from $300 to $600 per fortnight … to allow older Australians and veterans to work more if they choose to do so without losing their pension payments … Labor’s policy is about 25% less than the Coalition’s proposal, and right now, we need more incentive in the system to get people more into work. He says Labor’s budget will “empower unions” and be a “throwback to the 1980s”. Labor’s changes will impose industry-wide one size fits all conditions … the last time they used strikes to pursue sector wide ultimatums, was in 1982. And in that year, unemployment reached 9.4%, inflation 12.4% and 2m working days were lost in industrial disputation. Labor housing promise a ‘Kevin Rudd design’ with no detail Dutton says the Coalition would help first home buyers to access their super for the “super homebuyer support” plan, announced during the election campaign. Currently, a superfund can be used to buy residential or commercial rental property, to buy shares or even livestock … except a home to live in … with $100,000 from super, the first home buyers wouldn’t have been able to afford their home. With access to super, they have a home to live in. If the house was sold after a decade, the $100,000 will be worth around $214,000. And if that was reinvested back, as would require, the couple would end up with a balance from that amount in the super when they retire of over $1 million. Under the Coalition government, we will extend the same option to women … with very few housing options and those who are increasingly left homeless. The Coalition has a strong record when it comes to getting first-time buyers and second parent families into their first homes. We support initiatives to increase the supply of housing but the government initiative has no detail. The Labor government has promised 1m additional homes in five years costing $10bn. Now, does anyone believe that? It’s a Kevin Rudd design. Dutton turns to family. He says his teenage boys are in their exams period in Brisbane and his wife is there “making sure they are studying and not watching television”. But I wanted to mention my parents, they are both unwell, unable to travel down but my dad was a bricklayer, my mum was a secretary … my parents had a very strong work ethic, the taught us to appreciate the value of money. We had a lot of support and love and not much money. It was a time when Labor was residing with high interest rates and unemployment. And it was a terrible time for the building industry. I was encouraged to get a part-time job as many kids in my generation [were] … From grade seven, I worked in a butcher shop after school and on Saturday mornings, scrubbing floors and washing up and serving on the counter. It was tough work but it was character building and gave me an appreciation for many different perspectives. I saved like crazy, one of my proudest achievements was buying my first home. It was nothing flashy and less than $90,000 from memory but it was mine. And today it is much higher. Dutton accuses Labor of planning to scrap stage-three tax cuts Back to tax. Dutton says “cost-of-living relief is interconnected with tax relief”. In a bit of a Thatcher throwback: You should keep more of what you own, hard-working Australia should be rewarded and the best reward is lower taxes. He touts the stage three-tax cuts, which will “lower tax for more than 10 million Australians” and “simplify our tax system”. Our plan means that the top 5% of income earners will pay 33% more income tax, you can work hard, take an extra shift or get a pay rise … without suddenly being pushed into a high tax bracket. Stage-three tax relief comes into effect on July of 2024 and … after interest rate rises, that’s when our economy will need it most. That’s when Australians especially deserve it. He says Labor has “laid the groundwork” to break their commitment to the tax cuts. The budget is intended to soften up Australia, gives the government time, with more excuses by May of next year, to tax more. Australia must follow US, UK and others on nuclear energy Now Dutton turns to nuclear energy. He says Labor is “misleading Australians” when it says it can “run out billions of dollars worth of transmission wires, cables and towers for renewable energies in just the next few years”. Regional communities … will be carpeted with up to 28,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines. Almost the entire coastline of mainland Australia or the distance of travelling from Melbourne to Perth four times. Every dollar spent will be paid for by consumers through higher electricity bills. He says Canada, France, Japan, South Korea, the UK and the US are all investing in “next-generation zero emissions nuclear small modular reactors to shore up energy security” and reach targets. The imperative to create affordable, reliable and emission free energy by the Coalition is seeking an intelligent conversation on the role of these new-age nuclear technologies. Investing in renewables is ‘crucial’ but Labor is phasing out fossil fuels too soon, Dutton says Dutton says investing in renewable energy and reducing emissions to protect the environment is “crucial” – quite a change of pace from the bring a bit of coal to work days. “We want a sustainable and sensible pathway to reduce our emissions,” he says, but “the technology does not exist” at the scale currently needed to rely on renewable energy at night or during peak periods. It is just the scientific reality. [We need to] use coal and gas, hydro, hydrogen, nuclear or battery as the energy source … when renewables are not fitting the system but Labor is going to phase out coal and gas before the new technology is being rolled out. In this budget the government makes it harder for more gas supply at a time when we need it most. On Tuesday night we saw the government rip up funding for gas exploration and cancel gas infrastructure projects which will eliminate shortfalls and make your bills cheaper. They handed over funding to environmental activists who want to overturn gas project approvals … a push for 82% renewables comes without a plan. Dutton continues to languish in the past for awhile. He says Australia “emerged as the envy of most nations” from Covid-19 in terms of its economic position. When you hear Labor carry on about a wasted decade, it is a distraction from the fact this government has no economic plan. And Labor will continue to misrepresent the truth until the next election to mask their bad decisions, most notably upon energy policy. He says six months ago the prime minister promised electricity bills would go down under his government, by $275. In this budget, instead of going down as promised, Labor’s plan was the electricity bills go up by more than 56% over the next two years [this wasn’t their plan as much as modelling]. Not only that, of course, but your gas bill will go up by more than 44%. Pensioners cannot afford that level of increase, and not just pensioners, self-funded retirees, families and small businesses as well, in fact, most Australians. In Europe we are hearing about people having to choose between paying their power bills or putting food on the table. Between heating or eating, this winter. Their electricity and gas bills are spiralling out of control … and despite those warnings and lessons, this government is following in the footsteps. Dutton: ‘We did not get everything right … but we kept the nation afloat’ Dutton lays out the Coalition’s priorities and where he says the budget has failed – energy policy, tax relief, housing, job shortages, industrial relations and infrastructure in the regions. He says the budget shows “yet again” that Labor “cannot manage the economy when it forms government” – a line that has been repeated by the Coalition for decades. Dutton contends there’s a “historical pattern” of Labor “creating a mess and the Coalition cleaning it up”, pointing to Howard after Keating, Abbott after Rudd/Gillard and the “back in black” 2019 budget … prior to Covid-19, and the biggest economic downturn since the great depression. It was only due to our economic management over the seven years prior to the pandemic that we were in a strong position to implement a suite of support measures. With 2020 hindsight we did not get everything right and some of the state lockdowns went on for far too long … but under our policies, we kept the nation afloat. Dutton says the prime minister has “broken his faith” with the public by admissions in the budget papers that by Christmas, a typical family would be $2,000 worse off. He admits this is amid war in Ukraine and surging power prices globally. Under the Labor budget, electricity prices are set to rise by more than 56% and gas prices by more than 44%. And we note that at these difficult times, nations around the world are contending with economic challenges born from the pandemic and amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but thanks to the Coalition … the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong. Cost of living is going up partly due to global conditions but also due to this Labor government’s decision. The treasurer said this government makes hard decisions for hard times but I say it makes … hard times even harder for all Australians. Whether you are young, raising a family or retired, whether you’re an employee or running a business, on Tuesday, the treasurer failed to mention in his speech what Labor’s paper revealed, everything is going up except your wages. Cost of living, power prices, taxes, interest rates, unemployment and the deficit are going up or will be going up under the government’s predictions … you have every right to be anxious and disappointed. Coalition does not oppose everything in the budget Dutton says the Coalition doesn’t oppose everything in the budget, nor is that the job of the opposition. He says the Coalition supports the childcare subsidy, investment into medicine, combatting domestic violence and funding towards flood recover. We do not disagree with everything in this budget and policy must be judged on its merits – if it is good for you, we will support it … there were several good measures in the budget. The extension of the childcare subsidy to more Australian families, the commitment to reduce the price of medicine. The initiative to combat domestic violence and the funding to help Australians recover from devastating floods. Labor budget ‘weakens Australia’s financial position’, Dutton says Dutton says the budget didn’t address economic challenges Australians are facing to “inspire confidence”. It is a budget that weakens Australia’s financial position rather than strengthens it and it adds to rather than alleviates cost of living pressures. Then he’s straight to anecdotes. “Kel” runs a multigenerational IGA supermarket in Queensland. He negotiated a commercial and industrial energy contract when the Coalition was in government and power prices were much lower than they are now. Today, his business is threatened as he faces an increase of $160,000 on the power bill from last year alone. The energy costs will go up further. A friendly reminder the Coalition were in government until the end of May. Opposition leader Peter Dutton is up. He starts his speech praising the nation, calling the budget a “missed opportunity” to help Australians at a time of uncertainty. We live in the best country in the world but for millions of Australians things are not easy now, [we are] facing increasing financial pressures, mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling up at the petrol station. Cost of living is skyrocketing and may soon be out of control yet it can be kept in check. But not while this Labor government makes bad economic decisions. A reminder, we will be hearing from the leader of the opposition Peter Dutton at 7.30 tonight as he gives his budget reply. We’ll keep the live blog open for the duration of the speech. Landry says not the first time Albanese has ‘treated me with disrespect’ Michelle Landry has issued a statement following criticisms regarding the conduct of the prime minister during Question Time today. Speaker of the house and Labor MP, Milton Dick, has ruled that Anthony Albanese was not disrespectful in an answer to Landry this afternoon, saying he was directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. Landry sees it differently. She says she was “yelled at and screamed at” across the chamber and felt “intimidated and bullied”. I respectfully ask the prime minister to publicly apologise to me in the House of Representatives. Albanese speaks to new UK PM Anthony Albanese has congratulated the UK’s new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on his new role. If all goes to plan in UK politics, they will hold their first bilateral meeting next month, at the G20 in India. Severe weather warning for Victoria’s southern alps Damaging winds averaging 60 to 70 km/h with peak gusts to 100 km/h are possible over Alpine areas in Mt Baw Baw on Friday afternoon. Further to the criticisms raised by Michelle Landry and other female Coalition MPs, the Speaker of the house, Milton Dick, has now ruled quickly that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was not disrespectful in his answer during question time earlier. Dick, also a Labor MP, told the house just before the chamber adjourned for the day: I have reviewed the footage and I can confirm that the prime minister was answering the question from the member for Capricornia. During the answer, the prime minister was also directly responding to interjections from the leader of the opposition. In reviewing the footage, I did not see the prime minister show any disrespect to the member for Capricornia. As the footage was not on the member for Capricornia for the entire response, I did not see her leave the chamber. Of the Capricornia that I was able to review, she appeared engaged in the response to the prime minister. Landry, along with the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, and other MPs have demanded Albanese apologise. Landry said the PM called her to say he didn’t mean to upset her. We’ve contacted Albanese’s office for response, and his side of the phone call. Meanwhile, Canberra’s own David Pocock has been up and about today: Fossil fuels 90% responsible for energy crisis – report The Climate Council has responded to a new global report which has found fossil fuels are 90% responsible for the energy crisis. The IEA’s 2022 World Energy Outlook, released today, found gas alone was 50% to blame for energy prices increasing. Former Origin Energy executive Andrew Stock, now a councillor with the Climate Council, said this week’s federal budget “spelled grim news for Australians already feeling the pinch”: The IEA report has made it abundantly clear that fossil fuels are the root cause of this problem, particularly gas, which is the most expensive form of power in Australia. This global report points to an obvious, affordable solution - a rapid transition to renewable energy. Which would be a win for households, businesses, jobs and the climate. Solar and wind are the cheapest sources of power globally, and are already outcompeting fossil fuels. The report highlights the forecast increase in total global energy demand to 2030 will be met almost entirely by renewables. The message for Australia is clear. After a wasted decade, we are now on the right track, but have tremendous ground to make up. The Climate Council says based on Australia’s high emissions, economic strength and untapped opportunities for renewable energy, it should be aiming to reduce its emissions to 75% below 2005 levels by 2030. As expected the Reserve Bank has reported a huge accounting loss for the 2021-22 year as it adjusted the value of the humongous bond holdings it snapped up during the Covid pandemic. The purchases of mostly federal (but some state) debt helped lower the borrowing costs for the then Morrison government (which also splurged $300bn-plus to keep the economy afloat). All up, the RBA more than tripled the size of its balance sheet to about $650bn when its special bond purchasing program stopped. Anyway, with interest rates rising, it had to reflect the lower market value of all that debt. For the domestic bonds alone, the unrealised valuation losses were $40.3bn. The overall accounting loss for the year was $36.7bn, a record with sunshine second. Equity also dropped to negative $12.4bn. But as the RBA report said: This negative equity position does not affect the Bank’s operations or its ability to operate effectively or perform its policy functions. The Board expects that the Bank’s capital will be restored over time due to positive underlying earnings and capital gains when bonds mature. What’s the take away? Treasury should not expect any dividends from the RBA for a long time. Also of interest, so to speak: Governor Phil Lowe’s total compensation dropped about 3.6% from the previous year, to a tad under $1.037m, or about $20,000 a week. Helen Haines welcomes announcement of single-site hospital for Albury-Wodonga Member for Indi Helen Haines has welcomed the announcement that Albury Wodonga Health will be redeveloped into an expanded single-site hospital. If you missed it earlier, the NSW and Victorian premiers fronted the media to announce a joint plan to overhaul Albury base hospital with a $558m redevelopment. Haines said she had made the case for a new hospital to the prime minister in their first conversation after the election. Doctors, health professionals, patients and the wider community have been campaigning for a new hospital for years and I have proudly stood beside them … this announcement is reward for our advocacy, the result of constantly fighting for our healthcare to be taken seriously by every level of government. This re-developed single-site hospital will benefit people all over North Eastern Victoria and Southern NSW – more care will be available close to home without having to travel to Melbourne. We will no longer face situations where some services are offered at one site, and other services on the other side of the border. Patients won’t wait hours to be transferred, or for specialists to travel from one hospital to another. This will lead to better health outcomes and be safer for patients.” But Haines argued it still falls short of what many in the community had lobbied for and wasn’t “the end of the fight on our health care”, with more needed to improve funding in regional and rural areas. She will be appearing in Wodonga tomorrow afternoon to hold a press conference. Greens call for Labor to put ‘women and carers first’ in proposed industrial relations bill The Greens have called for Labor’s proposed changes to industrial law to put “women and carers first” and lift wages of the low paid following workplace relations minister Tony Burke’s introduction of the bill to the house today. The party is aware its vote will be key to the industrial relations bill passing through the Senate. Senator Barbara Pocock, Greens spokesperson for employment, said evidence from submissions before the select committee on work and care showed 5 million people were trying to balance work with caring responsibilities. We need to move from the Hunger Games to roster justice, and decent work. That means adequate notice of shift changes, negotiation, minimum hours. Our major supermarkets can predict the kinds and quantities of apples they will buy tomorrow, but apparently can’t tell their workers what shifts they’re working. Being unable to plan your life or see your kids is hugely stressful. Many workers withdraw from the labour market because it’s impossible to juggle taking care of the kids and keep working. Australian workers, especially women, have waited decades for flexibility that actually works for them. They’ve waited for justice in their rosters, rosters and predictability of their working time. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the party had argued for a long time that industrial relations in Australia was broken. Pressure on workers has been growing for too long, wages have been too low, and people haven’t been able to bargain for better pay and conditions. Labor needs the support of the Greens to pass this bill. The Greens want industrial relations laws that work for women, work for carers and lift the wages of the lowest paid. That’s what we’ll be looking for as we work our way through this bill. Read about the bill here: The Bureau of Meteorology has released its climate outlook for the November to January period. Not great, but unsurprising news for some – rainfall is likely to remain above average for most of eastern Australia, particularly in the month of November. La Niña, a negative Indian Ocean dipole, an expected positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode and warmer waters around Australia are contributing to the wetter conditions. The BoM: For the fortnight 31 October to 13 November, above median rainfall is likely for most of eastern Australia. This increases to very likely for north-east and far south-east parts of the mainland. Below median rainfall is likely for large parts of Western Australia extending into the western Northern Territory. Maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of north-west Australia and Tasmania. Below median temperatures are likely for southern Queensland, and most of New South Wales and Victoria. Minimum temperatures are likely to be warmer than median for much of the northern halves of Queensland and the Northern Territory, and south-eastern Australia. Many thanks to Amy Remeikis for keeping us informed on a mammoth day, during a mammoth week. We’ll be keeping the blog open a little longer tonight to catch the opposition leader’s budget reply speech. And on that note, I will hand you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will take you through the evening. That’s it from me until the house sits again on 7 November – which is also when we will get budget estimates. Huzzah. In the meantime, thank you for joining me this budget week – you have all helped us get through it. Please – take care of you. Michelle Landry speaks here: Michelle Landry says Anthony Albanese called her after question time to apologise for upsetting her and said his comments were directed at Peter Dutton, not her. The latest people caught up in the Medibank cyber-attack are 4,400 patients in South Australia who had hospital care provided in the home as part of the My Home Hospital program. Medibank reported on Thursday afternoon that it had become clear overnight that the attacker had accessed patient information associated with the program that Medibank runs with Calvary on behalf of Wellbeing SA and the South Australian government. The insurer says the data accessed includes personal information and some health data. The My Home Hospital program provides services such as doctor visits, X-rays, blood tests, medication and meals in the home. Medibank said it has begun directly contacting the 4,400 affected patients, and that it had determined the data has been accessed, but did not know whether the data was taken from Medibank systems. Patients admitted on or after 13 October aren’t affected, Medibank said. Medibank has established a dedicated phone support service for My Home Hospital patients (My Home Hospital Cyber Response 1800 081 245). Josh Butler and Mike Bowers are at Sussan Ley and Michelle Landry’s press conference. We will bring you what they said very soon. (It is not being broadcast.) This was the beginning of Anthony Albanese’s answer to Michelle Landry’s question. You can hear Peter Dutton ask “where’s Yeppen?” Sussan Ley will hold a press conference in about 15 minutes. This is the subject line: The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Member for Capricornia and Coalition women will hold a press conference in the Opposition Courtyard of Parliament House in Canberra. Troubled air traffic management project to face increased scrutiny A new air traffic management system has been placed on the federal government’s defence project watchlist after delays and cost blowouts. The troubled project is called the Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System. It will replace the air traffic control systems at 12 Australian Defence Force (ADF) base locations with a new system that also covers non-military air traffic. Under the plans, Defence and Airservices Australia aim “to harmonise Australia’s civil and military air traffic management systems”. There should be “increased cooperation and collaboration between Airservices and Defence”, according to the project summary. But the minister for defence industry, Pat Conroy, announced this afternoon that the government had added it to Defence’s Projects of Concern list, a move that triggers increased scrutiny to try to fix problems: The Civil-Military Air Traffic Management System project has been listed as a Project of Concern because of significant schedule, technical and cost challenges ... The project has seen a two-year delay to forecast Initial and Final Operational Capability in the past two years. It is my expectation that this listing brings more high-level attention, resources and energy – from both Defence and our industry partner Thales Australia – to the task of remediating this project. It is not the first time this project has been listed as a Project of Concern. The Coalition listed it as such in August 2017, but a contract was signed the following year and was moved to the less-serious “Project of Interest” list. Michelle Landry leaves the chamber Michelle Landry left the chamber after Anthony Albanese’s answer to her question. I wasn’t in the chamber, so only saw the broadcast – and Albanese, when he was all agitated and yelling about the difference between Rockhampton (which Landry had asked about) and Yeppoon (which seemed to come as an interjection from Peter Dutton) didn’t address that part to Landry. But her position in the chamber, just to the side and back of Dutton, may have made it seemed like he was. The rest of the answer – about how the government would fund the project the Coalition was unable to (eventually it seems, the funding has been delayed) appeared to be addressed to the opposition at large. But at the same time, parliament seems to be the only place where yelling in the workplace is part of the culture. Opposition supports government’s announcement of more assistance for Ukraine Andrew Hastie has responded to the news Australian troops will be helping to train Ukrainian troops in Europe: The Coalition welcomes the Government’s announcement of further support to Ukraine, including an additional 30 Bushmasters to bolster efforts on the ground and the deployment of 70 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel to help train Ukrainian reservists in the UK. For some weeks now, Ukrainian Ambassador Vasyl Myroshnychenko has been calling for additional assistance from Australia and we are pleased to see those calls being answered. The ADF is among the most highly regarded armed forces in the world and we expect the 70 personnel being deployed to the UK will serve our country with distinction as they always do. It is a critical time for the Ukrainian government and people, who have defended their country with lion-hearts. They’ve won significant battlefield victories lately, and they are counting on our support to build on their gains. This assistance builds on the more than $285 million in military and humanitarian assistance delivered under the former Coalition government – including the original contribution of M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs), Bushmaster vehicles, M777 towed howitzers and ammunition, as well as anti-armour weapons and other weapons. Australia staunchly supports Ukraine’s sovereignty as we continue to call on Russia to cease their unprovoked, unjust, and illegal war. The Opposition supports the Government identifying ongoing assistance to Ukraine and welcomes the opportunity to receive full details about this announcement in the near future. Question time chats as captured by Mike Bowers: Anthony Albanese was quite shouty today. And question time, finally, finally ends. Sussan Ley wants the Speaker to review “the tone” of Anthony Albanese’s response to the question from Michelle Landry. Ley says Landry “left the chamber in tears” and wants a review of the footage. Milton Dick said he will review the footage and report back. Question time is still going because this week will never end and we are all living in the worst timeline. There won’t be the usual rush to the airport after this either, as the budget reply speech means that the MPs have to all hang around. Anthony Albanese, from NSW, just out-Queenslanded Queenslander Peter Dutton. Michelle Landry asked this question (she is the member for Capricornia, in Queensland). The federal government is intending to delay $800 million of commonwealth funding to construct the Rockhampton Ring Road by at least two years. (The rest of the question is about whether Anthony Albanese is breaking his promise to the people of Capricornia.) Anthony Albanese starts speaking about Rockhampton flood plains projects and the Yeppen lagoon, and then Peter Dutton interjects with something about Yeppoon, which is most definitely not in Rockhampton. Albanese: Yeppoon is a different place! Yeppoon is a different place, and you might want to ask the member for Capricornia, because Yeppoon is on the coast, north of Rockhampton and Yeppen floodplain is to the south. It’s the southern entry of the Bruce Highway into Rockhampton! Queenslander! It says it all! It says it all! He goes on with a bit of spring in his step about how Labor will get the project done. The member for Longman, Terry Young, has a question for Chris Bowen: I refer to an answer earlier this week on RGS, a manufacturer of my electorate that uses over 200 megawatt-hours per year [that experienced an] increase of about $40,000 in power bills. The default market offer to which the minister referred in his answer is only available to small businesses that consume 100 mega kilowatt hours. The minister did not answer my question. I ask again, [on] the prices facing this and many other businesses … what is the government doing about it? Bowen: Thank you very much. I thank the honourable member for his question. My concern goes to all businesses in Queensland and across the country. It also goes to all households across Australia and their energy bills, because we want to work and we are working and we will work to ensure that our prices are as well as possible. … In the budget we had a choice. We could have penned the pressures on power prices, option A, that the previous government took. We could have hit that, or option B is to be upfront with the Australian people about the pressures. That’s the option we took. That’s the option we took, we have the option of being honest to the Australian people. And that is where Angus Taylor gets booted out, given his interjections ramp up. Bowen: It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us. We are concerned and upfront in relation to Queensland small businesses, small or large or medium, we should care about them all. The increase in small-business prices was 12.8%, $705 and I make no apologies appointed out of the house and the Australian people. Paul Fletcher: This repeated claim of hiding … the standing orders are very clear. All imputations of improper motives to a member shall be considered highly disorderly. It is clearly what this minister is repeatedly doing, and I ... Chris Bowen: Certainly. Thank you, Mr Speaker. The fact is … the previous minister hid the facts and he should be ashamed of himself. Angus Taylor has been booted from the chamber under 94A. “It’s a sad outcome that the member for Hume has left us,” Chris Bowen says. Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus. Amanda Rishworth takes a dixer just to remind everyone the Coalition called mothers “double dippers” on the paid parental leave payment (when they were legally taking what their work offered and topping it up with the government plan, as was intended) on Mothers’ Day. Good times. (Also a reminder that paid parental leave and increasing the childcare subsidy doesn’t make it a “family” budget. Your family can look any way you want it to, and it doesn’t have to involve children – and that is before we get to the people who have older children who don’t use the subsidy any longer.) The member for Lindsay, Melissa McIntosh, seems to have practised delivering this question a few times. We love a fresh delivery. Get those toastmaster points! McIntosh: In the lead-up to the 2022 election, and since, the government has repeatedly cited modelling forecasting that wholesale and residential electricity prices would decrease by 18% but the government’s budget tells us that Australians can expect increases in electricity, gas prices of 50% and 40% respectively. Will the prime minister now admit that the modelling Labor stood by was flawed and so too are the government’s energy policies that relied on that modelling? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. Indeed, we did release modelling done by RepuTex in 2021. After that occurred, of course, there was not modelling but in fact, a factual change that occurred in May 2022 from the Australian Energy Regulator that pointed to a 20% increase in costs of electricity, and that flowed through to wholesale prices. Of course, there are a couple of pressures on energy prices. One, of course, is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the second ... (interjections, etc) … What I was asked about occurred in 2021. If you go back to when the Russian invasion of Ukraine was, I think you’ll find out, because I remember, because you should recall President Zelensky spoke just before my last budget reply in March of this year to this chamber. The second pressure, of course, is the failure to invest, the fact that four gigs went out and one gig of energy went in. … That led to a massive failure to invest. Three years ago, before the 2019 election, of course, there was a promise of a billion dollars towards new generation, a billion dollars. That would have added to 3,800 megawatts of new generation. So that would have meant instead of four out one in, that would have been 4.8 out - in and four in. (there is about 10 seconds of interjections and calls for order) … Three years later not a single dollar of that was delivered. Not a dollar, … not any megawatts, they aimed for 3,800, they delivered zero, zero, zero, a big duck egg. Not one watt of new generation as a result of that announcement. Of course that’s before we go to the farcical situation of the Collinsville promise that was never delivered either. And he’s out of time. Catherine King ‘rejects entirely’ idea that Darwin investment for gas-based manufacturing is subsidy for fossil fuels Dr Monique Ryan has another of the crossbench questions (and this is what Stephen Bates was getting at) My question is for the minister for infrastructure and regional development. In this week’s budget, your government allocated $1.5 billion for the Middle Arm industrial zone in Darwin Harbour. Middle Arm proposes Perth chemical manufacturing using gas from the Beetaloo Basin. Unless that changes, this is a subsidy for the fossil fuel industries. Will you guarantee the Middle Arm precinct will not produce petrochemicals or gas-based manufacturing? Catherine King: Thanks very much to the member for Kooyong for your question. Well, the Australian government invests in projects such as the Middle Arm precinct in an important way of setting up our economy for a sustainable future. Instead of funding any particular companies or particular industries, we’re actually investing in common use enabling infrastructure. We do that across industrial precincts across the country to give all potential users in the market the opportunity to grow and thrive. This includes those able to process and export green hydrogen and energy transition components made locally. The government is providing in the budget $1.9 billion in planned equity to support the development of Middle Arm, together with regional logistic hubs in the Northern Territory across those key transport links. That’s what we’re doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive, to be sustainable, with a focus, I recognise that the - I can hear some interjections from the member for New England about that. He likes this - I know he likes this particular project, which I’m very happy about. (Interjections) … No, no, I was, I was actually acknowledging that that’s what he was doing. This investment will enable the precinct to be globally competitive and sustainable but it will focus on low emission hydro-carbons, green hydrogen and critical minerals processing. Demand we know ... Ryan gets up and she is not happy with what she has been hearing: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was hoping for an answer to my question. Spicy! But not a point of order. Still, nice to see another new member of the crossbench settling in to the rhythm of the place. King: As we know, the demand is growing for clean energy sources and Labor’s investment will help position the Northern Territory and Northern Australia to actually diversify their economy and to create jobs. This investment is not a subsidy for fossil fuels. I reject that entirely. Rather funding will go towards the infrastructure that will support users to export clean energy, critical to meet our commitment to net zero. Like green hydrogen and lithium batteries that are critical, critical, to decarbonisation, common user infrastructure at Middle Arm and industrial precincts across the country which the commonwealth regularly invests is included in Infrastructure Australia’s infrastructure priority list of nationally significant proposals and the project is currently at the stage 2 assessment process. The Middle Arm precinct is undergoing significant environmental assessments under the Northern Territory Environment Protection Act and the federal Environmental protection and biodiversity Act. These assessments will understand the impact of the proposed construction in the Northern Territory has completed and commenced over 200 investigations including feasibility studies into land and marine development and environmental culture and heritage. This is good for the Territory. It’s good for the nation. And I reject absolutely it being a fossil fuel subsidy. David Littleproud is back! My question is again to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new poles and wires under the government’s energy policy. Chris Bowen: Again, Mr Speaker, this is the new culture war from the leader of the National party and I wish him well on it. If this is the hill he chooses to die on, Mr Speaker, that’s a matter for him. Because he’s referring to the green hydrogen superpower option under the ISP which was released while they were in office. Which was released while they were the government, Mr Speaker. It’s actually a document which had bipartisan support, Mr Speaker. … He refers to the government’s 28,000km of transmission lines. In fact, we’re implementing – seeking to implement the ISP step change model. He’s talking about something completely fraudulent, Mr Speaker. And also we are getting on with the job of better consultation because what really matters is route selection. Route selection, there are options to where the routes go. They can go on public land, they can after appropriate community consultation and appropriate conversation go with private land. So I guess could a nuclear power plant which the leader of the National Parties seems so addicted to. It is back to David Littleproud’s poles and wires question – this is something he has been asking about for the last couple of days: My question is to the minister for climate change and energy: how many private properties will be impacted from the construction of the 28,000km in new polls and wires under government’s energy policy? Angus Taylor has a lot to say as Chris Bowen comes up to the despatch box. Bowen: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. The leader of the National Party refers to the ISP, the integrated systems plan, the 28,000km figure refers to the green jersey superpower scenario. 10,000km is a step change. The Government is getting on with implementing the ISP through the rewiring the nation policy. Just tomorrow, the nation’s Energy Ministers will meet and review progress in reforming the regulatory process of transmission to improve community consultation and compensation - a process started by this Government. Not started by the previous Government because we want to ensure communities are consulted properly. Littleproud: Relevance, Mr Speaker. The question was very tight. It asks for a specific number of properties that will be impacted by the 28,000km of poles and wires. Milton Dick: Thank you for that. The minister is in order. He’s been going for 40 ... There are interjections from Littleproud, and Dick continues: If you let me finish, leader of the Nationals. He’s been going for 40 seconds. There was a specific question in there regarding a number and I will ask the minister to return when he’s ready to that part of the question and I give him the call. Bowen: Thank you, Mr Speaker. And the leader of the National party asked me about the 28,000km which is the green hydrogen superpower scenario and 28,000km under that scenario, which was prepared under the previous Government. Mr Speaker, as I said, energy ministers tomorrow are reviewing the progress in reforming the RET. We’re hearing from the renewable energy commissioner, a federal government appointee, who has been working with the New South Wales state government and doing excellent work, Mr Speaker, just this week. They announced a new compensation regime for people impacted. Now the leader of the National party is very concerned about social licence. I welcome his interest. I welcome his interest in the social licence ... The interjections go up to 11 so Dick has to step in again: You may resume your seat. Order. When the House comes to order, I’ll ask the minister to address that part of the question. He’s still got 1.5 minutes to go. I’m listening ... listening carefully to his answer. He has three minutes to answer the question. There is no time constraint about when he has to answer. I’m listening quite carefully. The Leader of the House. Tony Burke: Just to raise a point of order. There’s the normal rule about a point of order on direct relevance only being able to be taken once. The opposition having already raised that have now decided from the interjections to not be shouting at the government but in fact to be shouting at you and about your ruling and I just want to draw your attention to it and in my role as Leader of the House, just... (There are more interjections) Burke: Your can interject on me all you want, but you don’t do it to the Speaker. Dick: Order. Members on my left [the opposition] – members on my left will cease interjecting. I’ll ask the minister to return to that part of the question and I told the House I’m listening carefully to the answer. The minister may continue. Bowen finishes with: We’ll continue to work with the renewable energy commissioner, with my states and territories colleagues, and continue to oppose your plans to put nuclear reactors right across Australia which doesn’t have community support or licence. Opposition’s strategy was to arm Australian defence ‘with press releases’, defence minister says Richard Marles takes a dixer (a question the government has written itself) on defence procurement, so he can reprosecute some old numbers, but with some new hoo-hah: In coming to office, the Albanese Labor government has inherited a defence procurement mess. When those opposite were in power, there were 28 different programs that were running a total of 97 years over time. Hunter class frigates four years late - $50 billion over budget. The Spartan battle field aircraft, 4.5 years late, offshore patrol vessels a year late, Cape class patrol vessels another year late, that’s before we even start talking about submarines. When it came to defence announcements, those opposite were best in class. Vaudeville, Hoopla, we saw Top Gun music, all showtime. It was as if they were trying to tap-dance our adversaries into submission ... Their strategy was to have Australia walk on to the battlefield armed with press releases. But when it comes to actually delivering capability, getting the hard power equation right, those opposite were the single worst defence procurement government in our nation’s history, and not least because they, themselves, were a picture of chaos. In nine years we had six, really seven different defence ministers, the last of whom is sitting right there as the leader of the opposition. All of this at a time when we are facing the most precarious strategic circumstances since the second world war. Under those opposite, Australia’s lost decade could not have come at a more damaging historic moment. Big and medium-sized businesses support budget, Albanese says It’s time for Angus Taylor to ask about the cost of living which is one of the things in question time Jim Chalmers and half of the Labor bench seem to live for. Taylor: My question is to the prime minister. The budget confirms that a typical family will be $2,000 worse off by Christmas with inflation, interest rates and unemployment all forecast to go up. Given this increasing pressure on the cost of living, what specific action is the government taking to fast-track new natural gas projects and when can Australians expect to see relief? Anthony Albanese: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the shadow treasurer for his question. Of course, they had a shadow treasurer even when they had a treasurer. But we have one treasurer and he’s done a fantastic job. And the budget has been well received by people who are economically literate. … This is what Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council had to say: ‘Amid global economic turmoil, this budget steadies the ship and sets the groundwork for reform to drive economic growth in the May budget. This is a cautious and careful budget that avoids making our inflation problem worse. ‘This is a crucial first step to restoring our budget position and building our national resilience. We welcome investments to boost productivity and participation through skills, education, child care and expanding paid parental leave. We strongly support the Government’s comprehensive skills package and migration announcement.’ … But the ACCI said this, and Drew Mackellar said this: ‘Tonight’s budget is a responsible one. This budget covers the essential elements of economic management and tackling growing cost pressures. ‘As the budget warns, we cannot afford to be complacent against a global headwinds of severe inflation, climbing interest rates and soaring energy prices. Through the Powering Australia plan and funding for new energy infrastructure, the budget finds significant investment to underpin the transition to a net zero future that supports new opportunity for industry.’ So we have big business supporting the budget. We have medium-sized business supporting the budget. (There are a bunch of interjections and I miss the middle part of the answer.) This is what the Master Builders had to say, again, apparently an affiliate of the Labor party: ‘The 2022 housing accord is a welcome signal to the building and construction industry who have been crying out for action to address housing affordability barriers and supply constraints.’ I have got more, Mr Speaker, but I’ll wait for the next question for the further endorsements done by people who used to be their allies, who they now ridicule. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on how Labor supports women. Moving on. Not sure if some in the opposition needed a trigger warning, because Greens MP Stephen Bates has one of the crossbench questions and he is still not wearing a tie*. I’m sure one of the clerks has the smelling salts ready just in case. Bates: my question is to the minister for industry, science and resources. Why does the budget contain more than $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies including $30 million to frack for gas in the Beetaloo Basin and almost $2 billion to fund a gas export terminal in Darwin Harbour when we are in the middle of a climate emergency? Ed Husic seems happy to get a call up, but he doesn’t have much of an answer for Bates. But he, in what has become his way in his dealings with the crossbench, keeps it very civil and polite. Thank you very much, Speaker, and thank you to the member for the question. A lot of that is not directed necessarily in my own portfolio and relates to other areas, but we’re happy to take it on notice and we’ll get back to you with some response. *we approve of the no tie, btw. Blame for state of energy markets ‘rests squarely with Vladimir Putin’, treasurer says Jim Chalmers gets a dixer just to give Peter Dutton a sledge ahead of his budget reply speech: We’re told today that the leader of the opposition in his speech tonight about the appropriations wants to talk about the [previous] government’s economic record. And this is his opportunity – he takes very seriously his responsibility as the leader of the leftovers, Mr Speaker, and in doing he has a rolled gold opportunity tonight to fess up for the Coalition record on the economy – and let’s consider it for a moment. Their record on the economy is skills shortages holding the economy back. It’s stagnant wages for a decade. It’s weak productivity and business investment. It’s an aged care crisis, it’s a trillion dollars in debt with nowhere near enough to show for it and it’s this energy policy chaos which is making us more vulnerable to global energy shocks. Mr Speaker, what we’re seeing in our energy markets right now, the blame for that, rests squarely with Vladimir Putin. Albanese: Business and ‘more enlightened members of the Liberal party’ both recognise renewables are cheaper And after Mark Butler has some fun in a dixer about how terrible he thought his predecessor was, we move to another groundhog day moment when Sussan Ley, who is still trying to work out how she plays her role as shadow minister for government attacks, asks: My question is to the prime minister. Yesterday, the treasurer finally confirmed that the Labor party misled the Australian people 97 times before the last election on their promise to reduce power bills by $275 when he admitted it wasn’t in the budget after saying it was. Given the treasurer has now apologised to one Australian over this – Charles Croucher from Nine News – when will the other 26 million Australians get their apology? And the chamber is in uproar. Anthony Albanese: Mr Speaker, I thank the deputy leader for her question. I reject the premise of the question. Because it goes to a failure for those opposite to actually recognise that renewable energy is the cheapest form of new energy. Yesterday I spoke about the deal that was done with the Tasmanian government and what they have to say, what the Victorian government have to say as well, and I spoke about what the New South Wales premier had to say. But I agree with the statement that the cheapest, most reliable and cleanest energy on the planet are renewables. I agree with the member for Barker. I agree the cheapest way to deliver electricity today is not coal, it’s not gas, it’s certainly not nuclear; it’s wind, solar, backed up by pumped hydro and batteries. So if you care about cheap energy and reliable energy, then you’re looking at wind, solar and pumped hydro. Now, they’re not my statements, Mr Speaker. They’re the statements of Matt Kean, the New South Wales treasurer, the deputy leader of this deputy leader’s party in New South Wales. Ley pretends she has a point of order: A point of order on relevance, Mr Speaker. Why can’t the Prime Minister say $275 ... Milton Dick is not having it: Resume your seat. I was pretty clear yesterday about that abuse of standing order. The deputy leader has special privileges which she’s taken advantage of. I just remind all members to state the point of order of relevance. I will take the point but if it continues I will not take them anymore. I give the call to the prime minister. Albanese: Thanks. But it’s not just more enlightened members of the Liberal party who recognise that the earth is round and renewables are the cheapest form of new energy. It’s also the business community. It’s what Jennifer Westacott said … Jennifer said this: ‘You’ll also be paying less for your power because at the moment, building new renewables is cheaper than building new coal and cheaper electricity will continue to drive down energy prices.’ That is what the business community says, and that is what state and territory governments say. What do those opposite do? They pretend that they didn’t know. They pretend the former energy no-one didn’t know about regulations that he was delivering to hide a determination by the Australian Energy Regulator, until it just happened to be [that they] replaced the 1 May with 25 May. In between 1 May and 25 May? What happened? What was it that happened on 21 May? [The election, in case you forgot.] They wanted to avoid the Australian people before they voted, knowing about the hike in energy prices that was occurring on their watch because of their failure to invest in energy. And he runs out of time. Milton Dick gives a general warning to the whole chamber, because he is still trying to pretend he has control over the members. Peter Dutton asks Anthony Albanese to withdraw the “unparliamentary language” he used against Angus Taylor. Albanese: Mr Speaker, it’s one of the nicest things I’ve said about the shadow treasurer. Just wanted to give a bit of space between those posts and what is happening in the parliament now. Peter Dutton opens question time with: I refer to the economic plan and budget strategy available on the Labor party’s website, page seven of the document outlined a five-point economic plan, the first point is and I quote, ‘to cut power bills by $275 a year by 2025’. With the budget confirming this promise has been broken, will the prime minister admit the economic plan is in ruins? The Speaker, Milton Dick, tries to get ahead of the circus: The leader of the opposition has asked this question and I just said that the prime minister will be heard in silence. I want to be clear today, questions will be heard in silence out of respect of the office of the person asking them but also, answers will be heard in silence. And I give the call to the prime minister. (But also, lols – this is his circus and these are his monkeys, so good luck trying to wrangle this lot.) Albanese: Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. And indeed, before the election, there were a range of things said and indeed, when confronted with the fact that when in government, there was a warning of a pending spike in energy prices and that the announcement was delayed until after the election. This is what the former ... (INTERJECTIONS). … This is what the shadow treasurer said yesterday, the 26th of October, he said this: that was a report from the Australian Energy Regulator. It puts it out, not me, and I didn’t say it. That’s what he said. Yesterday, yesterday. Well, that’s interesting, Mr Speaker. Because this is the very document that goes to the increase that has occurred in the default retail price which has fed into energy prices increasing by figures around about 20%. He said he didn’t see it and didn’t know about it. An interesting statement. Here, of course, is a document, 22-23, the final determination of May 2022 and I tabled the document. I tabled a document from the Australian Energy Regulator. But at the same time, at the same time, here is the change in the law, dated the 31 March, 2022 and like he said, he didn’t see it, didn’t know about it, he puts it out, not me … Paul Fletcher: It’s on relevance. He’s had a 2-minute preamble. You should bring him back to the topic of the question, the $275 reduction that was promised. Albanese: Point of order, Mr Speaker. The question went to what was said about energy prices before the election in May 2022. My answer has gone to ... (The opposition benches all interject.) Albanese: I was going to what was happening to prices in May 2022, and [that] can’t be more relevant to the question that was asked by the leader of the opposition. So I’d ask you to rule against the point of order. Dick: The prime minister is correct when he says that the question was about five points announced before the election. The prime minister is referring to the policy announcement and what was announced, so the prime minister is being directly relevant. And I give the call to the prime minister. And then it is finally back to the answer. Albanese: Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. And here’s the regulation, the change in the law, 31 March 2022, from Angus Taylor, who said he didn’t see it or know anything about it. There’s two simple changes. Item 1, paragraph 17, omit may substitute the first business day of 25 May. How subtle is that? How subtle is that? They changed the law ... in March, when the regulation – after parliament couldn’t disallow the change in regulation because we were going into caretaker mode and [couldn’t] change it until after the election. What a farce. You have no credibility. And he has run out of time. Ahead of question time, during the 90-second statements, the member for Hasluck, Tania Lawrence spoke about the death of 15-year-old Cassius Turvey. Linda Burney and Marion Scrymgour were also obviously distressed. Peter Dutton calls for royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities Both Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton are speaking on the anniversary of the national apology to survivors and victims of institutional child sexual abuse. Dutton says it is time for an inquiry into the sexual abuse of Indigenous and First Nations children. Dutton: The national apology came to fruition because of the royal commission, and in the spirit of the fourth anniversary and our enduring commitment to keep children safe, it is time for a new royal commission to examine child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. We support immediate action from this government and the Northern Territory government on this incredibly important issue. I thank the prime minister and the minister for their time … [I have] met with the prime minister on two occasions now and it is an issue that we continue to work on together. The Coalition dedicates ourselves to supporting action taken by the government; there is goodwill on both sides for this national issue that needs addressing now. Law enforcement committee issues statement on Lidia Thorpe’s referral to privileges committee The parliamentary joint law enforcement committee, of which Lidia Thorpe was a member, giving rise to a potential conflict of interest with her relationship with ex bikie Dean Martin, has issued a statement about the controversy. On Tuesday the Senate referred Thorpe to the privileges committee for investigation, after the Greens senator agreed to refer herself. In its statement, the law enforcement committee said: [The committee] has met to consider questions arising from Senator Thorpe’s failure to declare a personal relationship that could potentially be a conflict of interest while she was a member of the committee during the last parliament. The committee takes the integrity of its proceedings very seriously and [in] its meeting the committee affirmed its commitments to protecting the confidentiality of sensitive and classified material ... The committee also affirmed that members should declare conflicts of interest that relate to their duties, so that the declared matters can be dealt with appropriately. The committee noted the referral to privileges, and said it would “cooperate with that inquiry and may provide evidence ... as appropriate”. Question time is just a moment away so we are in the chamber for the 90-second statements and Anthony Albanese has just taken one of those slots to pay tribute to outgoing NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard. Who is from the Liberal party. Peter Dutton associated himself with the comments. Newest inflation data prompts banks to predict higher RBA cash rate hikes On interest rates, reverberations from Wednesday’s inflation report, banks have shifted their predictions of what the RBA’s peak cash rate will be. The annual CPI came in at 7.3%, or the highest since mid-1990, as we noted here. Westpac now expects the central bank will return to hiking by 50 basis points when it meets on Melbourne Cup Day, next Tuesday, doubling their forecast. Anyway, here’s how another half-percentage point rate increase will lift monthly interest repayments, according to RateCity. The CPI result also triggered the banks to predict the RBA will now have to lift its cash rate higher. Here’s how the various outcomes would translate into monthly repayments: It’s worth noting the budget calculations on future growth in the economy were modelled on the RBA’s cash rate peaking at 3.35% next year. Perhaps Treasury will look like optimists by next May when the 2023-24 budget is released. Senate inquiry into school refusal established The senate has established an inquiry into school refusal, which is something Sophie Black has been looking into. This is the motion which established the inquiry – which was moved by Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne. The national trend of school refusal or “School Can’t” – as distinct from truancy – that is affecting primary and secondary school aged children, who are unable to attend school regularly or on a consistent basis, with specific reference to: 1) the increasing number since the Covid-19 pandemic, of young people and their families who are experiencing school refusal; 2) how school refusal is affecting young people and their families and the impacts it is having on the employment and financial security of parents and carers; 3) the impacts and demands of the increasing case load on service providers and schools to support these students and their families; 4) how relevant state, territory and federal departments are working to monitor and address this growing school refusal challenge; and 5) any other related matters. School refusal isn’t just a case of kids not wanting to go to school – it is a health issue, impacting their emotional and mental wellbeing and leading to anxiety, physical ailments and more. It has really hit some families very hard, particularly since the pandemic. They actually make you identify all these birds before allowing you into the ACT. It’s one of the rules. Business confidence holds up despite rising costs, NAB says In light of the budget, discussion about soaring energy prices and the record string of six consecutive RBA rate hikes, it’s worth checking on how the economy is actually faring. Well, according to NAB’s quarterly survey of small- and mid-sized enterprises, conditions are softening but remain above longer-term averages. Confidence even edged higher in the September quarter, with the smallest firms more chipper than bigger ones (even with conditions actually deteriorating more for them than for larger companies). “SMEs in transport, accommodation &amp; food, finance, and wholesale all reported strong conditions, while conditions remained fairly robust across the states,” it said. Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist, said: “Across all our surveys, firms are reporting capacity utilisation at record levels and SMEs are no exception. “Clearly, with a very tight labour market and very strong demand, even the smallest firms are operating close to their limits,” he said. The health minister, Mark Butler, says the government is expecting advice in coming months from immunisation experts on whether Australians should be given the opportunity for a fifth dose of Covid vaccine, but is still urging millions of people who haven’t got a third dose yet to get their booster. Butler held a short Parliament House press conference to celebrate the passage of Labor’s cheaper medicines bill passing the parliament. He was asked about whether Australians will be given an opportunity for a yearly Covid dose, similar to annual flu jabs. Butler didn’t say specifically whether all Australians would be recommended to get an annual dose, but said Atagi – the technical advisory group on immunisation – was considering whether older people and those with immune conditions should be granted a fifth dose, on top of the current four. Butler said Atagi would give that guidance “in due course”, but that he didn’t expect it in “the near future”, saying it may be into 2023 before that change is considered. But he also took the opportunity to urge people who hadn’t yet received a third dose – which he said included 5 million eligible people – to get that booster shot. There are just under 30 minutes until the last QT of the week. There is a week break and then budget estimates will be held while the house sits. November is a little full, actually – three sitting weeks. And the possibility of a fourth being held in the second week of December is a spectre that won’t go away – it is really going to depend on how much legislation gets passed in the Senate in the last two weeks of November. Some more background on that space promise: The Albanese government’s pledge is in line with allies. In April the Biden administration committed “not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing” and it pointed to such tests being done by China and Russia. When the then defence minister Peter Dutton announced the launch of the Australian defence force’s new space command in March, he accused some countries – including Russia – of seeing “space as a territory for their taking”. Dutton cited an anti-satellite missile test in November last year when Russia “destroyed its own redundant Cosmos 1408, which left behind a cloud of more than 1,500 pieces of lethal debris that will take decades to clear”. The new head of Australia’s space command, Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, said in March: The activities by China and Russia, which have been fairly well documented in the public domain, scare me. I think our lack of capability at the moment against those threats … that is concerning. Air Commodore Nicholas Hogan, who joined the space command as the director general of space capability, raised concerns at the time that the lack of established norms or laws in space created a “wild west” scenario. Australian government pledges never to conduct ‘direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing’ The Australian government has announced a promise “to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing”. It says the pledge is “consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space” and it is calling on all nations “to make this commitment as a transparency and confidence building measure”. In a statement issued in the last few minutes, three senior ministers - Penny Wong, Richard Marles and Ed Husic – said: The Australian Government commits to never conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti‑satellite missile testing, consistent with our role as a responsible actor in space. When carried out, these tests generate large amounts of debris that remain in space for years; threatening satellites and other space objects, and risking the long-term sustainability of human activity in space. The use of these missiles to destroy space objects is reckless, irresponsible and poses threats to space assets of all nations. Australia joins the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Germany and the Republic of Korea in making this commitment toward a safer, more stable and peaceful space domain. Marles, the defence minister, said the government was making the pledge to demonstrate “Australia’s commitment to act responsibly to protect our national security interests”. Wong, the foreign affairs minister, said the global community “must work together to build a common understanding on rules and norms that can guide how states behave in outer space”. Husic, the minister for industry and science, said: Space technologies support critical services that improve national wellbeing and economic prosperity. This commitment is a responsible step to help ensure space assets are protected for the benefit of all Australians. Queensland police would be immediately dismissed if sentenced to imprisonment under new bill Queensland’s police minister, Mark Ryan, has introduced a bill to allow “the immediate dismissal” of police officers and recruits who are sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal offence. The minister said the legislation would change the current situation where a police officer may be imprisoned but not dismissed from the service until all criminal appeals have ended and a police disciplinary investigation is finalised. “The examples that we have heard during the public hearings of the commission of inquiry are completely unacceptable ... For people who do the wrong thing there is no place for them in the Queensland police service.” The proposed legislation comes after the state’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, conceded the current police disciplinary system is “broken” during an independent commission of inquiry. The inquiry heard a number of officers who had sexually assaulted junior colleagues had not been dealt with appropriately and instead were subjected to “local managerial resolution” – a remedial conversation with a supervisor. Ryan said the application of LMRs is governed by QPS policy and had already been addressed by the police commissioner. However, he said the government will “carefully consider” any recommendations from the commission of inquiry about the police discipline system and “will consult all stakeholders about any need for legislative amendments during this term of government.” The inquiry will hand its final report to the state government on 14 November. Shoot for the moon – worst-case scenario, you land on a piece of SpaceX space junk. About 223,000 Medlab Pathology customers had their personal information including health records, credit card numbers and Medicare numbers exposed in a cyber-attack in February, the company’s parent company, Australian Clinical Labs, has informed the Australian Stock Exchange. Medlab says the breach mostly affects people in NSW and Queensland, and the records exposed of most concern are: 17,539 individual medical and health records associated with a pathology test. 28,286 credit card numbers and individual names. Of these cards, 15,724 have expired, but 3,375 of the cards have the CVV code. 128,608 Medicare numbers and names. Medlab said it became aware of unauthorised third-party access to its system in February, and at the time external forensic specialists did not find evidence that information had been compromised. But in March, the Australian Cyber Security Centre contacted the company and said it had intelligence that Medlab may have been the victim of a ransomware attack. The company again said it did not believe any data was compromised. In June, ACSC contacted the company again to say that it believed Medlab data had been posted on the dark web. Medlab then found and downloaded the data, which the company said was “highly complex and unstructured” and then made attempts to remove it from the dark web permanently. The company has blamed the complexity and unstructured nature of the data for it taking so long to report publicly. NSW farmers and environment groups call for resumption of feral animal culls There are calls for the NSW government to resume culling of feral pests in the state’s national parks over concerns a five-week suspension has put ecosystems at risk. The state government put a temporary suspension in place while it reviewed safety practices after concerns were raised about a deer cull earlier this year in the Kosciuszko national park. That suspension was applied to all culling programs in all parks across the state, prompting concerns from environment groups and the NSW Farmers Association. The Invasive Species Council has called on the government to lift the suspension because the wet weather could lead to “exploding” numbers of feral animals in national parks. The council’s advocacy manager, Jack Gough, said: More feral horses, pigs and deer trashing our parks and adjoining areas will be a disaster for our native wildlife and ecosystems. He said the ban would also be alarming for farmers concerned about “foot and mouth disease preparedness as feral pigs and deer will be major spreaders of the disease if it reaches our shores”. Reg Kidd, a member of the NSW Farmers conservation and resource management committee, told The Sydney Morning Herald “we were flabbergasted to learn the government had put a stop to controlling feral animals in national parks”. He said: Putting a stop to feral animal control is irresponsible as it will impact the public, nature and private landowners such as farmers. The government says the suspension has only affected shooting operations. Other invasive species controls such as baiting and trapping have continued. A spokesperson for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said the agency will “always prioritise public safety” and the review was to ensure operations were being conducted with the highest safety standards. They said completion of the review was imminent and feral animal shooting operations were expected to recommence with “even stronger safety protocols” within the next week. The women’s budget statement event has been held. Mike Bowers was there: NSW and Victoria announce joint funding for $558m redevelopment of Albury Base hospital Tamsin Rose and Benita Kolovos report on what is happening on the border of Vic and NSW: The premiers of New South Wales and Victoria have announced a joint plan to fund a $558m redevelopment of the Albury Base hospital in a bid to improve healthcare for people living in the border region. The announcement, from two leaders on opposite sides of the political aisle who have developed a strong history of collaboration, comes a month out from the Victorian state election and four months ahead of the NSW state poll. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the project served as a “great example of cooperation across political lines” to get results for people in the border region. His Victorian counterpart, Daniel Andrews, added that it was important to ensure community members and healthcare professionals “have the facilities they need”. Premier Perrottet dismissed suggestions that the announcement was a political stunt ahead the state elections both premiers face. He said: Dan and I work closely together. It’s not about politics. It’s about actually getting the job done and working together to achieve great things for our state. The elections are irrelevant. It’s not about that, it’s about our people and being focused on this. Both states will chip in $225m for the redevelopment, in addition to the $108m already allocated by the NSW and commonwealth governments, with construction to begin next year. It is slated to be completed by 2027. Energy ministers prepare to meet in Melbourne As energy ministers prepare to jet into Melbourne (offsetting the carbon, we trust), the various ministers are honing their pitches. As noted in an earlier post, lowering energy prices will be high on the discussion agenda. Since the last such gathering in August, we’ve had some big announcements from Queensland and Victoria (as astutely summarised in this article by Graham Readfearn). Public ownership has certainly loomed larger of late, particularly in Victoria, with its revival of the State Electricity Commission (as we explored here). Queensland’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, also laid out here the benefits of controlling most of the electricity generators and the handy use of a levy on windfall coal profits to give rebates to households. Anyway, de Brenni tells us today that “the best path to secure lower prices is energy independence through more renewable energy”, in comments that probably all of the attending energy ministers will agree on. However, he couldn’t resist a serve at his Coalition counterparts, saying that policy instability over the past decade has been a big part of our present woes. Had the previous federal LNP government delivered a cogent policy to encourage renewables, Australia wouldn’t be so exposed to the volatility of global fossil fuel markets. You could generate more clean energy shuffling your feet down a carpeted hallway than Angus Taylor and the federal LNP delivered in over a decade. And the cheaper medicines bill is also getting through the parliament. Mark Butler will be holding a press conference on that at 12.30 The Senate is pushing through its legislation agenda: And for a temperature check on that, in case you missed it, here is Murph: Chalmers: electricity market not resilient and robust due to ‘decade of policy failures’ Given electricity prices and the $275 savings by 2025 promise will undoubtably feature in Peter Dutton’s budget reply speech, here is what Jim Chalmers had to say about it this morning on ABC Radio RN: I think the full impact of the war in Ukraine is starting to be felt when it comes to electricity prices. We didn’t have these forecasts obviously, which are relatively new forecasts for electricity prices. We didn’t have them in May, of course. But I think people do understand around the community that the war in Ukraine is causing havoc. It’s pushing up electricity prices, and our electricity market here is not as resilient and robust as we need it to be because we’ve had a decade of policy failure. Q: But given the invasion of Ukraine occurred by the May election campaign, shouldn’t Labor have known its modelling was out of date? Chalmers: That’s because it goes to the fundamental fact here – which is renewable energy is not just cleaner energy, it’s also cheaper energy – that is the near unanimous view of investors and economists and others. That remains the case. There’s basically three facts here: first of all, renewable energy is cheaper energy. Secondly, the war in Ukraine is causing havoc and pushing up electricity prices. And, thirdly, the fact that our predecessors had more than 20 energy policies and pulled more capacity out of the system than they put in has made us more vulnerable to these global price shocks. If you haven’t read this yet, you should: Sussan Ley says tax cuts are good and IR reforms are not Sussan Ley, who as the deputy opposition leader has been handed the mantle of chief government attacker (the leaders like to keep their hands mostly clean from political attacks so voters don’t view them as too negative – this is a cross party tactic), says she thinks the industrial relations system is not broken and the stage-three tax cuts will help workers: No, the system is not broken and it’s no excuse to introduce pattern bargaining across this country which allows people in businesses in Western Australia who have a completely unrelated set of circumstances in which they operate their business as employees to somehow be included with businesses and workers on the east coast. It actually doesn’t make any sense at all. In fact, it makes the system more inflexible. What this is, is this government taking industrial relations system back to the 1970s* and not having at its centre productivity in the workplace or a focus on increasing jobs and security for both employees and employers. And you know, what if this government cares about the wages of workers, what it could do is guarantee the stage three tax cuts today, because everyone earning $45,000 or more gets help. The stage three tax cuts will put more money in workers’ pockets** and give them the support that they need when they plan for the future. *That would actually be impossible, given the low union membership, the Fair Work Commission and the fact that the conditions are completely different. We are not in stagflation, company profits have continued upwards, and work conditions are very, very different. **If they earn over $180,000. Sussan Ley says government’s IR legislation will ‘take us back decades’ The Liberal MP is not a fan of the industrial relations bill: Let’s look at the detail, but what this is a rushed introduction of legislation that takes us back decades under the cover of the budget this week. That’s what this is. It could not come at a worse time for businesses who are struggling with staff shortages, who are struggling with increasing costs, for manufacturers they’re looking at power prices that are almost unaffordable. This government does not have their back. This pattern style, industry wide bargaining will increase strike action*. In fact, when asked to guarantee that it wouldn’t this morning on breakfast radio the industrial relations minister couldn’t do that. They also refused to say when it would increase workers’ wages. What this is, is the Labor party looking after the unions, making sure that they keep their promises to their union mates. *In terms of strike action, it pays to put the Australian experience in context – strike action is almost non-existent in this country now. It is at historic lows, along with union membership. Meanwhile, there is still a major focus on health funding – and what will happen when the 50-50 hospital funding deal expires. People living in poverty far more vulnerable to domestic violence, research shows While the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave (to start from next year) is a good start, it is also worth remembering people living in poverty are particularly vulnerable. Last week was Anti-Poverty Week. The Anti-Poverty Week website resources include these facts: New research from the Life Course Centre found young Australian women (aged 21-28 years) in financial hardship are more than 3 times as likely to report being the victim of past-year severe partner abuse: 9.3% compared with 2.9% for those not experiencing financial hardship. The rates were also around double for any partner abuse or unwanted sexual activity. Rates of violence are higher for groups that face multiple forms of discrimination, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women with disability, older women, women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds including women on temporary visas, and those in the LGBTIQA+ community. Women from refugee backgrounds are particularly at risk of financial abuse and reproductive coercion. …and poverty can deter women from leaving Australian Women Against Violence Alliance have estimated that. on average, it costs $18,000 for a victim/survivor to leave a violent relationship and establish safety. This includes costs associated with reallocation, safety upgrades and legal and medical costs Breaking into the political news to update you on the Bruce Lehrmann trial. Chris Knaus reports: The entire jury in the trial of Bruce Lehrmann has been discharged after a juror was found to have conducted their own research and brought outside material into the jury room. The ACT supreme court convened on Thursday morning and heard that a juror had conducted research outside the courtroom, contrary to their oath. Chief justice Lucy McCallum said she had no choice but to discharge one of the 12 jurors. She said that meant she had to discharge them all. Paul Karp is looking through the IR legislation and has found where the conflict will be: Power prices on the agenda when ministers meet on Friday Not the biggest surprise, but energy affordability – along with supply and reliability – will head the agenda for the federal, state and territory ministers when they gather in Melbourne on Friday. Chris Bowen, the federal minister for climate change and energy, told Guardian Australia that work on the National Energy Transformation Partnership aimed at supporting “the smooth transformation of Australia’s energy sector” will also be on the agenda. There’s no mention of the provision of rebates for energy as proposed by NSW’s treasurer Matt Kean, who will be only one of two Liberals in the room. (Guy Barnett should be the other. Along with premier of Tasmania, he has a few hats, including water and veteran affairs...so he must be taking part in federal gatherings every other week.) Bowen’s line is that: “We are now building on this reform program with all jurisdictions to deliver much needed long-term certainty to industry and investors to put downward pressure on prices and ensure reliability of the system.” That pressure is not yet having the desired effect, it should be said. Anyway, as for the size of the power prices rises in the budget, Bowen makes it clear that the first instalment of those 20% and 30% has already taken effect. (The budget wasn’t clear.) “The budget shows that treasury has assumed retail electricity prices have already increased by an average of 20% nationally in 2022-23,” he said. “This largely reflects increases that took effect in the September quarter, including the increase to the Default Market Offer that the former government hid before the election.” If you want to more about that hiding, here’s our story back in May: The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, has introduced Labor’s wide-ranging industrial relations bill which improves access to flexible work and removes hurdles to multi-employer bargaining. Burke told the House of Representatives that Australia’s workplace laws “are not up to date”, warning the opposition that, given the cost of living crisis is the gap between incomes and rising prices, they “can’t claim to care about cost of living if [they] support continued wage stagnation”. Burke said that adding gender equity as an object of the Fair Work Act would help close the “unacceptable” gender pay gap of 14.1%, while the bill would remove “insurmountable hurdles” to getting equal pay orders, such as childcare workers who lost a case because they couldn’t fulfil the “impossible task” of finding a male comparator group. Burke said: These reforms are intended to reverse decades of unfair outcomes for women. It will no longer be necessary to establish sex discrimination to prove work has been undervalued.” The bill also contains an “express prohibition” against workplace sexual harassment, and bolsters existing anti-discrimination protections. With curbs on rolling fixed term contracts, the bill will help employees experiencing the “permanent probation period”, he said. The bill’s most controversial changes are to make multi-employer bargaining significantly easier to access, but Burke presented them as incremental changes to existing streams of bargaining. Burke said under existing single-interest bargaining, parties need to get his permission to bargain together, a form of red tape that will be removed. Employers must have clearly identifiable common interests and FWC must be satisfied it is in the public interest,” he said, suggesting the reform will help businesses compete on innovation and service not “who can pay the lowest wage”. Burke also noted consultation is ongoing and didn’t rule out further amendments to better implement safeguards which include guaranteeing that single-employer agreements are still available, and that multi-employer deals are “not extended to those industries where it is not appropriate or not necessary such as commercial construction”. Burke said the bill will give the Fair Work Commission power to resolve “intractable disputes through arbitration” where there is “no prospect” of agreement. This will encourage good faith bargaining and quick resolution of disputes. Agreements signed under the Coalition’s WorkChoices laws will be sunsetted, “businesses need to pay minimum entitlements in awards, to benefit workers and level the playing field”, he said. Changes to the better off overall test will mean the commission uses “actual workers and patterns of work that are foreseeable” to judge a pay deal, taking a “global rather than line by line” approach. If employers and employees agree a pay deal passes the test, the commission will give “primary consideration” to their view. If circumstances change, a pay deal can be reassessed. “This makes sure that no worker will be worse off,” Burke said. And on wages ... There is an event around the woman’s budget statement a little later this morning. Anthony Albanese will deliver a speech at about 10.30am. Big shake up, small turnout in the House as IR bill is introduced Mike Bowers was in the chamber to capture the introduction of legislation for the biggest IR shake up in more than a decade – but most of the opposition was not. Tony Burke commends the bill to the house: This bill delivers on the government’s commitment to ensure a fairer workplace relations system that provides Australians with job security, gender equity and sustainable wage growth. This bill will not fix every problem in our workplace relations system, but it’s a strong start, and it will provide a strong foundation on which we can continue to build a fairer and more equitable system Australians need, want and deserve. Now there will be requests for us to move more slowly, to wait extra months to pretend that there is no urgency as this bill proceeds through the House and in the other place. I asked members and senators to remember how long people have already waited – they have waited a decade, while wages were kept deliberately low. Waited generations while the gender pay gap refused to close, waited while children became adults, while caring responsibilities collided with rosters, waited in insecure work for the secure job, which still hasn’t arrived. These Australians have waited long enough. And while waiting, they have turned up every day and done their job. It’s now time we did ours and legislated for secure jobs and better pay. I commend the build the house. Tony Burke says the IR legislation will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This isn’t new – it was one of Labor’s stated aims since it was introduced. But this line of his speech still gets applause from the government side of the chamber. This bill will abolish the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission. The Fair Work Ombudsman will have carriage of all industries. Family violence leave also applies to casuals, Tony Burke says Family and domestic violence paid leave should be in place at most workplaces from 1 February next year, for most employees. Small businesses get an extra six months to adjust to the new workplace entitlement, so it will be August 2023 for those workers. Tony Burke says it also applies to casuals: Family and domestic violence leave has to be a universal entitlement. Women can be victims of domestic violence no matter what job they work, how long they’ve been in that job, what sort of agreement they’re on or how many hours a week they work. In fact, women who are experiencing family and domestic violence are more likely to be employed in casual and insecure work. We can’t leave them behind. Violence doesn’t discriminate – and neither should the law. Greens welcome domestic violence leave but say more funding needed for women’s safety The Greens have welcomed the passing of the family and domestic violence paid leave legislation. But Larissa Waters also pointed out last night that there is no new funding for frontline responses in the budget: Paid Family and Domestic Violence (FDV) leave will help victim-survivors, who are predominantly women, to escape abusive relationships, protect themselves and their children, and rebuild their lives. But paid FDV leave cannot succeed if advice and support services for victim-survivors and employers don’t have funding to meet demand. The long-awaited National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children has now been released, but without any new funding commitments. The women’s safety sector has repeatedly called for a $1B per year investment to ensure funding meets demand. And yet the government’s budget response was to re-badge and re-shuffle previous funding commitments, adding only partial indexation and a fraction of the workers needed, with the Labor government instead choosing tax cuts for the rich and subsidies for donor mates. You can read more about the flexible work component here: As usual, Paul Karp has been all over this What will the industrial relations bill do? Tony Burke’s office is on it – here is part of the release which lays out what the government says this bill will do: The Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill will: - Help close the 14.1 per cent gender pay gap and protect women in the workplace by: putting gender equity at the heart of the Fair Work Commission’s decision-making; boosting the Commission’s gender pay gap expertise; banning pay secrecy clauses; expanding access to flexible work arrangements; and expressly prohibiting sexual harassment in the Fair Work Act. - Improve job security by placing new limits on rolling fixed term contracts so workers can’t be effectively put on an endless probation period. - Protect workers by: bolstering their ability to recover unpaid entitlements under the Fair Work small claims system; banning job ads that advertise for below the relevant minimum pay rate; and closing a loophole to protect firefighters in the ACT. - Return fairness to the workplace by abolishing the politicised, discredited and unnecessary Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission. -Modernise the bargaining system by expanding access to enterprise bargaining and multi-employer bargaining; reforming the Better Off Overall Test so it’s simple, flexible and fair; making it easier to initiate bargaining; giving the Fair Work Commission new powers to resolve long-running intractable disputes; and terminating WorkChoices-era “zombie” agreements. IR bill will improve gender equality and help stop sexual harassment, Burke says In the chamber, Tony Burke says with this IR bill, all the Respect at Work report legislative recommendations are now before the parliament. Workers who want to have a discussion about pay equity at work should not be prohibited by their employment contracts when doing so. This bill will prohibit pay secrecy clauses bringing transparency to workplaces critically, this bill protects workers by saying if you want to tell people how much you are paid that is up to you. Stamping out workplace sexual harassment is central to achieving safe, productive and gender equitable workplaces. Under the previous government’s laws, there was no express prohibition on sexual harassment under the Fair Work Act and stopped sexual harassment orders were only available to some workers. We will fix these issues. Our changes mean whether you’re a nurse in Tamworth, a plumber in Perth or an office worker in Canberra, you can ask the Fair Work Commission to deal quickly and effectively with your complaint of sexual harassment in the Fair Work Commission. Whether the harassment occurred in the past or is ongoing or both. The new provisions will also allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate and assist with compliance. These changes send a clear message that workplace sexual harassment will not be tolerated. These reforms fully implement recommendation 28 of the respect at work report, complementing the attorney general’s proposed reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act. This bill means that all legislative changes recommended by respect at work are now before the parliament. Burke says IR bill won’t create more industrial action from workers Tony Burke was pressed this morning on whether multi-employer bargaining would lead to more industrial action. He was asked by Patricia Karvelas: “The big concern from business groups is that this will lead to a lot more industrial action. Is that ultimately where this will end?” Burke: Australia has low rates of industrial action, and that won’t change. That won’t change. Karvelas: But this opens the door to it changing? Burke: Well, no, no, no. Because you can already have industrial action on a single-employer agreement. What we are doing, though – and I think what has really frustrated people – is that when you get this long, protracted industrial action, including in single employer agreements, at the moment those long disputes have no way of being resolved. And we’re introducing, when the commission believes it has become intractable, that you can now have arbitration where they look at – ‘OK, here are the issues that have been agreed. Here are the issues that haven’t been agreed. Let’s sort it out.’ And that way the long, protracted, neverending disputes, which are often the ones in the media, they should become much less common. I’m hoping they become a thing of the past. Karvelas: Okay, but clearly though you’re saying, you know, we have low industrial action, and that’s right. This allows for industrial action across workplaces, does it not? That is the ultimate consequence of this bill. Burke: That’s right, but the rules in being able to do it are no different to what they would be if you were doing a single-employer negotiation. Karvelas: Sure, but all of a sudden you have a lot more workers striking potentially. Burke: Look, there are lots of forms of industrial action and lots of them much more lowkey than that. The big difference here – well, first of all, before any industrial action – even single – at the moment you can go – you go straight to it after you’ve had your vote of workers. There’ll now be compulsory conciliation to try to sort these disputes out. That may of itself across the board put real downward pressure on industrial action because we get issues solved first. And then if they’re continuing arbitration, which has not been there before, becomes available. It’s a much more sensible outcome. A crucial review of the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) is expected to make recommendations to the Albanese government well before it hands down its final report next year. The review, to be led by chair Bruce Bonyhady and experienced public servant Lisa Paul, is shaping up as pivotal to the future of the scheme and the hundreds of thousands of participants who rely on it, following Tuesday’s budget forecasts. The government also announced a major crackdown on NDIS fraud in the budget, tipped to rake in about $200m, but it has acknowledged the review is looking into reform of the scheme, including to make it more “sustainable”. The budget forecast the total cost of federal, state and territory funding for the NDIS is expected to increase from $35bn this year to $52bn in 2025-26, an $8.8bn increase compared to the figures in the May budget. Queensland’s disability services minister, Craig Crawford, told Guardian Australia disability ministers were “all concerned about the fiscal risk in the projected funding for NDIS over coming years”. “But the cost blowouts need to be managed without stopping new entrants coming onto the scheme that deserve to be there. “Queensland also welcomes the crackdown on fraud and cowboy operators.” The NSW disability services minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, told Guardian Australia fraud in the scheme was a “significant concern” and the disability ministers agreed “more needs to be done in this space”. “The NSW Government will continue to work with the Commonwealth and other states and territories to ensure that the NDIS is sustainable and delivers as intended for people with disability.” A Victorian government spokesperson told Guardian Australia the review was an “important opportunity to examine key issues underlying the scheme to ensure it operates as originally intended”. Disability groups warned discussion around cost must also consider the social and economic benefits, pointing to a Per Capita report which found every $1 spent on the scheme spurned $2.25 in economic activity. Ross Joyce, the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations, told Guardian Australia the funds provided to NDIS participants were not “squirrelled away” by people with disability. “They are putting money back into the economy to pay for the supports they need to live an ordinary life,” he said. Joyce also argued the NDIS was saving money in other areas such as health and mental health, but those savings were not easily calculated. The workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, is now introducing the industrial relations bill. He says Australia’s IR system is no longer working and it is beyond time to change it. But he says this bill, if passed, won’t be able to solve issues like wage growth overnight. Australians have asked for change. They’ve asked for less conflict and fairer pay. They’ve asked for a better future for themselves and for their families. It will take time for this bill to result in improvements in workplaces and pay increases in the pockets of Australians. So we cannot waste a moment in passing it. The family and domestic violence leave bill is passed on the voices. Workers will now be able to access 10 days of paid leave if they are in a family or domestic violence situation. There is applause in the house. The plan for parliament today The parliament is sitting. Tony Burke is up and he is laying out the day’s business. Peter Dutton gets the budget reply this evening (about 7.30pm). And it looks like the family and domestic violence leave is one of the first issues of the House (the Senate sat late last night to pass it). So it is back in the house for the amendments to be passed. (The amendments are agreed to by the government, so this will be quick) After that, we are going straight into industrial relations. Ley says Morrison government handed over ‘strong economy’ and Labor ‘haven’t got a plan’ Sussan Ley was very critical of the government’s budget on Sky News this morning and was asked what she believed the answers were. She said: Well, we aren’t the government, we handed the government a strong economy. In fact, Jim Chalmers said, when we handed down our budget ‘what we need is a plan to tackle the sting of inflation’. So where is his plan? What’s he doing? Where is the reassurance that Australians need that things will start to get better? They will only feel that if they know this government has a plan. Now, in terms of what to do, Pete, there are many things. We made affordable power prices a priority when we were in government. We understood that that’s the perspective that you have to have when you look at this issue, so that we don’t find that people can’t afford to turn on the coolers, or turn on the heaters, or run their manufacturing equipment in their businesses. Now, that’s not the approach this government has had. They’ve talked to the game on renewables, but they haven’t realised the cost. They haven’t realised, for example, that more supply into the market makes sense. They haven’t got a plan. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi will give notice of a private senator’s bill she will introduce today aiming to halt the indexation on student loans and increase the repayment threshold to above the median wage. Faruqi says it is one way which would help ease the cost of living burden on people with student debt: Student debt is no small problem. About three million people in Australia have the burden of student debt. At a time when the cost of living is biting hard, governments can no longer ignore the student debt crisis and its impacts. Study debts are impacting people’s ability to obtain loans, their mental health, their ability to save up to buy a home or simply afford to live a good life. Scrapping indexation on HELP debts and raising the minimum repayment threshold will provide much needed money in people’s pockets to make ends meet or pay rent. Faruqi says higher education should be free and this legislation is one step in that direction and has challenged the Labor government to work with the Greens “to wind back Liberal era policies which have saddled people with more debt that takes longer and longer to pay off”. And this is what Jennifer Westacott, the head of Business Council, had to say about industrial relations in an interview with Ausbiz yesterday: What we have said all the time is that we want wages to grow, and we want them to stay growing. Not to have a short-term growth and then have at the expense of potentially higher unemployment. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is we’ve got to get an IR system that drives productivity. That’s not about working harder for less, it’s about working smarter. It’s about creating the environment where people use new technology, where they innovate, where they share ideas, where they open new markets, where they have more skilled people. It’s about creating value by doing things differently. That requires a collaborative workplace at an enterprise level. We want to see the enterprise bargaining system revitalised. What we don’t want to see is more complexity. What we don’t want to see is industry-wide bargaining, which we think will really hurt productivity, and in the long term, hurt wages growth. What we don’t want to see is widespread industrial action. We hear a lot of the unions saying what we want out of this reform is the capacity for widespread industrial action. The community doesn’t want that and our economy is too fragile, to really take rolling strikes like we had in 1983. So that’s IR. Then we’ve really got to have a mature conversation about tax reform. We try to do this in this country, every time we do, someone shuts it down, and we never make any progress. The simple reality is we’ve got a spending and a revenue problem. The third thing we have to do, which is not a matter for business, but the matter for government, but it’s hugely important, is control spending in those areas like NDIS. Control spending in health, not by cutting costs, but by getting better outcomes. That’s going to require investment in technology, workforce, and so on. We’ve got to be willing to tackle red tape and the micro-economic reform that needs to be done, that gets rid of all the friction in the economy. We’ve got to stay on course for the migration targets that we welcome in the budget last night. So, there’s a lot of stuff to do. To be honest, we can’t wait for the May budget to get on with some of it but get on with it we have to. Because we’re looking around the world and you’ve just been reporting on this. You’ve got the UK in a political and economic crisis. What does that mean? Well, it means tough times for people living in the UK. We don’t want that for Australians. It is fair to say that business is not too happy with multi-employer bargaining. Or that they are yet to see the industrial relations bill. The warnings that people will lose their jobs have already begun. But on the flip side, wages haven’t increased in about a decade, union membership has fallen and the idea we might see the wildcat strikes of the 1970s given the Fair Work hoops seems wildly over inflated. Here is what Sally McManus has to say about it. She told the ABC: At the moment we’ve got a situation where the wages are moving for CEOs. They went up 40% this year . Productivity, labour productivity has gone up 13% and workers have seen less than 1% of that. Clearly there’s a problem at the moment. Like when the economy is good, workers don’t get pay rises. When the economy is bad, it’s the same thing. So, I mean, clearly there’s a big problem in terms of the underlying structure of our bargaining system and that’s what we’ve got to fix. If we’ve people on a more equal footing you get better outcomes, it’s a pretty straightforward solution to it by doing that. We like to see more co-operation in the country. We would like to see businesses recognising they can’t have their employees, the workers of this country, the people who spend in small businesses, in a situation where wages have been held down for so long and unfairly. Meanwhile, Murph has a reality check on how we ended up where we have with energy prices. In the Senate yesterday, Greens senator Lidia Thorpe spoke about the death of 15-year-old Noongar boy Cassius Turvey, who was killed as he walked home from school. A man has been charged, but police investigations are continuing. Today I rise for a 15-year-old First Nations child, Cassius Turvey. Cassius Turvey was a loved member of the Noongar community who ran his own lawn-mowing business and would let community members decide how much they could pay him. On 13 October, Cassius was returning home from school when he allegedly was viciously beaten with a pole. He passed away eight days later. When a First Nations child is born, they inherit and learn cultural wisdom, knowledge and strength. Our families gather and we wrap our arms around our babies, knowing that they’re our dreaming children. Their blood line is their birthright. This is our children’s land. It is their country, and they’re guided by our ancestors. If only it were a reality that our children could live out their birthright in this country; that they would live a journey of peace, culturally and spiritually safe. No Aboriginal child should be robbed of their birthright in so-called Australia. Our Dreaming child, Cassius, fell victim to a monster—a monster far greater than those who (allegedly) racially targeted and killed Cassius. The monster is the unresolved violent legacy of white Australia. To Cassius’s family, friends and community: I’m sorry. To black Australia: I’m sorry. I am sorry that we are here again with yet another justice hashtag for the loss of another black life. No black child should fear walking home from school and no black mother should wonder if their child will return home. We all must fight for a country where First Nations children like Cassius can live out their birthright. Cassius: may you rest as we rise and continue the fight. Rod Sims thinks Labor should threaten gas companies with export limits No one in the government is saying yet what they will be doing about energy prices, but the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head has waded in with some thoughts: “Has anyone wrangled a camel before?” a member of the Foxtrot One in-water rescue team asks apprehensively from the boat. “Ah, it’s domesticated,” another member, Anthony Walgate, reassures him. Fire and Rescue NSW yesterday afternoon carried out a “humpday” operation to rescue a domesticated camel stranded in floodwaters of the Murray River near Moama. The emergency authority said: Gina the domestic camel had wandered off from her small herd on the property towards the river, ignoring repeated attempts by her owner to coax her away from the water’s edge. The local resident was concerned because camels cannot swim Wading through the river up to their chests, the specially-trained rescue technicians used hay to lure Gina out of the floodwater and back to dry land. She was soon returned to the herd unharmed. For the Fire and Rescue NSW crew, their ‘dromedary’ drama was done and dusted. These firefighters adding ‘Camel Wrangling’ to their long list of rescue capabilities. The defence minister Richard Marles is speaking about Australian troops being sent to help train Ukraine forces. Daniel Hurst has you covered on that. Chalmers slip up – after a question he says he misheard – makes headlines Jim Chalmers is still doing the media rounds and he’s sounding a little tired. Yesterday he made his first misstep – he misheard a question at the press club about whether Labor stood by its $275 lower power bills election promise and the treasurer said yup, it’s in the budget. In question time he said he had contacted the journalist who asked it immediately after to say he misheard the question and thought he had been asking something else. His mistake is the front page of the Daily Telegraph today. But the focus is what is the government going to do to lower electricity prices. Chalmers said he isn’t going to pre-empt what the government’s consultation brings, but intervention into the market is one of the things under consideration. Happy budget reply day to those who celebrate. Peter Dutton will deliver his first budget reply speech at about 7.30pm (the same time the treasurer delivered his on Tuesday) where the opposition will lay out its plan to deal with Australia’s cost of living issues. Although you’ll probably hear a lot about the government’s lack of a plan, based on the criticisms from the opposition so far. But before then, the parliament has to get through a busy day of trying to pass as much legislation as possible, given there are only a handful of sitting weeks left until the end of the year. The Senate agreed to sit later last night so there might be a few cranky heads in the red chamber this morning. The main legislative game today will be the introduction of the government’s industrial relations bill, where a fight is looming over multi-employer bargaining. It’s a fight Tony Burke seems to be itching to have, and part of a plan to try to lift wages across the country. The bill is also aiming for more flexible work options for people who might need it. It’s a pretty big shake up of the industrial system and business is not on board for all of it. Neither is the opposition. Hence the brewing fight. And of course, there is also energy and what the government is going to do about future price increases. After yesterday’s inflation numbers and treasury’s forecasts, people want answers. We’ll bring you all of it as it happens. You have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst leading the way and Mike Bowers taking you into the hallways and chambers. Amy Remeikis will be on the blog for most of the day. I’ve already had three coffees and don’t know what today will bring. Maybe a cupcake for breakfast. It seems necessary. Ready? Let’s get into it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T08:29:45Z","webTitle":"Australia will put nuclear safety ‘above all else’ as it builds submarines, vice admiral says ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/australia-will-put-safety-above-all-else-as-it-builds-nuclear-powered-submarines-vice-admiral-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia will put nuclear safety “above all else” as it begins the “generational challenge” of building and operating nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact, the government’s top adviser has said. V Adm Jonathan Mead has moved to allay concerns – both at home and across the region – about nuclear safety as Australia, the US and the UK prepare to announce their detailed plans within days. The head of the Australian government’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce has also insisted that the likely presence of American and British personnel on Australian boats would not inhibit Australian command and control. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Mead said there were likely to be more Australians onboard British and American nuclear-powered submarines as part of the training process. He said as many as 40 Australians may potentially be onboard a US submarine at any one time. The US president, Joe Biden, is due to welcome the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the British PM, Rishi Sunak, to the US for a joint announcement early next week about the practicalities of Australia acquiring at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mead, who leads a taskforce of more than 350 Australian officials who have been working on the plans, said this would be “a generational challenge for Australia and will probably redefine Australia’s strategic personality”. But he sought to reassure partners in south-east Asia and the Pacific about Australia’s intentions. “I can give them a commitment that we will hold the standards of safety above all else,” Mead said on Wednesday. “Look at the track record of US and UK nuclear submarines previously, look at Australia’s own track record in the way we manage our research reactor at Lucas Heights, and the way that we have managed visiting nuclear-powered ships and submarines over the past 60 years.” Mead described nuclear safety as “the No 1 consideration as we build, operate, maintain and regulate the nuclear powered submarines”. This would include safety of the submarine crew, safety of the community, and environmental protection. He said Australia had received “a very clear message from the US and the UK that safety is paramount” but added: “I think the Australian people would absolutely expect that, so we’re going to make sure that we set a gold standard when it comes to safety.” ‘Welded, shielded and sealed’ for 33 years Some nuclear experts have argued the Aukus arrangement depends on “a glaring and worrying loophole” in safeguards that could be exploited by others. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) does not ban non-nuclear weapon countries such as Australia from having nuclear-powered naval vessels. The Chinese government has also sought to sow doubt about Aukus, arguing the deal would have “a grave nuclear proliferation risk and violates the object and purpose of the NPT”. But Mead said each nuclear reactor would “come to us welded, shielded and sealed” and Australia was in continuing dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency. He said they were making “excellent progress” on an inspection and verification regime, while acknowledging the need “to protect very sensitive technology of the US and UK”. “Nuclear-powered submarines are not prohibited under the NPT,” Mead said. “Yes, the reactors will be with highly enriched uranium. But once again, they are welded, shielded and sealed for the life of the reactor. That’s 33 years. “We will implement the most stringent of security protocols to make sure that those reactors are not opened for the life of the submarine.” Sovereign control Mead was tight-lipped about the design of the submarine, the timeframes and the cost – all of which will be announced soon. But he again defended the plans against concerns raised by former prime ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating over their potential impact on Australian sovereignty. “When we take our own sovereign control, we will clearly have some US and UK sailors there – and they may be there to provide technical advice on the reactor, or they may be upfront working with us in the combat system,” Mead said. “We welcome that technical advice, we welcome subject matter expertise. And I think that we will continue to have US and UK people in our submarines, as we will have our own people onboard their submarines.” But Mead said such arrangements would not inhibit Australian command and control. “It doesn’t matter who is onboard. If that is an Australian flagged submarine with an Australian commanding officer, there is absolutely no ambiguity when it comes to sovereign control,” he said. Asked what would happen if that technical advice was withdrawn, Mead said Australia was determined to “develop a sovereign ability to build a nuclear-powered submarine, operate a nuclear-powered submarine, maintain a nuclear-powered submarine and regulate a nuclear-powered submarine”. “So there’s an expectation by our partners, and I think Australians would have an expectation, that we must be able to do this ourselves,” Mead said. “But yes, we will have assistance, something we have assistance with many of our major programs. The US and the UK will assist us and as we develop more and more understanding of the technology, then we would be probably have less of those people in Australia.” Mead said the looming announcement would show that the plans were “really a trilateral partnership” with the US and the UK, rather than a binary choice. He said his taskforce was working closely with the South Australian government and unions to develop a supply chain and vendor base in Australia that could feed into US and UK programs. On Wednesday the British high commissioner to Australia, Vicki Treadell, rebuked the Australian opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for saying the government should pursue US Virginia class submarines over a British alternative. Treadell said she had spoken with Dutton and told him he was “commenting on an outcome he doesn’t yet know”. She told the National Press Club: “I was simply pointing out that I did not think such expressions were helpful on what is a genuine trilateral partnership started under his government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T14:00:23Z","webTitle":"The Power of Trees by Peter Wohlleben review – let’s turn over a new leaf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/may/07/the-power-of-trees-peter-wohlleben-review-forests-climate","fields":{"bodyText":"Next time you’re walking through a park on a hot day, take a moment to sit under a big old tree. While you’re reclining under the shady boughs, you’ll find that the temperature is something like 2C cooler than if you were beneath a parasol. Why? Because a mature deciduous tree releases a massive amount of water from its leaves, which cools the surrounding air as it evaporates, just like the way sweating cools our bodies down. So a single tree influences the microclimate around it – but what about an entire forest? That’s the question explored in The Power of Trees by German forester Peter Wohlleben, whose 2015 book The Hidden Life of Trees was a surprise international bestseller. By way of an answer, Wohlleben whisks us to Berlin, where the average noon temperature in summer over a 15-year period was a stifling 33C. But travel a little further, to the bosky woods around the German capital, and the temperature drops sharply. This is because, we’re told, “beeches and oaks act like bodies of water”. The trees “cool the landscape so much that the temperature difference between a city like Berlin and an ancient woodland is about 15C.” Interestingly, homogenous pine plantations – of the kind being planted as “carbon sinks” – end up being 8C warmer on average than deciduous woodlands. As Wohllenben tartly observes: “The results make it clear that these dismal monocultures can never replace real forests.” But as the book explains, ancient glades don’t just cool the air around them; they also play an outsize role in our planet’s water cycle. A single beech tree can breathe out 500 litres of water a day, which creates a local low-pressure area that air is drawn into. “Forests suck fresh air from the oceans – and they do this over great distances,” writes Wohlleben. This damp oceanic air rises above forests, cools down, and then rains its moisture down on the trees. This means that chopping down forests has a profound – but sadly not widely recognised – impact on global rainfall. “If forests are cut down and replaced with, say, grass or croplands, rainfall could decrease by 90%,” the author writes, bluntly. This isn’t idle speculation. Droughts have been increasing in the Amazon as the coastal rainforest has been heartbreakingly logged and razed. Wohlleben writes in a sober style, but he can’t hide his anger with the way people today – including many environmentalists – now “think of trees as little more than biological storage units for carbon dioxide either while they are alive or, better yet, when they are dead”. This hellishly narrow perspective ignores the vast beneficial effects that forests – especially ancient forests – generate for global temperature management. Although the main thrust of the book is about the interplay between forests and the climate emergency, there are some fascinating detours along the way. I never knew, for example, that some trees can identify which little seedlings growing around them are their own offspring, and use their roots to feed their “kids” with a sugary solution. And I couldn’t help but be enthralled by the account of the ways trees learn from drought and other environmental shocks, and then behave very differently to trees that haven’t been through the same stresses. This book is wise and thought-provoking, even if at times the prose is as wooden as a lumberjack’s CV. Wohlleben reveals how we’re in the grip of an egomaniacal conceit that humans are somehow smarter than nature. As a result, too many politicians think the best approach to the environmental crisis is even more micromanagement and human control. A better idea would be to trust nature, giving the Earth’s complex ecosystems the space and time they need to heal. As the author drily concludes: “In view of the challenges we now face with climate change, more humility would be a fine thing.” The Power of Trees by Peter Wohlleben (translated by Jane Billinghurst) is published by Greystone (£18.99).

Recently she left the world of campaign politics and took a job as senior counsel for the non-profit Rewiring America. Her role will focus on helping thousands of people across America wean their homes and businesses off fossil fuels and on to electricity, at a moment when scientists have given a “final warning” about the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent global catastrophe. “We are at an inflection point where we can choose to electrify,” she said in an interview. “We don’t have to do it everywhere, all at once. If you want to see what the future looks like, we start building it here and now.” The impetus for her role comes from significant moves taken by the Biden administration. When he signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) last year, President Joe Biden hailed it as “the biggest step forward on climate ever”. It includes a sprawling array of tax credits, rebates and other incentives to help people electrify their lives. “The government has basically filled a bank account for you with thousands of dollars that will help you go electric,” Abrams said. Her mission is to help people access that so-called bank account. “You can improve your indoor air quality, make cooking quick and easy, make being cool in the summer and warm in the winter, and be more affordable,” Abrams said. “But we have to talk about it.” Abrams is perhaps best known for registering 800,000 voters in Georgia through her voting rights advocacy organization Fair Fight Action. She wants to use a similar playbook with electrification, and doing so could benefit many of the same people whose voices risked going unheard in elections. Low-income communities and communities of color have long had to contend with polluting, inefficient appliances. This has an impact on public health by increasing the risk of asthma and leads to higher utility bills that take a bigger bite out of households’ income. The IRA takes aim at some of those wrongs, with tax credits and rebates that can help those households swap in heat pumps, induction stoves and electric vehicles for their gas-powered counterparts. But figuring out what incentives you qualify for and how to access them can be involved, to say the least. While Rewiring America has a calculator that lets individuals suss out what IRA benefits they can snag, Abrams will be taking that and other tools to the community level. She highlighted how houses of worship could be prime places to talk about the IRA and a potential target for outreach. And she hopes to work with local leaders such as teachers, mayors and city council members to make the IRA a kitchen table issue. Enlisting them will, she hopes, eventually lead to neighbors talking to neighbors about how much money they saved on a new induction stove or how much more comfortable their home was during a heatwave thanks to a newly installed heat pump. “You meet people where they are, not where you want them to be,” she said. “That means understanding the lives they’re living and the questions they have and who they go to to talk about their questions.” While the IRA has the potential to be transformative, it’s also not enough to electrify every household in the country. The law has billions set aside for home upgrades, but more resources will be needed to achieve the Biden administration’s goal of reducing US emissions up to 52% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade. An analysis by the Rhodium Group found the law has the potential to cut emissions by up to 42%. And that it could reduce home energy bills by $717 to $1,146 by 2030. Abrams said that, based on her experience in the arena of voting rights, the prospect of such benefits could help foster an electrification movement. “As people get more, they expect more,” she said. “The most sustainable movement is when people expect more and are willing to work for more.” This isn’t Abrams’ first foray into climate. She was quick to point out her college senior thesis was on environmental justice and that she interned with the Environmental Protection Agency. During her tenure in the Georgia house of representatives, she also worked as minority leader to help pass a bill that included the state’s biggest influx of cash for public transportation. Ultimately, the Biden administration wants the US to reach net zero by mid-century. It might be hard to imagine that occurring – a distant future, when perhaps technologies that are only nascent today like carbon dioxide removal will be more widespread, almost every car and home will be electric, and the inequalities targeted by the IRA and Biden’s executive orders will have dwindled. That scenario can read a bit like science fiction – a genre of which Abrams is a well-known fan. “In almost every sci-fi story, it begins with what decisions people are making long before the story takes place,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-31T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"US debt ceiling: Republican hard-right vows to ‘do everything in our power’ to oppose bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/31/us-debt-ceiling-republican-hard-right-vows-to-sink-deal-hours-before-vote-expected","fields":{"bodyText":"Members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus have attacked the proposed spending cuts in the debt ceiling bill as woefully inadequate, and vowed to oppose the legislation when it hits the floor. “We had the time to act, and this deal fails – fails completely,” Representative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, chair of the Freedom Caucus, said on Tuesday. “We will do everything in our power to stop it and end it now.” The House is expected to hold a final vote on the bill on Wednesday, while other members of the Freedom Caucus continue to denounce the compromise brokered by the Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and President Joe Biden over the weekend. The compromise bill, formally named the Fiscal Responsibility Act, would suspend the debt ceiling until 2025, allowing the US to avoid a default that could reap devastating consequences on the American economy. The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has warned that the federal government will be unable to pay its bills starting on 5 June unless Congress takes action. In addition to the debt ceiling suspension, the bill includes government spending cuts and expanded work requirements demanded by McCarthy. “There has been a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights that have gone into changing the spending trajectory in this town,” Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, told reporters at the Capitol on Tuesday night. “For once in a long, long time, Washington is actually going to spend less money next year than it is this year, and that’s a reform that all of us can support.” Republicans on the House rules committee voted late on Tuesday to advance the bill, clearing the way for a final vote on Wednesday. During that hearing, two Freedom Caucus members who sit on the panel, Chip Roy of Texas and Ralph Norman of South Carolina, attempted to block the legislation from advancing, but they were outnumbered by their colleagues. The final vote in the rules committee was 7-6 to advance the bill, with four Democrats joining Roy and Norman in opposing the measure. “The Republican conference right now has been torn asunder,” Roy said ahead of the hearing. “Not one Republican should vote for this deal. It is a bad deal.” But the Republican chair of the rules committee, Tom Cole of Oklahoma, defended the bill as the party’s best possible option with Democrats in control of the White House and the Senate. “Today’s bill is a product of compromise that reflects the realities of a divided government,” Cole said at the hearing. “In a true negotiation, you always get less than you want and give up more than you’d like.” Despite reassurances from McCarthy and his allies, it remains unclear how many House Republicans will support the proposal. In addition to the Freedom Caucus, some of the more centrist members of the House Republican conference like representatives Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Wesley Hunt of Texas said they would vote against the bill. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, a member of the Freedom Caucus, predicted that most of the House Republican conference would oppose the legislation, forcing McCarthy to rely on Democrats to pass the bill. “This is a career-defining vote for every Republican,” Bishop said Tuesday. “This bill, if it passes, must pass with less than half of the Republican conference.” The House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, underscored the reality that Republicans must provide most of the 218 votes needed to get the bill approved. “This is an agreement that, at their insistence, they negotiated with the administration,” Jeffries said. “It’s our full and complete expectation that they are going to produce at least 150 votes.” Some House Democrats also appeared conflicted over the compromise measure on Tuesday, bemoaning the proposed spending cuts while emphasizing the crucial need to increase the government’s borrowing limit before 5 June. “There are some pros to the bill. The chief one is that it raises the debt limit to 2025 and ensures that we avoid a Republican-led catastrophic default,” Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on Tuesday. “I don’t want to minimize the challenges with the bill. There will be real harmful impacts for poor people and working people,” she added. Jayapal said her team was in the process of conducting a whip count to assess where progressive members stand on the debt ceiling bill, but it appears certain that the legislation will win bipartisan support in the House, as the center-left New Democrat Coalition has endorsed the proposal. If the bill passes the House, it will move on to the Senate, where lawmakers will have only a few days to approve the proposal before the 5 June default deadline. Even if McCarthy’s compromise can become law, the speaker’s troubles may be just beginning. Members of the Freedom Caucus, some of whom initially resisted McCarthy’s speakership bid in January, toyed with the idea of ousting him depending on the outcome of Wednesday’s vote. Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida told Newsmax on Tuesday, “If a majority of Republicans are against a piece of legislation, and you use Democrats to pass it, that would immediately be a black-letter violation of the deal we had with McCarthy to allow his ascent to the speakership, and it would likely trigger an immediate motion to vacate.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-labor-aukus-position-unions-mp-anthony-albanese","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T05:34:50Z","webTitle":"Labor thrashes out Aukus position at party conference amid dissent from MP and unions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-labor-aukus-position-unions-mp-anthony-albanese","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-labor-aukus-position-unions-mp-anthony-albanese","fields":{"bodyText":"There was a personal defence from Anthony Albanese. Aukus supporters lobbed claims of “appeasement” at its critics, which were angrily rejected by a Labor MP and leftwing unions. But in the end, Labor finally thrashed out its position on the Aukus nuclear-submarine acquisition. Late on Friday morning, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, sought to head off a party conference showdown, moving a 32-paragraph statement that argued spending $368bn on nuclear submarines would enhance Australia’s national security. After two days of tightly managed formalities marching through pre-agreed amendments, the 49th ALP national conference finally stubbed its toe on genuine dissent. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup From the conference floor, where the 399 voting delegates sit, came claps as Marles declared: “It’s Labor, it has always been Labor which is the true party of Australia’s national defence”. Marles set out the facts and figures, saying China had beefed up from six nuclear submarines in 2000 to 21 in 2030. Labor members are designated observers at the conference and sat further from the stage. But they shouted interjections at Marles and Conroy on behalf of the 50 branches or electorate councils that rejected nuclear waste and greater enmeshment with the US military industrial complex. While those members rejected as “rubbish” claims that Aukus is vital for national security and begged “don’t lead us into war”, delegates clapped as Conroy declared “strength deters war, appeasement invites conflict”. When pro-Aukus delegates were sick of the interjections one turned back towards the observers and shouted that they should “join the Greens”. In the most contentious section of the debate, Conroy evoked Robert Menzies “arguing for appeasement” and cutting defence spending while Labor’s John Curtin “argued for a massive increase in investment in our air force and navy to deter aggressors”. “So delegates: do you want to be on the side of John Curtin, or do you want to be on the side of pig iron Bob Menzies?,” Conroy said. The Labor MP Josh Wilson, already outspoken in his opposition to Aukus, was having none of that. With the greatest respect to Conroy, Wilson hit back that the accusations of “appeasement” levelled at those who question a “particular defence and security decision or acquisition” was “ridiculous”. “Deterrence is not a one-word justification for any and every defence acquisition. “And anyone who thinks the intention to extend the scope of one’s threat capacity only serves to reduce the potential for conflict has not looked very closely at the history of conflict,” Wilson said, to claps from the observers. The Electrical Trades Union’s national secretary, Michael Wright, used his right of reply to reject the ad hominem appeasement response, and noted there was “deafening silence” from supporters “about what we’re doing with this waste for the next 100,000 years”. Labor Environment Action Network’s (Lean’s) Felicity Wade said she was “scared that a world that has more nuclear power is a more dangerous world”. The Australian Workers Union’s Paul Farrow joked at Lean’s expense that “we can’t create solar-powered submarines”. Then came the big moment: Albanese, who was not scheduled to speak but had tipped his hand on Thursday that he would participate, was given Marles’s right of reply to make the case for Aukus. Albanese argued there was “no security in isolation” and he regarded an “enhancement” of the US alliance as consistent with Labor values. Nuclear submarines “are harder to detect and can travel further”, the prime minister said. “I have come to the position based upon advice and analysis that nuclear powered submarines are what Australia needs in the future.” Australia is a mature nation that “understands that a bright future calls for more than sunny optimism”. “We have to analyse the world as it is rather than as we would want it to be. We have to bring our defence capabilities up to speed and Aukus is central to that.” Objections and interjections during the Albanese speech were fewer in number, perhaps because members had got it out of their system hating on Conroy. The prime minister then moved on to safer territory, getting a big clap for the promise of 20,000 “well-paid union jobs” from building submarines in Australia. About four-fifths of the delegates gave Albanese a standing ovation, and then it was time to vote on Marles and Conroy’s pro-Aukus statement. It was carried on the voices, meaning there was no counting of cards. The section of delegates opposed to Aukus was clearly outnumbered but generated a good amount of noise for a quarter to one-fifth of the delegates. They included left-aligned unions the ETU, maritime union, Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union, manufacturing workers union, Australian Services Union and some rank and file members. The anti-Aukus motions were declared lapsed by the ALP president, Wayne Swan, and the relevant chapter of the platform closed, turning the page on a well-managed dissent months in the making."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T00:05:10Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is back in the game, but remains a distant prospect for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"Compared to some of his pet projects – the bridge across the Irish Sea or a floating airport in the Thames – Boris Johnson’s plan to get 25% of UK electricity from nuclear power plants by 2050 isn’t all that fanciful. The same mark was reached within living memory, after the commissioning of Sizewell B in 1995. If the climate crisis weren’t reason enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has crystallised the case for any energy technology that allows us to eschew fossil fuels supplied by foreign despots. This week, the prime minister is expected to outline his plan to make the UK more energy self-sufficient, with nuclear likely to be a key component. Charging at full pelt towards a nuclear future is far from straightforward, though, if history is anything to go by. Even when the UK did produce a quarter of its electricity from nukes, the journey there was long and bumpy. Sizewell B was hooked up to the national grid in 1995, but it was first announced in 1969, with spades only breaking ground in 1986. More recently, the industry has been in steady decline. Since that mid-90s peak, capacity has fallen from nearly 13GW to 6.8GW, about 16-18% of the electricity mix. Hunterston B retired this year, Hinkley Point B bows out this summer and by the time Hartlepool I and Heysham I come off grid in 2024, nuclear capacity will have fallen to a paltry 3.6GW, a mere 5-6% of what you’d need at 6pm on a cold weekday in winter. Hinkley Point C is due to recoup 3.2GW of lost ground but only by 2027, assuming no fresh delays. It is not nearly enough to get close to Johnson’s target. That will require the successful execution of nearly every nuclear project to have been mooted in recent years, including some that have struggled to get going so far. It would probably mean extending the life of Sizewell B and giving the go-ahead for Sizewell C, which stalled when the government got cold feet about Chinese involvement. Wylfa on Anglesey, paused after Japanese firm Hitachi pulled out in 2020 citing lack of government investment, would need to be thrown into the mix. Factor in, too, Rolls-Royce’s “mini-nuke” small reactors, which have state backing but carry the risk of novelty. Some of the GE Hitachi partnership’s own small reactors might need to be included too. All of that gets you to about 15GW, likely to fall below 25% of demand in 2050, once you consider that the drive towards net zero will involve significant electrification, of home heating and vehicles, in order to decarbonise. Some in the nuclear industry are daring to breathe the names of semi-mythical locations such as Oldbury and Moorside, where large-scale nuclear projects were abandoned but could be raised from their slumber. The government, previously cordial but cool towards nuclear, appears to be warming to such ideas, minds focused by sky-high fossil fuel prices. As Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, says: “It has reminded people why a significant reliance on something traded internationally [oil and gas] isn’t a good place to be.” There are fences to jump. Financing problems have put paid to major projects in the past. The Treasury still hasn’t rubber-stamped proposals for a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model, which could spur private investment by transferring some of the risk of multibillion-pound projects to the taxpayer. The UK must also resolve the “taxonomy” issue, already sorted in the EU, which determines whether nuclear is suitable for investment funds using environmental and social criteria. There is also a question mark over the number of skilled engineers available, particularly if the nuclear push is replicated across Europe. But George Borovas, head of the nuclear practice at global law firm Hunton Andrew’s Kurth, believes the UK is among the best-placed countries in the world to go nuclear. “The UK has done the preliminary work, it’s done the site evaluation, it has a sophisticated regulator, good heavy industry and an existing fleet. I’ve always thought the UK was a great place for new nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/28/cop-28-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-oil-gas-companies","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-28T13:01:23Z","webTitle":"So what if fossil fuel lobbyists have to declare themselves at Cop28? That won’t curb their power| Amy Westervelt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/cop-28-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-oil-gas-companies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/28/cop-28-fossil-fuel-lobbyists-oil-gas-companies","fields":{"bodyText":"Earlier this month, the UN announced it will require fossil fuel lobbyists to identify themselves as such when registering for the Cop28 climate summit. The move was applauded by campaigners and politicians alike, but it’s a shockingly small first step towards matching the boldness demanded by UN secretary general, António Guterres, when it comes to rooting out fossil fuel influence. In a speech earlier this month, Guterres called for the phase out of fossil fuels themselves, and said oil majors must “cease and desist influence peddling and legal threats designed to knee-cap progress.” The UN’s move to transparently label lobbyists at Cop28 looks a lot like damage control after recent embarrassing revelations, such as there having been more oil lobbyists than any one nation’s delegation at Cop26 in Glasgow. But to actually rid Cop of fossil fuel influence, the UN has to go far beyond finally unmasking industry lobbyists; it needs to hold up a mirror to its own enabling behaviour over the years, then reverse all of it. Exposing just a single node – in this case, the lobbyists – in the complex ecosystem of climate misinformation is not enough to defuse its impact, and in fact might only add to the fairytale that industry representatives are attending the summit in good faith. First, the UN should acknowledge that fossil fuel executives and lobbyists have been deeply embedded in its climate diplomacy since the 1992 Rio Earth summit, which birthed the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Attending that summit alongside global leaders and youth climate activists were multiple members of the Global Climate Coalition – a group created by PR mastermind E Bruce Harrison and made up of corporate members from any polluting industry that felt threatened by the idea of a binding emissions reduction target. In the lead-up to the summit, and at various events during it, Harrison and his clients pushed the idea that industry was already tackling the problem of “the greenhouse effect” via voluntary measures, so there was simply no need for onerous regulatory mechanisms. That idea was baked into the UNFCCC and has remained there, rarely challenged, for decades. Since then, fossil fuel involvement in the annual Conference of the Parties, or Cop, has only grown, and the world has moved further and further away from an agreement that would actually halt warming at safe levels. The Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, was the founding president of the renewable energy company Masdar and is still that company’s chair, while also being managing director of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). And once again, the PR industry is hard at work branding fossil fuel-connected interests as linchpins to climate progress. Much of the news out of Abu Dhabi these days is centred on Masdar: solar projects, sustainable aviation, big plans for renewables, and a doubling of its commitment to install 100GW of renewable energy by 2030. But far more quietly, Adnoc has announced its goal of doubling oil and gas production to hit 5m barrels a day by 2027; as of 2020, the United Arab Emirates was already responsible for 14% of global oil and gas production, and now it has a plan to double its production. Two highlights of Abu Dhabi’s climate week in May, put on by Masdar and promoted by the PR firm Edelman, were appearances by Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg, the UN’s special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, who heralded Al Jaber as the right man for this moment, a leader for the future. In a subsequent op-ed and social media posts, Bloomberg has doubled down on his support of Al Jaber, castigating those who dare to suggest that perhaps the right number of fossil fuel execs at a Cop is zero as naive and counterproductive. But it is actually the idea that fossil fuel executives are capable of leading a global transition away from their core product that is naive, and remarkably ahistorical. Fossil fuel companies have not only had a seat at the table for Cop’s entire history, they’ve run the table. Are we the better for it? Have they galvanised progress? Given that the big question in the lead-up to Cop28 is whether Al Jaber will allow a global treaty that specifically calls for the end of fossil fuel development and extraction, the answer is a painfully obvious no. To really root out fossil fuel influence, the myriad PR execs in and around the process should also have to label their affiliations, for a start. Fossil fuel companies should have to disclose what they are spending on PR and marketing around Cop as well, and what sort of messaging that money is funding. Are they telling the world they’re already transitioning? Are they telling the world that oil and gas are actually a critical part of the solution to climate crisis? Are they pushing false solutions like carbon capture or blue hydrogen or “sustainable” aviation fuels? Are they trying to undermine the credibility of negotiators whose goals don’t align with expanding fossil fuels? “Cop28 is already so shot through with corporate influence, this thing where fossil fuel lobbyists have to identify themselves seems like just throwing climate campaigners a bone,” Melissa Aronczyk, who wrote the book on why polluting industries engage in PR, told me. “It also weirdly gives them added legitimacy, and it won’t have any impact at all on the actual proceedings or outcome.” Cop28’s organisers have been actively courting increased participation from the fossil fuel industry and positioning that approach as critical to the success of climate negotiations. Yet while some have made a “free speech” argument about the importance of fossil fuel companies having a voice at Cop, there’s nothing in any country’s constitution that guarantees citizens access to global conferences. And sociology research has documented time and again the ability of corporate budgets to shout down citizens and the politicians who represent them; they have no shortage of ways to make their opinions known. To give the world’s leaders a chance at a global treaty that actually meets the moment, the UN cannot continue to allow Cop to be dominated by those who fight against the very change the summit is supposed to catalyse.

Instead, hours before his first big policy statement on Tuesday, Yousaf found himself besieged by reporters asking questions about the arrest of the SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie, earlier that morning, and having to insist that while Beattie’s arrest was a “very serious matter”, people were “innocent until proven guilty”. The clamour was further evidence of a Scottish National party in chaos. Just two weeks earlier, its former chief executive Peter Murrell – the husband of Yousaf’s predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon – had also been arrested, with police dramatically raiding the couple’s home and erecting a tent to gather evidence in the garden. The arrests are part of a police inquiry into the SNP’s handling of more than £600,000 in donations raised to campaign for a second independence referendum, but allegedly used for day-to-day running costs instead. It is no repeat of the Westminster MPs’ expenses scandal, but the criminal allegations still raise the prospect of financial wrongdoing. Now MSPs, activists and officials are asking soul-searching questions, many of which boil down to: how could a national party, leading Scotland’s battle for independence from the UK, have been allowed to descend into such turmoil? “Some people are still in shock, some are in denial, some are saying ‘what the fuck?’” says one senior politician representing the north of Scotland. Speaking to a wide range of elected representatives, activists and officials, almost all refer to the explosion in membership that took place immediately after Scotland’s first independence referendum of 2014 as the pivot point for a party where governance – as one ex-minister put it – “became nonexistent”. “The party depended on the old mechanisms for too long and that’s why we are in deep shit,” says a former national executive committee member bluntly. Despite being in government at Holyrood since 2007, it was the influx of energised Yes voters that turned the party – which was still led by people who could remember being spat at in the street while leafletting – into a popular, mass-membership organisation that other Scottish parties feared and admired. As one senior official who worked closely with Sturgeon accepted: “We should have modernised, and we never really changed the governance to accommodate the membership post 2014. Yes there was a lack of transparency and accountability, but it’s unfair to pin everything on one person. Everyone needs to take a long hard look at themselves.” A number of sources describe a kind of institutional stasis, as the party bounced from election campaign to massive conference venue: glossy, controlled and hugely successful in public, but behind the scenes never having time to do more than triage or, increasingly, ignore longer-term issues. Repeatedly, SNP insiders point out that much of the work was done by volunteers with other responsibilities. “Restructuring takes a lot of energy, as does arranging two conferences a year and running eight election campaigns, with a small HQ team. People still don’t appreciate how difficult it was running a party during Covid. People were exhausted.” Many describe an almost passive acceptance of the highly unusual situation of having a married couple at the very top of the party. Murrell had established his reputation in transforming the party’s electoral prospects while his wife was still deputy leader, and “it didn’t seem to be a problem” when she then took over from Alex Salmond as leader and first minister. “Scottish politics is a small world,” says one veteran activist who has worked with both. But what it amounted to was a blurring of the lines between party and government. As one former MP with experience of both Salmond and Sturgeon’s leadership explains: “When we went into government in 2007, nobody had ever run anything. The lines between party and government got blurred and increasingly party machinery was co-opted into running the FM [first minister]. “After 2014 we lacked the experience and ability to run a large national party,” they add. “The leadership team were very inexperienced in handling internal democracy on that scale and increasingly steamrollered over reasonable challenge. Nobody seemed to realise there would be a mighty explosion at some point.” While the willingness to speak about it in public is certainly new, frustrations among the rank and file membership about the behaviour of the SNP leadership go back years, as do attempts to change it. That’s one of the reasons why such a substantial portion of members voted for Kate Forbes, who was narrowly beaten by Yousaf in the leadership contest, suggests another senior party figure. “They were pissed off with HQ, with emails not answered, complaints not dealt with, and above all the complacency.” Another senior official suggests that MSPs and MPs who largely endorsed Yousaf for leadership ignore this at their peril: “The split between the parliamentarians and the membership could end up being a more fundamental issue to the party’s future than the finances.” The clamour for party reform that started during the leadership contest is now deafening, but recent revelations have also galvanised some members. One central belt MSP explains: “Party members have been upset, baffled, shocked, hurt, but there’s also a new confidence in asking questions and demanding transparency from the party. They’re thinking about how to move forward, how to re-engage the people we need to, and at branch level, members are saying ‘let’s get out there, get the new leaflets ready’. There’s nothing they can do about the ongoing revelations, but they can affect what’s happening in their own constituency.” As one former minister who served with Sturgeon puts it: “The trump card was always: ‘Do you really want to do that to the boss?’ It was based on respect and trust, and a discipline based on loyalty.” So what does it mean for Yousaf, leading a party in which the internal critics are unleashed? Forbes and her campaign team have already formed a backbench group focusing on the economy, and other MSPs point to the “energy and experience” on the backbenches. “It depends if Humza is true to his word about being open to new ideas and input from beyond the inner circle,” says one. Many members note a change in tone from Yousaf. Over the Easter recess, and even with the physical demands of Ramadan fasting (Yousaf is a practising Muslim), they admire his visibility, inviting the media to Bute House for a “fireside” briefing, campaigning at weekends with activists, and emailing party members to reassure them soon after Murrell’s arrest.

This was the very intriguing Nine Days in One Year, now restored for its 60th anniversary. It’s a poignant love triangle, a story of broken hearts represented, in a rather David Nicholls-ish device, by the events of nine separate days over one year in the romantic lives of those whose duty was to the Soviet motherland – and to the great cause of the USSR gaining nuclear power. Dmitri Gusev, played by Aleksey Batalov, is a dedicated scientist working on thermonuclear physics in Siberia, whose work has for years taken him away from his humble family in the country. His more playful and worldly scientist friend Ilya (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) is back in Moscow. They are both in love with the same woman: the passionate, focused, beautiful scientist Lyolya (Tatyana Lavrova). At the beginning of the story, Lyolya and Ilya are engaged to be married, but a visit to her former lover Dimitri reveals to Lyolya his heroic dedication and the fact that he has endangered his life with potentially fatal irradiation. Aware of a certain kind of patriotic and personal vocation, Lyolya nobly resolves to marry Dimitri instead, but Ilya, masking his feelings with a certain kind of cynical gaiety, remains in their lives, perhaps sensing Lyolya’s frustration and unhappiness in her marriage. There is a dark, shadowy expressionism in the film, an occult sense of mystery and danger in the underground corridors of the lab. Irradiation is maybe a metaphor for lovesickness, but perhaps the symbol only works if we understand love to mean love of science, or love of country. This is a story of people who unquestioningly sacrifice personal considerations for the Soviet nuclear cause, and yet this lost love looms alongside the Soviet Union’s nuclear destiny with equal potency. • Nine Days in One Year is screening on 15 February at the Institut Français in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/11/nuclear-bomb-fallout-site-chosen-to-define-start-of-anthropocene","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-11T17:00:40Z","webTitle":"Canadian lake chosen to represent start of Anthropocene","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/11/nuclear-bomb-fallout-site-chosen-to-define-start-of-anthropocene","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/11/nuclear-bomb-fallout-site-chosen-to-define-start-of-anthropocene","fields":{"bodyText":"The site to represent the start of the Anthropocene epoch on Earth has been selected by scientists. It will mark the end of 11,700 years of a stable global environment in which the whole of human civilisation developed and the start of a new age, dominated by human activities. The site is a sinkhole lake in Canada. It hosts annual sediments showing clear spikes due to the colossal impact of humanity on the planet from 1950 onwards, from plutonium from hydrogen bomb tests to the particles from fossil fuel burning that have showered the globe. If the site is approved by the scientists who oversee the geological timescale, the official declaration of the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch will come in August 2024. Experts said the decision has social and political importance, as well as great scientific value, as it would testify to the “scale and severity of the planetary transformation processes unleashed by industrialised humanity”. The climate crisis is the most prominent impact of the Anthropocene, but huge losses of wildlife, the spread of invasive species, and the widespread pollution of the planet with plastics and nitrates are also key features. The Anthropocene Working Group was set up in 2009 and in 2016 concluded that the human-caused changes to Earth were so great that a new geological time unit was justified. The AWG then assessed in detail a dozen sites across the world as candidates for what geologists call a “golden spike”, ie the place where the abrupt and global changes marking the start of the new age is best recorded in geological strata. Candidate sites included tropical corals in the US and Australia, a mountainous peat bog in Poland, the Antarctic ice sheet and even the human debris accumulated under the city of Vienna. However, after several rounds of voting by the AWG, Crawford Lake, near Toronto, was selected. “There is compelling evidence globally of a massive shift, a tipping point, in the Earth’s system,” said Prof Francine McCarthy, a geologist at Brock University, Canada, and AWG member. “Crawford Lake is so special because it allows us to see at annual resolution the changes in Earth history.” The lake, formed in a limestone sinkhole, is 24 metres deep but only 2.4 hectares in area. That tall shape means the bottom waters and surface waters do not mix, which would confuse the record laid down in the sediments. “The bottom of the lake is completely isolated from the rest of the planet, except for what gently sinks to the bottom and accumulates in sediment,” McCarthy said. The AWG has chosen the plutonium isotopes from H-bomb tests as the key marker for the Anthropocene, as they were spread globally from 1952 but declined rapidly after the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the mid-1960s, creating a spike in sediments. “The presence of plutonium gives us a stark indicator of when humanity became such a dominant force that it could leave a unique global ‘fingerprint’ on our planet,” said Prof Andrew Cundy, an environmental radiochemist at the University of Southampton, and AWG member. There are other important markers in the lake sediments, including spherical carbon particles produced by the burning of fossil fuels in power plants and nitrates from the mass application of chemical fertilisers. “We have a dramatic increase in the concentration in our core at exactly the same depth that we see the rapid rise in plutonium,” said McCarthy. The 1950s saw the start of the “great acceleration”, the unprecedented increase in industrial, transport and economic activity that occurred after the second world war and continues today. “It is the great acceleration that we decided to use as a major tipping point in Earth history. But it is the increase in plutonium 239 fallout specifically that we chose as the marker,” said McCarthy. Prof Jürgen Renn, director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, in Berlin, Germany, said: “The Anthropocene concept has now received a firm anchoring in a very precise stratigraphic definition, [giving] a reference point for scientific discussions. “It also creates a bridge between the natural sciences and the humanities, because it’s about the humans,” Renn said. “We are looking at something that is shaping our fate as humanity, so it’s very important to have a common reference point.” Official ratification of the Crawford Lake site and the Anthropocene epoch requires passing three more votes of geological authorities, the subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, the International Commission on Stratigraphy and finally the International Union of Geological Sciences. The decision may be a difficult one for geologists, who are used to dealing with time periods spanning millions of years and using rocks with fossils as markers. The AWG will present a dossier of evidence hoping to convince the voting bodies that the Anthropocene does represent a planetary change that requires a new geological time period. Dr Alexander Farnsworth, at the University of Bristol, said plutonium is a radioactive element and decays over time, so might not persist over geological timescales of millions. He also questioned whether an Anthropocene epoch is needed, saying: “We are but a ripple in the river of gene flow through time.” Prof Colin Waters, AWG chair from the University of Leicester, said: “The Anthropocene that starts in the 1950s represents a very rapid change that we have caused to the planet. There’s hope in that respect. The combined impacts of humanity can be changed rapidly for good and for bad. It’s not inevitable that we have to slide into continuing environmental poverty.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T11:00:49Z","webTitle":"‘They are the crucial buyers’: theatres tap into the power of female readers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/apr/09/they-are-the-crucial-buyers-theatres-tap-into-the-power-of-female-readers","fields":{"bodyText":"Female readers are the acknowledged force behind the market in published fiction. Their collective response to a book has decided the fate of many a novelist. And when the book groups of Britain get behind a new title, it makes a big difference to its fortunes. Now canny theatre producers are harnessing that commercial power with a string of new stage shows based on hit books by female authors that were also enjoyed largely by female readers. Waiting in the wings this spring are plays or musicals based on bestsellers that include Hamnet, The Time Traveler’s Wife and The Suspicions of Mr Whicher. While each book is different in tone, they share a ready-made contingent of devoted fans – not all women, of course, but they dominate the fanbase. And even those theatregoers who have not read them yet will at least have heard of some of the titles. “It’s fair to say that women are the drivers of the fiction market – certainly they are the crucial buyers,” said novelist Kate Griffin. Her own gothic drama, Fyneshade, out next month, has been hailed as ripe for stage adaptation in enthusiastic early reviews. “If you look at the covers in a bookshop, you’ll see that so many are gorgeously designed to have an aesthetic and perhaps a specifically female appeal,” said Griffin. “It’s not surprising there’s now a crossover with theatre.” First in front of audiences was the stage version of Hanya Yanagihara’s cult novel A Little Life, which opened in London last week. The original, divisive book made the Booker prize shortlist in 2015 and is still revered by many. In this production, directed by the maverick Belgian Ivo van Hove, the actor James Norton, who plays the central character, Jude, disrobes. “It’s interesting to see [the trend] is happening as female artistic directors and producers are starting to call more shots,” said Griffin. “It’s natural that the choices they make, in terms of commissioning and themes, are filtering through. Having said that, I suspect a key appeal of A Little Life for many women theatregoers might be James Norton getting his kit off!” Hamnet, Maggie O’Farrell’s acclaimed recent novel, is also poised for a glittering transition to the theatre this month. A stage adaptation written by Lolita Chakrabarti for the Royal Shakespeare Company has already secured a West End run at the Garrick theatre this September before it has even made its premiere in Stratford-upon-Avon, where tickets have all but disappeared. The show, which officially opens on Wednesday, stars Madeleine Mantock as Shakespeare’s wife. Like the book, which has sold 1.5m copies worldwide, it centres on her grief at the death of their only son, Hamnet, and speculates on its impact on the playwright’s later work. “Hamnet – a beautiful book in every way – was hugely popular with reading groups, often largely female, and there’s clearly an appetite for these much-loved books to be adapted for stage,” said Griffin. “In my – admittedly subjective – experience, women are also usually the buyers of theatre tickets. So, when something like Hamnet comes to the stage, there’s already a receptive audience.” The co-producers of the stage show, Neal Street, are also behind a new film version of O’Farrell’s book, to be directed by the Oscar winner Chloé Zhao. There is, Griffin suspects, a completist urge among many serious fans of popular novels that will lead them to buy both theatre and cinema tickets, just as they have collected different print editions. Dave Stewart, once of the Eurythmics, will be hoping the same holds true for his new musical, The Time Traveller’s Wife, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger’s 2003 fantasy. Stewart has written the songs for the show, with the singer Joss Stone as his lyricist. The script, by Lauren Gunderson, will tell of the unconventional romance between a time traveller and a sculptor called Clare. Already the subject of a film and a TV series, the book’s stage version opens this autumn at the Apollo theatre in London’s West End. The many fans of the gripping 2008 bestseller The Suspicions of Mr Whicher by Kate Summerscale will only have to wait until May, when the fact-based murder story, set in 1860, comes to the Watermill theatre in Berkshire. Adapted by Alexandra Wood, it will pit Jonathan Whicher, the celebrated Scotland Yard detective, against a perplexing and grim country house mystery. And the literary-theatrical trend, which arguably started with the RSC’s staging of Hilary Mantel’s hit Wolf Hall series in 2014, looks set to continue, with Annie Proulx’s influential 1997 story Brokeback Mountain also being developed for the stage. The new stream of women’s fiction now supplying our stages follows a tide of recent productions based on well-known screen stories. The majority of these shows, such as Back to the Future, Moulin Rouge!, The Great British Bake Off Musical, Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing, have used popular films or TV series as their source material. Forthcoming productions to do the same include a return for Tim Minchin’s version of Groundhog Day and a new play based on the sci-fi drama Stranger Things. A version of the Robin Williams film comedy Mrs Doubtfire is also on the way to the UK in musical form, although this show surely belongs in the women’s fiction category too, since the original 1987 book, Madame Doubtfire, was written by the English novelist Anne Fine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/sep/06/former-oil-executive-mark-mcallister-lined-up-to-be-next-ofgem-chair","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-06T14:06:00Z","webTitle":"Former oil executive Mark McAllister lined up to be next Ofgem chair","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/06/former-oil-executive-mark-mcallister-lined-up-to-be-next-ofgem-chair","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/sep/06/former-oil-executive-mark-mcallister-lined-up-to-be-next-ofgem-chair","fields":{"bodyText":"A former North Sea oil and gas boss has been lined up to chair Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, in a move criticised as “putting the fox in charge of the hen house”. The government said Mark McAllister, who founded two oil and gas companies, Fairfield Energy and Acorn Oil &amp; Gas, had “vital expertise” that would help him in the role. The Lib Dems said it was not a suitable choice given McAllister’s history in the oil and gas industry at a time when companies have been criticised for making huge profits on the back of high energy prices. At the same time, households have been struggling with record gas and electricity bills over the last year, with the government providing about £40bn in support for consumers and businesses. Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem energy spokesperson, said the choice of McAllister as the government’s preferred candidate to chair Ofgem showed Sunak was “woefully out of touch”. Ofgem has a duty to champion the interests of consumers who have faced soaring energy bills and its remit was also recently changed to have regard for net zero policies. Labour has said it would end new oil and gas licences in the North Sea but Sunak has committed to new licences that he says are necessary for energy security. McAllister is chair of the nuclear regulator, is involved in charitable causes, and no longer has interests in the oil and gas industry, according to his declared interests at the Office for Nuclear Regulation. Before this job, he was director of a Chinese government-controlled shipping company involved in the offshore oil industry, and founded Fairfield Energy and Acorn Oil &amp; Gas, as well as chairing an industry safety group for the North Sea after BP’s Deepwater Horizon spill. He previously held roles at British Gas and ConocoPhillips, according to his LinkedIn page. Amanda Solloway, the minister for energy consumers and affordability, said McAllister would bring a “strong track record” in the industry to the role. His appointment will be subject to scrutiny by parliament’s committee on energy security and net zero before it is confirmed. “We will always ensure the energy market is working for families to protect them from sky high bills, including by working closely with our partners at Ofgem,” Solloway said. “Mark McAllister has a strong track record of advising governments and regulators on competition and regulation. His expertise will be vital in the years ahead, as we make sure more households have access to cheaper, cleaner energy.” Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “As soon as the energy bill becomes law, Ofgem will have a mandate to pursue an energy system that delivers the carbon budgets under the Climate Change Act. That means a dramatic shift to renewables in electricity and the exclusion of fossil fuels. “We hope that Mr McAllister can put behind him his past engagement with fossil fuels, and more recently nuclear power, and focus on the technologies needed to make this transition happen, which will also be good for consumers. If he is able to do that, we wish him well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/sep/05/pat-mcfadden-the-most-powerful-labour-politician-most-have-never-heard-of","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-05T18:55:20Z","webTitle":"Pat McFadden: the most powerful Labour politician most have never heard of","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/sep/05/pat-mcfadden-the-most-powerful-labour-politician-most-have-never-heard-of","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/sep/05/pat-mcfadden-the-most-powerful-labour-politician-most-have-never-heard-of","fields":{"bodyText":"Pat McFadden is the most powerful Labour politician most people have never heard of. As Rachel Reeves’ No 2 in the shadow Treasury team, with responsibility for Labour’s public spending plans, he could derail the dreams of shadow cabinet colleagues with just a raised eyebrow. In his new role preparing for the election campaign and – should Labour win it – running the Cabinet Office, he assumes even greater responsibility for the direction of Keir Starmer’s party. Yet much of it is likely to be done quietly, and efficiently, behind the scenes. McFadden, 58, is a veteran of Tony Blair’s era, working on the 1997 election campaign alongside Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, becoming the prime minister’s political secretary in 2002, before entering parliament in 2005 as MP for Wolverhampton South East, a seat with one of the highest levels of deprivation in the country. When Mandelson, by then a peer, was made business secretary in 2008, McFadden was his deputy, running parts of the department and representing it in the House of Commons. “Pat has seen it all,” he says. “He is a walking encyclopedia of political and policy knowledge, and experience in government.” Mandelson describes his former No 2 as “pure New Labour”, adding: “He’s solid, hard-nosed, centre-left. He lives and breathes it. But he’s not a receptacle following others’ ideas – he has his own.” McFadden’s involvement with the Labour party goes back further – and deeper – than Blair, to his working-class roots in Glasgow, where he was the youngest of seven siblings growing up in the 1970s and 1980s under the shadow of Margaret Thatcher. He joined the Labour party at Edinburgh university, citing Neil Kinnock taking on Militant in his 1985 Bournemouth conference speech as an inspiration, and soon after graduating he took a job as a researcher for Labour’s Scottish affairs spokesperson, Donald Dewar. McFadden’s allies describe him as a “pragmatist” who is “never ideological” and say that he is driven by giving the same “choices and chances” to those that don’t have money as those that do, in key areas such as school standards, NHS reform and social mobility. While his friends describe him as “loyal”, with “a lovely manner” and “good with people”, they all agree that he is a “very serious man” who doesn’t suffer fools – or his political enemies – gladly. He is unforgiving when it comes to attacking the Conservatives, and despite that he still garners respect from across the House of Commons, with even Tory MPs silent when he talks. The former business secretary Andrea Leadsom, who sat with McFadden, a Celtic fan and a keen early morning runner, on the Treasury select committee between 2010 and 2014, describes him as a “serious and hard-working colleague”. Yet she also recalls his sense of humour. On a committee visit to China the MPs toured the biggest toy factory in the world. “Pat and I went to find a toy car for his toddler and we discovered you could buy 50 toy cars but not one,” she says. Over the years McFadden has made enemies on the left of the Labour party. He was sacked from Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench in January 2016 for “disloyalty” after a Commons statement on the 2015 Paris attacks, in which he condemned the “view that sees terrorist acts as always being a response or a reaction to what we in the west do”. His dramatic exit triggered a number of frontbench resignations. One Labour MP on the soft-left of the party, who declined to be named, said: “He may be softly spoken, but he’s as hard as they come. He’s been absolutely ruthlessly focused on fiscal discipline, but where’s the hope? Where’s the inspiration?” Allies of McFadden say that he understands the balancing act between reassurance and hope, and doesn’t like it being posed as a choice. “He thinks that any political party has to do both and that it’s a mistake to say it’s all about one or the other,” one says. McFadden, along with elections supremo Morgan McSweeney, will be central to that. “He’s got lots of campaigning experience and will bring grip and discipline and making sure the political message matches everything else Labour does,” says Campbell. Starmer’s decision to bolster his political operation – which even some of his closest allies admits he needs – means that Ellie Reeves, the shadow chancellor’s sister, will be McFadden’s deputy. His wife, Marianna, is already McSweeney’s No 2. Mandelson believes that McFadden and McSweeney will complement each other as they steer Labour towards the next election. “Pat is cautious, then decisive. Morgan is a hard-driven street fighter with loads of courage.” Yet even with his expanded influence, McFadden is not seen as ambitious in his own right. “He’s got the potential to be a really exceptional politician,” says Campbell. “But he’s diffident and dry and doesn’t like thrusting himself into the spotlight.” His allies admit he is “not enormously ambitious” and that he would rather just help Starmer in “any way that he thinks is useful”. But one points out that his decades on the political frontline gives him experience, and with it influence, that few in Labour can replicate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-15T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site","fields":{"bodyText":"If you take the cosmic view of Sellafield, the superannuated nuclear facility in north-west England, its story began long before the Earth took shape. About 9bn years ago, tens of thousands of giant stars ran out of fuel, collapsed upon themselves, and then exploded. The sheer force of these supernova detonations mashed together the matter in the stars’ cores, turning lighter elements like iron into heavier ones like uranium. Flung out by such explosions, trillions of tonnes of uranium traversed the cold universe and wound up near our slowly materialising solar system. And here, over roughly 20m years, the uranium and other bits of space dust and debris cohered to form our planet in such a way that the violent tectonics of the young Earth pushed the uranium not towards its hot core but up into the folds of its crust. Within reach, so to speak, of the humans who eventually came along circa 300,000BC, and who mined the uranium beginning in the 1500s, learned about its radioactivity in 1896 and started feeding it into their nuclear reactors 70-odd years ago, making electricity that could be relayed to their houses to run toasters and light up Christmas trees. Sellafield compels this kind of gaze into the abyss of deep time because it is a place where multiple time spans – some fleeting, some cosmic – drift in and out of view. Laid out over six square kilometres, Sellafield is like a small town, with nearly a thousand buildings, its own roads and even a rail siding – all owned by the government, and requiring security clearance to visit. Sellafield’s presence, at the end of a road on the Cumbrian coast, is almost hallucinatory. One moment you’re passing cows drowsing in pastures, with the sea winking just beyond. Then, having driven through a high-security gate, you’re surrounded by towering chimneys, pipework, chugging cooling plants, everything dressed in steampunk. The sun bounces off metal everywhere. In some spots, the air shakes with the noise of machinery. It feels like the most manmade place in the world. Since it began operating in 1950, Sellafield has had different duties. First it manufactured plutonium for nuclear weapons. Then it generated electricity for the National Grid, until 2003. It also carried out years of fuel reprocessing: extracting uranium and plutonium from nuclear fuel rods after they’d ended their life cycles. The very day before I visited Sellafield, in mid-July, the reprocessing came to an end as well. It was a historic occasion. From an operational nuclear facility, Sellafield turned into a full-time storage depot – but an uncanny, precarious one, filled with toxic nuclear waste that has to be kept contained at any cost. Nothing is produced at Sellafield any more. Which was just as well, because I’d gone to Sellafield not to observe how it lived but to understand how it is preparing for its end. Sellafield’s waste – spent fuel rods, scraps of metal, radioactive liquids, a miscellany of other debris – is parked in concrete silos, artificial ponds and sealed buildings. Some of these structures are growing, in the industry’s parlance, “intolerable”, atrophied by the sea air, radiation and time itself. If they degrade too much, waste will seep out of them, poisoning the Cumbrian soil and water. To prevent that disaster, the waste must be hauled out, the silos destroyed and the ponds filled in with soil and paved over. The salvaged waste will then be transferred to more secure buildings that will be erected on site. But even that will be only a provisional arrangement, lasting a few decades. Nuclear waste has no respect for human timespans. The best way to neutralise its threat is to move it into a subterranean vault, of the kind the UK plans to build later this century. Once interred, the waste will be left alone for tens of thousands of years, while its radioactivity cools. Dealing with all the radioactive waste left on site is a slow-motion race against time, which will last so long that even the grandchildren of those working on site will not see its end. The process will cost at least £121bn. Compared to the longevity of nuclear waste, Sellafield has only been around for roughly the span of a single lunch break within a human life. Still, it has lasted almost the entirety of the atomic age, witnessing both its earliest follies and its continuing confusions. In 1954, Lewis Strauss, the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, predicted that nuclear energy would make electricity “too cheap to meter”. That forecast has aged poorly. The main reason power companies and governments aren’t keener on nuclear power is not that activists are holding them back or that uranium is difficult to find, but that producing it safely is just proving too expensive. Strauss was, like many others, held captive by one measure of time and unable to truly fathom another. The short-termism of policymaking neglected any plans that had to be made for the abominably lengthy, costly life of radioactive waste. I kept being told, at Sellafield, that science is still trying to rectify the decisions made in undue haste three-quarters of a century ago. Many of the earliest structures here, said Dan Bowman, the head of operations at one of Sellafield’s two waste storage ponds, “weren’t even built with decommissioning in mind”. As a result, Bowman admitted, Sellafield’s scientists are having to invent, mid-marathon, the process of winding the site down – and they’re finding that they still don’t know enough about it. They don’t know exactly what they’ll find in the silos and ponds. They don’t know how much time they’ll need to mop up all the waste, or how long they’ll have to store it, or what Sellafield will look like afterwards. The decommissioning programme is laden “with assumptions and best guesses”, Bowman told me. It will be finished a century or so from now. Until then, Bowman and others will bend their ingenuity to a seemingly self-contradictory exercise: dismantling Sellafield while keeping it from falling apart along the way. * * * To take apart an ageing nuclear facility, you have to put a lot of other things together first. New technologies, for instance, and new buildings to replace the intolerable ones, and new reserves of money. (That £121bn price tag may swell further.) All of Sellafield is in a holding pattern, trying to keep waste safe until it can be consigned to the ultimate strongroom: the geological disposal facility (GDF), bored hundreds of metres into the Earth’s rock, a project that could cost another £53bn. Even if a GDF receives its first deposit in the 2040s, the waste has to be delivered and put away with such exacting caution that it can be filled and closed only by the middle of the 22nd century. Anywhere else, this state of temporariness might induce a mood of lax detachment, like a transit lounge to a frequent flyer. But at Sellafield, with all its caches of radioactivity, the thought of catastrophe is so ever-present that you feel your surroundings with a heightened keenness. At one point, when we were walking through the site, a member of the Sellafield team pointed out three different waste storage facilities within a 500-metre radius. The spot where we stood on the road, he said, “is probably the most hazardous place in Europe”. Sellafield’s waste comes in different forms and potencies. Spent fuel rods and radioactive pieces of metal rest in skips, which in turn are submerged in open, rectangular ponds, where water cools them and absorbs their radiation. The skips have held radioactive material for so long that they themselves count as waste. The pond beds are layered with nuclear sludge: degraded metal wisps, radioactive dust and debris. Discarded cladding, peeled off fuel rods like banana-skins, fills a cluster of 16-metre-deep concrete silos partially sunk into the earth. More dangerous still are the 20 tonnes of melted fuel inside a reactor that caught fire in 1957 and has been sealed off and left alone ever since. Somewhere on the premises, Sellafield has also stored the 140 tonnes of plutonium it has purified over the decades. It’s the largest such hoard of plutonium in the world, but it, too, is a kind of waste, simply because nobody wants it for weapons any more, or knows what else to do with it. It has been a dithery decade for nuclear policy. After the 2011 disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, several countries began shuttering their reactors and tearing up plans for new ones. They’d become inordinately expensive to build and maintain, in any case, especially compared to solar and wind installations. In the UK, the fraction of electricity generated by nuclear plants has slid steadily downwards, from 25% in the 1990s to 16% in 2020. Of the five nuclear stations still producing power, only one will run beyond 2028. Hinkley Point C, the first new nuclear plant in a generation, is being built in Somerset, but its cost has bloated to more than £25bn. This year, though, governments felt the pressure to redo their sums when sanctions on Russia abruptly choked off supplies of oil and gas. Wealthy nations suddenly found themselves worrying about winter blackouts. In this crisis, governments are returning to the habit they were trying to break. Germany had planned to abandon nuclear fuel by the end of this year, but in October, it extended that deadline to next spring. The US allocated $6bn to save struggling plants; the UK pressed ahead with plans for Sizewell C, a nuclear power station to be built in Suffolk. Japan, its Fukushima trauma just a decade old, announced that it will commission new plants. Even as Sellafield is cleaning up after the first round of nuclear enthusiasm, another is getting under way. * * * Any time spent in Sellafield is scored to a soundtrack of alarms and signals. The radiation trackers clipped to our protective overalls let off soft cheeps, their frequency varying as radioactivity levels changed around us. Before leaving every building, we ran Geiger counters over ourselves – always remembering to scan the tops of our heads and the soles of our feet – and these clacked like rattlesnakes. At one spot, our trackers went mad. A pipe on the outside of a building had cracked, and staff had planted 10ft-tall sheets of lead into the ground around it to shield people from the radiation. It was perfectly safe, my guide assured me. We power-walked past nonetheless. The day I visited Sellafield was the UK’s hottest ever. We sweltered even before we put on heavy boots and overalls to visit the reprocessing plant, where, until the previous day, technicians had culled uranium and plutonium out of spent fuel. Every second, on each of the plant’s four floors, I heard a beep – a regular pulse, reminding everyone that nothing is amiss. “We’ve got folks here who joined at 18 and have been here more than 40 years, working only in this building,” said Lisa Dixon, an operations manager. Dixon’s father had been a welder here, and her husband is one of the firefighters stationed permanently on site. She meets aunts and cousins on her shifts all the time. When she says Sellafield is one big family, she isn’t just being metaphorical. I only ever saw a dummy of a spent fuel rod; the real thing would have been a metre long, weighed 10-12kg, and, when it emerged from a reactor, run to temperatures of 2,800C, half as hot as the surface of the sun. In a reactor, hundreds of rods of fresh uranium fuel slide into a pile of graphite blocks. Then a stream of neutrons, usually emitted by an even more radioactive metal such as californium, is directed into the pile. Those neutrons generate more neutrons out of uranium atoms, which generate still more neutrons out of other uranium atoms, and so on, the whole process begetting vast quantities of heat that can turn water into steam and drive turbines. During this process, some of the uranium atoms, randomly but very usefully, absorb darting neutrons, yielding heavier atoms of plutonium: the stuff of nuclear weapons. The UK’s earliest reactors – a type called Magnox – were set up to harvest plutonium for bombs; the electricity was a happy byproduct. The government built 26 such reactors across the country. They’re all being decommissioned now, or awaiting demolition. It turned out that if you weren’t looking to make plutonium nukes to blow up cities, Magnox was a pretty inefficient way to light up homes and power factories. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, one of Sellafield’s chief tasks was reprocessing. Once uranium and plutonium were extracted from used fuel rods, it was thought, they could be stored safely – and perhaps eventually resold, to make money on the side. Beginning in 1956, spent rods came to Cumbria from plants across the UK, but also by sea from customers in Italy and Japan. Sellafield has taken in nearly 60,000 tonnes of spent fuel, more than half of all such fuel reprocessed anywhere in the world. The rods arrived at Sellafield by train, stored in cuboid “flasks” with corrugated sides, each weighing about 50 tonnes and standing 1.5 metres tall. The flasks were cast from single ingots of stainless steel, their walls a third of a metre thick. Responding to worries about how robust these containers were, the government, in 1984, arranged to have a speeding train collide head-on with a flask. The video is spectacular. At 100mph, a part of the locomotive exploded and the train derailed. But the flask, a few scratches and dents aside, stayed intact. At Sellafield, the rods were first cooled in ponds of water for between 90 and 250 days. Then they were skinned of their cladding and dissolved in boiling nitric acid. From that liquor, technicians separated out uranium and plutonium, powdery like cumin. This cycle, from acid to powder, lasted up to 36 hours, Dixon said – and it hadn’t improved a jot in efficiency in the years she’d been there. The only change was the dwindling number of rods coming in, as Magnox reactors closed everywhere. The day before I met Dixon, technicians had fed one final batch of spent fuel into acid – and that was that, the end of reprocessing. It marked Sellafield’s transition from an operational facility to a depot devoted purely to storage and containment. The rods went in late in the evening, after hours of technical hitches, so the moment itself was anticlimactic. “They just dropped through, and you heard nothing. So it was like: ‘OK, that’s it? Let’s go home,’” Dixon said. But the following morning, when I met her, she felt sombre, she admitted. “Everybody’s thinking: ‘What do we do? There’s no fuel coming in.’ I don’t think it’s really hit the team just yet.” The reprocessing plant’s end was always coming. The pipes and steam lines, many from the 1960s, kept fracturing. Dixon’s team was running out of spare parts that aren’t manufactured any more. “Since December 2019,” Dixon said, “I’ve only had 16 straight days of running the plant at any one time.” Best to close it down – to conduct repairs, clean the machines and take them apart. Then, at last, the reprocessing plant will be placed on “fire watch”, visited periodically to ensure nothing in the building is going up in flames, but otherwise left alone for decades for its radioactivity to dwindle, particle by particle. * * * Like malign glitter, radioactivity gets everywhere, turning much of what it touches into nuclear waste. The humblest items – a paper towel or a shoe cover used for just a second in a nuclear environment – can absorb radioactivity, but this stuff is graded as low-level waste; it can be encased in a block of cement and left outdoors. (Cement is an excellent shield against radiation. A popular phrase in the nuclear waste industry goes: “When in doubt, grout.”) Even the paper towel needs a couple of hundred years to shed its radioactivity and become safe, though. A moment of use, centuries of quarantine: radiation tends to twist time all out of proportion. On the other hand, high-level waste – the byproduct of reprocessing – is so radioactive that its containers will give off heat for thousands of years. It, too, will become harmless over time, but the scale of that time is planetary, not human. The number of radioactive atoms in the kind of iodine found in nuclear waste byproducts halves every 16m years. In comparison, consider how different the world looked a mere 7,000 years ago, when a determined pedestrian could set out from the Humber estuary, in northern England, and walk across to the Netherlands and then to Norway. Planning for the disposal of high-level waste has to take into account the drift of continents and the next ice age. All radioactivity is a search for stability. Most of the atoms in our daily lives – the carbon in the wood of a desk, the oxygen in the air, the silicon in window glass – have stable nuclei. But in the atoms of some elements like uranium or plutonium, protons and neutrons are crammed into their nuclei in ways that make them unsteady – make them radioactive. These atoms decay, throwing off particles and energy over years or millennia until they become lighter and more stable. Nuclear fuel is radioactive, of course, but so is nuclear waste, and the only thing that can render such waste harmless is time. Waste can travel incognito, to fatal effect: radioactive atoms carried by the wind or water, entering living bodies, riddling them with cancer, ruining them inside out. During the 1957 reactor fire at Sellafield, a radioactive plume of particles poured from the top of a 400-foot chimney. A few days later, some of these particles were detected as far away as Germany and Norway. Near Sellafield, radioactive iodine found its way into the grass of the meadows where dairy cows grazed, so that samples of milk taken in the weeks after the fire showed 10 times the permissible level. The government had to buy up milk from farmers living in 500 sq km around Sellafield and dump it in the Irish Sea. From the outset, authorities hedged and fibbed. For three days, no one living in the area was told about the gravity of the accident, or even advised to stay indoors and shut their windows. Workers at Sellafield, reporting their alarming radiation exposure to their managers, were persuaded that they’d “walk [it] off on the way home”, the Daily Mirror reported at the time. A government inquiry was then held, but its report was not released in full until 1988. For nearly 30 years, few people knew that the fire dispersed not just radioactive iodine but also polonium, far more deadly. The estimated toll of cancer cases has been revised upwards continuously, from 33 to 200 to 240. Sellafield took its present name only in 1981, in part to erase the old name, Windscale, and the associated memories of the fire. The invisibility of radiation and the opacity of governments make for a bad combination. Sellafield hasn’t suffered an accident of equivalent scale since the 1957 fire, but the niggling fear that some radioactivity is leaking out of the facility in some fashion has never entirely vanished. In 1983, a Sellafield pipeline discharged half a tonne of radioactive solvent into the sea. British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the government firm then running Sellafield, was fined £10,000. Around the same time, a documentary crew found higher incidences than expected of leukaemia among children in some surrounding areas. A government study concluded that radiation from Sellafield wasn’t to blame. Perhaps, the study suggested, the leukaemia had an undetected, infectious cause. It was no secret that Sellafield kept on site huge stashes of spent fuel rods, waiting to be reprocessed. This was lucrative work. An older reprocessing plant on site earned £9bn over its lifetime, half of it from customers overseas. But the pursuit of commercial reprocessing turned Sellafield and a similar French site into “de facto waste dumps”, the journalist Stephanie Cooke found in her book In Mortal Hands. Sellafield now requires £2bn a year to maintain. What looked like a smart line of business back in the 1950s has now turned out to be anything but. With every passing year, maintaining the world’s costliest rubbish dump becomes more and more commercially calamitous. The expenditure rises because structures age, growing more rickety, more prone to mishap. In 2005, in an older reprocessing plant at Sellafield, 83,000 litres of radioactive acid – enough to fill a few hundred bathtubs – dripped out of a ruptured pipe. The plant had to be shut down for two years; the cleanup cost at least £300m. The year before the pandemic, a sump tank attached to a waste pond sprang a leak and had to be grouted shut. Around the same time, an old crack in a waste silo opened up again. It posed no health risk, Sellafield determined, so it was still dripping liquid into the ground when I visited. The silos are rudimentary concrete bins, built for waste to be tipped in, but for no other kind of access. Their further degradation is a sure thing. It all put me in mind of a man who’d made a house of ice in deepest winter but now senses spring around the corner, and must move his furniture out before it all melts and collapses around him. * * * Some industrial machines have soothing names; the laser snake is not one of them. After its fat, six-metre-long body slinks out of its cage-like housing, it can rear up in serpentine fashion, as if scanning its surroundings for prey. Its anatomy is made up of accordion folds, so it can stretch and compress on command. The snake’s face is the size and shape of a small dinner plate, with a mouth through which it fires a fierce, purple shaft of light. The laser can slice through inches-thick steel, sparks flaring from the spot where the beam blisters the metal. It took two years and £5m to develop this instrument. If Philip K Dick designed your nightmares, the laser snake would haunt them. Six years ago, the snake’s creators put it to work in a demo at Sellafield. A 10-storey building called B204 had been Sellafield’s first reprocessing facility, but in 1973, a rogue chemical reaction filled the premises with radioactive gas. Thirty-four workers were contaminated, and the building was promptly closed down. Gas, fuel rods and radioactive equipment were all left in place, in sealed rooms known as cells, which turned so lethal that humans haven’t entered them since. The snake, though, could slither right in – through a hole drilled into a cell wall, and right up to a two-metre-high, double-walled steel vat once used to dissolve fuel in acid. Like so much else in B204, the vat was radioactive waste. It had to be disposed of, but it was too big to remove in one piece. For six weeks, Sellafield’s engineers prepared for the task, rehearsing on a 3D model, ventilating the cell, setting up a stream of air to blow away the molten metal, ensuring that nothing caught fire from the laser’s sparks. Once in action, the snake took mere minutes to cut up the vat. But then the pieces were left in the cell. No one had figured out yet how to remove them. The snake hasn’t been deployed since 2015, because other, more urgent tasks lie at hand. As a project, tackling Sellafield’s nuclear waste is a curious mix of sophistication and what one employee called the “poky stick” approach. On the one hand, it calls for ingenious machines like the laser snake, conceived especially for Sellafield. But the years-long process of scooping waste out can also feel crude and time-consuming – “like emptying a wheelie bin with a teaspoon”, Phil Atherton, a manager working with the silo team, told me. New forms of storage have to be devised for the waste, once it’s removed. These have to be secure and robust – but they can’t be irretrievably secure and robust, because scientists may yet develop better ways to deal with waste. “You don’t want to do anything that forecloses any prospective solutions,” Atherton said. No possible version of the future can be discounted. We walked on the roof of the silos, atop their heavy concrete caps. Below us, submerged in water, lay decades’ worth of intermediate-level waste – not quite as radioactive as spent fuel rods, but more harmful than low-level paper towels. Most of it was swarf – the cladding skinned off fuel rods, broken into chunks three or four inches long. What Atherton really wanted to show off, though, was a new waste retrieval system: a machine as big as a studio apartment, designed from scratch over two decades and built at a cost of £100m. Its 13,500 working parts together weigh 350 tonnes. It perched on rails running the length of the building, so that it could be moved and positioned above an uncapped silo. An operator sits inside the machine, reaching long, mechanical arms into the silo to fish out waste. In the water’s gloom, cameras offer little help, he said: “You’re mostly playing by feel.” In the two preceding months, the team had pulled out enough waste to fill four skips. Eventually there will be two more retrieval machines in the silos, their arms poking and clasping like the megafauna cousins of those fairground soft-toy grabbers. Even so, it will take until 2050 to empty all the silos. The skips of extricated waste will be compacted to a third of their volume, grouted and moved into another Sellafield warehouse; at some point, they will be sequestered in the ground, in the GDF that is, at present, hypothetical. Not far from the silos, I met John Cassidy, who has helped manage one of Sellafield’s waste storage ponds for more than three decades – so long that a colleague called him “the Oracle”. Cassidy’s pond, which holds 14,000 cubic metres of water, resembles an extra-giant, extra-filthy lido planted in the middle of an industrial park. In the water, the skips full of used fuel rods were sometimes stacked three deep, and when one was placed in or pulled out, rods tended to tumble out on to the floor of the pond. We climbed a staircase in a building constructed over a small part of the pond. On one floor, we stopped to look at a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV – a steamer trunk-sized thing with a yellow carapace, floating in the algal-green water. “You see the little arm at the end of it?” Cassidy said. “So it’ll float down to the bottom of the pond, pick up a nuclear rod that has fallen out of a skip, and put it back into the skip.” Sometimes, though, a human touch is required. This winter, Sellafield will hire professional divers from the US. Nuclear plants keep so much water on hand – to cool fuel, moderate the reactor’s heat, or generate steam – that a class of specialist divers works only in the ponds and tanks at these plants, inspecting and repairing them. In Sellafield, these nuclear divers will put on radiation-proof wetsuits and tidy up the pond floor, reaching the places where robotic arms cannot go. Two floors above, a young Sellafield employee sat in a gaming chair, working at a laptop with a joystick. He was manoeuvring an ROV fitted with a toilet brush – “a regular brush, bought at the store,” he said, “just kind of reinforced with a bit of plastic tube”. With a delicacy not ordinarily required of it, the toilet brush wiped debris and algae off a skip until the digits “9738”, painted in black, appeared on the skip’s flank. When they arrived over the years, during the heyday of reprocessing, the skips were unloaded into pools so haphazardly that Sellafield is now having to build an underwater map of what is where, just to know best how to get it all out. Skip No 9738 went into the map, one more hard-won addition to Sellafield’s knowledge of itself. * * * “Waste disposal is a completely solved problem,” Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, declared in 1979. He was right, but only in theory. The nuclear industry certainly knew about the utility of water, steel and concrete as shields against radioactivity, and by the 1970s, the US government had begun considering burying reactor waste in a GDF. But Teller was glossing over the details, namely: the expense of keeping waste safe, the duration over which it has to be maintained, the accidents that could befall it, the fallout of those accidents. Four decades on, not a single GDF has begun to operate anywhere in the world. Teller’s complete solution is still a hypothesis. Instead, there have been only interim solutions, although to a layperson, even these seem to have been conceived in some scientist’s intricate delirium. High-level waste, like the syrupy liquor formed during reprocessing, has to be cooled first, in giant tanks. Then it is vitrified: mixed with three parts glass beads and a little sugar, until it turns into a hot block of dirty-brown glass. (The sugar reduces the waste’s volatility. “We like to get ours from Tate &amp; Lyle,” Eva Watson-Graham, a Sellafield information officer, said.) Since 1991, stainless steel containers full of vitrified waste, each as tall as a human, have been stacked 10-high in a warehouse. If you stand on the floor above them, Watson-Graham said, you can still sense a murmuring warmth on the soles of your shoes. Even this elaborate vitrification is insufficient in the long, long, long run. Fire or flood could destroy Sellafield’s infrastructure. Terrorists could try to get at the nuclear material. Governments change, companies fold, money runs out. Nations dissolve. Glass degrades. The ground sinks and rises, so that land becomes sea and sea becomes land. The contingency planning that scientists do today – the kind that wasn’t done when the industry was in its infancy – contends with yawning stretches of time. Hence the GDF: a terrestrial cavity to hold waste until its dangers have dried up and it becomes as benign as the surrounding rock. A glimpse of such an endeavour is available already, beneath Finland. From Helsinki, if you drive 250km west, then head another half-km down, you will come to a warren of tunnels called Onkalo. Other underground vaults have been built to store intermediate waste, but for briefer periods; one that opened in a salt cavern in New Mexico in 1999 will last merely 10,000 years. If Onkalo begins operating on schedule, in 2025, it will be the world’s first GDF for spent fuel and high-level reactor waste – 6,500 tonnes of the stuff, all from Finnish nuclear stations. It will cost €5.5bn and is designed to be safe for a million years. The species that is building it, Homo sapiens, has only been around for a third of that time. Constructed by a firm named Posiva, Onkalo has been hewn into the island of Olkiluoto, a brief bridge’s length off Finland’s south-west coast. When I visited in October, the birches on Olkiluoto had turned to a hot blush. The air was pure Baltic brine. In a van, we went down a steep, dark ramp for a quarter of an hour until we reached Onkalo’s lowest level, and here I caught the acrid odour of a closed space in which heavy machinery has run for a long time. Up close, the walls were pimpled and jagged, like stucco, but at a distance, the rock’s surface undulated like soft butter. Twice, we followed a feebly lit tunnel only to turn around and drive back up. “I still get lost sometimes here,” said Sanna Mustonen, a geologist with Posiva, “even after all these years.” After Onkalo takes in all its waste, these caverns will be sealed up to the surface with bentonite, a kind of clay that absorbs water, and that is often found in cat litter. It took four decades just to decide the location of Finland’s GDF. So much had to be considered, Mustonen said. How easy would it be to drill and blast through the 1.9bn-year-old bedrock below the site? How dry is it below ground? How stable will the waste be amidst the fracture zones in these rocks? What are the odds of tsunamis and earthquakes? How high will the sea rise? How will the rock bear up if, in the next ice age, tens of thousands of years from today, a kilometre or two of ice forms on the surface? Accidents had to be modelled. Fifteen years after the New Mexico site opened, a drum of waste burst open, leaking radiation up an exhaust shaft and then for a kilometre or so above ground. (The cause was human error: someone had added a wheat-based cat litter into the drum instead of bentonite.) In late 2021, Posiva submitted all its studies and contingency plans to the Finnish government to seek an operating license. The document ran to 17,000 pages. In the 2120s, once it has been filled, Onkalo will be sealed and turned over to the state. Other countries also plan to banish their nuclear waste into GDFs. Sweden has already selected its spot, Switzerland and France are trying to finalise theirs. The UK’s plans are at an earlier stage. A government agency, Nuclear Waste Services, is studying locations and talking to the people living there, but already the ballpark expenditure is staggering. “If the geology is simple, and we’re disposing of just high- and intermediate-level waste, then we’re thinking £20bn,” said Jonathan Turner, a geologist with Nuclear Waste Services. The ceiling – for now – is £53bn. “It’s a major project,” Turner said, “like the Chunnel or the Olympics.” At the moment, Nuclear Waste Services is in discussions with four communities about the potential to host a GDF. Three are in Cumbria, and if the GDF does wind up in this neighbourhood, the Sellafield enterprise would have come full circle. The GDF will effectively entomb not just decades of nuclear waste but also the decades-old idea that atomic energy will be both easy and cheap – the very idea that drove the creation of Sellafield, where the world’s earliest nuclear aspirations began. On one of my afternoons in Sellafield, I was shown around a half-made building: a £1bn factory that would pack all the purified plutonium into canisters to be sent to a GDF. We ducked through half-constructed corridors and emerged into the main, as-yet-roofless hall. Eventually, the plant will be taller than Westminster Abbey – and as part of the decommissioning process, this structure too will be torn down once it has finished its task, decades from now. I stood there for a while, transfixed by the sight of a building going up even as its demolition was already foretold, feeling the water-filled coolness of the fresh, metre-thick concrete walls, and trying to imagine the distant, dreamy future in which all of Sellafield would be returned to fields and meadows again. • This article was amended on 16 December 2022.

The London Sinfonietta’s 1991 recording, with Dawn Upshaw a radiant soloist, topped the US classical chart for more than 40 weeks. Clearly the work’s contemplative sincerity struck a chord in a post-iron curtain world. The Polish-born composer had commenced his career embracing a gnarly, post-Webern serialism. His shift to sparer textures and Renaissance-inspired harmonies went down like a lead balloon with modernists - Pierre Boulez was heard summing up the Third Symphony at its 1977 premiere in a single word: “Merde!” Górecki didn’t care. He’d witnessed war first-hand and had visited Auschwitz in 1945. His musical triptych on motherhood and suffering clearly resonates with Isabella Bywater, who has staged the piece for English National Opera. Set inside what at first appears to be a granitic geometric wedge, she conjures a series of snapshots of women coping with loss. The opening scene reveals a mother kneeling at a grave (American soprano Nicole Chevalier plays all three women). Her son floats above her, suspended between heaven and earth. As rumbling double basses commence Górecki’s long, ascending crescendo, the charcoal-grey walls appear to melt and flow. Roberto Vitalini’s mesmeric video design and Jon Driscoll’s haunting lighting are major elements in the production’s success, as is Bywater’s set. In a visual sleight of hand, her concrete walls turn out to be a closely knit mesh curtain of ropes through which actors can enter and exit. The imagery is often stunning. In the opening scene, the grieving mother gathers in reams of graveclothes, which she swaddles like a baby. Later, she rises to the ceiling on a chair before tumbling to earth in a graceful slow-motion swan dive. In the following scene, a woman sings words scrawled by a teenage girl on the walls of a Gestapo prison cell in 1942. Embraced by a pair of sinister, hooded figures, she’s dragged away to a despairing “Hail Mary, full of grace”. In the final scene, the jagged tangle of ropes suggests an all-too-familiar modern war zone. Here, a woman searches for the body of her son as faceless soldiers topple around her. It’s visceral stuff, and powerfully sung by Chevalier whose luxurious soprano sails through Górecki’s long lyrical lines. In the pit, Lidiya Yankovskaya leads a refreshingly unsentimental reading of the score. Just occasionally, the production might have benefited from greater stillness – the music, after all, proves the work can take it – but this is an affecting piece of contemporary music theatre from a resurgent opera company thinking outside the box. Symphony of Sorrowful Songs is at the London Coliseum until 6 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T20:58:14Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: solar soothes power prices, gamblers face credit card ban, Jerry Springer dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone. “People should not be betting with money they do not have,” says the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, as she makes a strong case for the government’s attempt to ban gamblers from topping up their wagering accounts with credit cards.

Full Story Fox News and the consequences of lies, with Lenore Taylor After a busy week for the Murdoch family in the US, Britain and Australia, editor-in-chief Lenore Taylor and head of news Mike Ticher discuss the News Corp empire, Fox News and the media. In-depth It’s not even summer in the northern hemisphere but Asian countries such as China, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam have seen record temperatures for the time of year. The continent has already endured weeks of “endless record heat”, forcing the closure of schools and surges in energy use. In Europe, the Spanish government has advised people to take extra care as the drought-hit country experiences its own record-breaking temperatures, which could result in an unprecedented April temperature of 39C in some parts of Andalucía today.

One of Florida’s notorious and plentiful green invasive iguanas wreaked chaos earlier this week in one city after scuttling into an electricity substation in Lake Worth Beach and somehow causing a huge power cut. The authorities announced a “large scale outage” on Wednesday after an iguana “came into contact” with a transformer at the station. The power fried, and so did the lizard. “[Lake Worth Beach] Electric Utility is currently responding to a large scale outage caused by an iguana at our 6th Ave Substation,” the city tweeted just before noon on Wednesday. “This outage is effecting customers in the South East area of our service territory. Our teams are working hard to repair the damage and restore the system.” The power was restored not long afterwards but one woman commenting on the city’s Facebook post said the iguana in her neighborhood “went up under the transformer or something but he blew it and he fried”. The Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission considers the iguana invasive – they are native to Central America and parts of South America and some Caribbean islands. But they are omnipresent in south Florida and can grow to more than 5ft long. The reptiles are notorious for disrupting traffic and digging under structures – and for dropping, catatonic, out of trees in cold weather. They are also good swimmers, have a big appetite and are also appetizing to humans who have a taste for their meat. Cities such as Miami Beach that once saw little to no non-native reptile activity have been overwhelmed by the proliferation of the large, spiny lizards that damage buildings by digging burrows underneath, devastate plants and landscaping, and defecate at will. The authorities are trying various ways to dent their numbers. Meanwhile, in Lake Worth Beach, a city spokesman, Ben Kerr, told local TV that iguanas have a tendency to get into electricity substations and cause damage. While extra precautions have been taken, he said: “They are so big they basically straddle the [power] lines” and shimmy into places where they don’t belong. In this case, the iguana’s zapped remains were removed by workers and with a bit of repair work the city’s lights came back on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T17:50:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear energy push is not powered by sense | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","fields":{"bodyText":"There is much about this government’s – and, to its shame, Labour’s – newfound love affair with nuclear power that makes no sense (Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of electricity from nuclear power, 21 March). First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it? John French Brockweir, Gloucestershire • Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.” Andrew Warren Chairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation • The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C. How is spending more than five times as much on a controversial power source that takes 10 years to build a good idea?

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Tuesday that Iran was also planning a massive expansion of its enrichment capacity. Iran said earlier on Tuesday that it had started to enrich uranium to 60% at the Fordo site, having already done so at its above-ground pilot plant at Natanz for more than a year. The increased enrichment was seen as a significant addition to its nuclear programme. Enrichment to 60% purity is one short technical step away from weapons grade, 90%. Nonproliferation experts have warned in recent months that Iran has enough 60% enriched uranium to reprocess into fuel for at least one nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied any ambition to develop a nuclear bomb, insisting its nuclear activities are for civilian purposes. The move was part of Iran’s response to the UN nuclear watchdog’s adoption last week of a censure motion drafted by western governments accusing it of non-cooperation. It also comes as talks have stalled to revive a 2015 landmark deal that curbed Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal started to unravel in 2018 when the US withdrew and reimposed sanctions. In response, Iran started to step up its nuclear programme. A joint statement from Germany, France and Britain – the three western European countries that remain in the Iran nuclear deal – condemned Iran’s latest action to further expand its nuclear programme. “Iran’s step is a challenge to the global non-proliferation system,” the statement on Tuesday said. “This step, which carries significant proliferation-related risks, has no credible civilian justification.” This month, the IAEA has said it believes Iran has further increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. As recently as last week, the agency criticised Tehran for continuing to bar its officials from accessing or monitoring Iranian nuclear sites. A separate report said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, was “seriously concerned” that Iran had still not engaged with the agency’s inquiry into manmade uranium particles found at three undeclared sites. The issue has become a key sticking point in the talks for a renewed nuclear deal. It has been nearly two years since IAEA officials have had full access to monitor Iran’s nuclear sites, and five months since IAEA surveillance equipment was removed.

Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s ground forces commander has said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed. President Zelenskiy posted a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, has said he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since early in the invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Grossi said, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. President Zelenskiy visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia on Monday, his office said, during a visit to one of the partly occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”, his office said. The 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border, according to a report. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, Der Spiegel reported, citing unnamed sources. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow had made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent the Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and the billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If confirmed genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions. Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. Video released by a Russian assault unit details what they describe as ‘criminal’ commands to block a retreat following 14 days of nonstop mortar fire and shelling. Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard describing the conditions of the Storm group, which initially had 161 members, in an appeal to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Read the full story here: A United Nations expert advising the International Olympic Committee has provoked outrage by claiming that Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine should be allowed to compete at the Paris 2024 Games – as long as they have not committed war crimes. Alexandra Xanthaki, the UN special rapporteur for cultural rights, angered Ukrainian athletes on an IOC‑hosted call by saying that only Russians implicated directly in crimes against humanity or propaganda for war should be barred from international sport. “I don’t think that it makes sense to exclude all Russian soldiers and all Russian military,” Xanthaki told athlete representatives from most of the 206 national Olympic committees. It is discriminatory because there were a lot of other athletes [from other countries] … in active military operations and they were never excluded. However, every athlete has to be excluded if they are found guilty of atrocity, of serious human rights violations in times of war, including crimes against humanity and genocide. And also they can be excluded if they are found guilty of propaganda for war but on an individual basis. It is unclear how far the IOC will follow her advice at an executive board meeting on Tuesday, which is expected to offer updated guidelines to sports about how Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for Paris. The Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was on the call, said: Her comments sounded pretty insane. And it was clear from the questions she received that many others were shocked that she was advocating a way for Russians to compete despite their illegal war. Heraskevych, who held up a sign saying “No war in Ukraine” at the Winter Olympics last year before the invasion of his country, said Xanthaki’s knowledge of sport also appeared limited. Read the full story here: Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of a Russian missile strike in Ukraine’s eastern city of Sloviansk. At least two people have been killed and 29 wounded by Monday’s attack, according to the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing the Nordic country one step closer to becoming a full member of the western military alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and only six against with no abstentions, ending months of foot-dragging by the ruling Fidesz party on the issue. With Hungary’s approval, Turkey is now the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession. The bill on Sweden’s Nato accession remains stranded in the Hungarian parliament. Video released by Ukraine’s presidential office and the country’s emergency services show destruction in the eastern city of Sloviansk after a deadly strike by Russian forces, which killed at least two people and injured dozens more. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, local leader Pavlo Kyrylenko said in an online statement. The city is in the partly occupied Donetsk region, the scene of fierce fighting since the start of the war more than a year ago. A German foreign ministry spokesperson has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Russia will station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus as “irresponsible” and “escalatory”. Berlin sees Moscow’s announcement as “another attempt at nuclear intimidation and we consider this rhetoric to be irresponsible and expressly reject it,” Andrea Sasse told reporters in Berlin. She added: We will, of course, not be swayed in our course of supporting Ukraine in its self-defence. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Sasse also dismissed a report about the imminent expulsion of 30 Russian diplomats, saying “such a measure is currently not planned”. A giant recruitment advert for Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has appeared on an office building next to a highway in north-east Moscow, showing the group’s logo and slogans such as “Join the winning team!” and “Together we will win”. Wagner, which is thought to have sustained heavy losses in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, has sought to replenish troops before a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Iuliia Mendel, a former spokesperson for Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shared a video clip of the Ukrainian president meeting troops in frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia earlier today. Zelenskiy said he held a meeting to discuss the “operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons” during his visit to Zaporizhzhia region. Members of a recently formed Russian assault unit say their commanders deployed troops to stop them from retreating and threatened them with death after they suffered “huge” losses in eastern Ukraine. In a video addressed to President Vladimir Putin, a group of about two dozen men in military uniform say they are the remnants of Storm, a unit under the defence ministry. “We sat under open mortar fire and artillery for 14 days,” Alexander Gorin, a Russian soldier, is heard saying in the appeal, which first appeared on Friday on Russian Telegram channels. We took huge losses. Thirty-four people were injured and 22 died, including our commander. Another soldier said the unit initially comprised 161 men at the start of the operations. Gorin said his men made the decision to head back to the Russian army headquarters but were denied evacuation by their superiors: They placed barrier troops behind us and weren’t letting us leave our position … They are threatening to destroy us one by one and as a unit. They want to execute us as witnesses of a completely negligent criminal leadership. Read the full story by my colleague Pjotr Sauer here: It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

An attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol, according to Russian state media. A Russian-installed official in the occupied territory was cited by state-run Tass news agency as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The Kremlin said it was for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed.

Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian media last week published a 30-minute leaked phone conversation allegedly between the prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and the Russian leadership. Akhmedov, a former Russian senator, has been targeted by western sanctions for his proximity to the Kremlin regime, while Prigozhin (no relation to Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin) is seen as a longtime supporter of the Kremlin. “There’s no doubt about the fact that they fucked up the country,” a man whose voice closely resembles that of Prigozhin’s says on the recording. The same man also refers to Putin’s inner circle as “washed-up lowlifes” who act as if they are “gods”. “He is Satan. Totally vacuous,” Akhmedov allegedly said of Putin. He screwed all of us over. Everyone and everything. The entire country. The entire population, for fuck’s sake. It was not possible to independently verify the clip’s veracity, Prigozhin on Sunday called the audio a “provocation” aimed at “creating a split” within the Russian elites. While initially calling the clip “fake news”, Prigozhin in a later reaction said that the clip contained “some real moments” from his conversation with Akhmedov. “The voice is similar to mine. But it is not clear how the call was glued together. We need to figure it out,” the producer said. Akhmedov has not yet commented on the recording. If confirmed genuine, the audio provides a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites, many of whom have privately voiced their opposition towards the war. Der Spiegel is reporting that the 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks promised by Germany to support Ukraine have been handed over at the Ukrainian border. About 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles have also reached Ukraine, the report added, citing unnamed sources. In January, the German government announced it would supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine, overcoming misgivings about sending heavy weaponry that Kyiv sees as crucial to defeat the Russian invasion. Berlin’s decision paved the way for other countries to re-export some of their German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said on Monday he had met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Zaporizhzhia, the region that houses Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. The power plant has been occupied by Russian forces since almost the very beginning of the Russian invasion. The two had a “rich exchange” on the protection of the plant and its staff, Reuters reports that Grossi wrote in a tweet, adding that he reiterated the IAEA’s full support for Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Adding to his previous message on Telegram, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given his account of a meeting held while he was visiting to Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s president posted: Meeting on the situation in Zaporizhzhia: operational situation, readiness of military units to perform assigned tasks, socioeconomic situation in the region, meeting the needs of internally displaced persons. The regional leadership of the security service and the national police of Ukraine delivered reports. We are working and keeping all important issues under control. The first images have come in of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Zaporizhzhia region today. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited frontline positions in Zaporizhzhia today. Citing the president’s office, it said Ukraine’s president “visited advanced positions in the Zaporizhzhia region, learned about the operational situation, and presented awards to the military”. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as part of its own territory. Zelenskiy himself posted to his Telegram channel a video clip of him meeting soldiers, alongside the message: I visited the command post of the “Zaporizhzhia” operational group of troops. I presented orders and medals to employees of the security service of Ukraine, the national guard, the national police, the state border guard service, and the state emergency service of Ukraine. Thank you for protecting our state, our homes, territorial integrity and life in Ukraine. I wish you good health. I wish you a great victory and it will definitely come true. Here are some drone images from Bakhmut that were released at the weekend showing the extent of the destruction of the city, which had a population of about 70,000 before the start of the war. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian-appointed social worker in the liberated eastern city of Lyman to five years in prison after finding her guilty of collaborating with Russian authorities, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. The unnamed accountant at Lyman’s department of social protection and labour was accused of registering a local tax office, treasury and social insurance fund with the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, as well as recruiting workers and paying them salaries in rubles. Ukrainian forces recaptured Lyman in September, after which the official was arrested. Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, has warned that Moscow has the weapons to destroy any enemy, including the US, if its own existence is threatened. Patrushev, in an interview with the state Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, said: American politicians trapped by their own propaganda remain confident that, in the event of a direct conflict with Russia, the United States is capable of launching a preventive missile strike, after which Russia will no longer be able to respond. This is shortsighted stupidity, and very dangerous. He added: Russia is patient and does not intimidate anyone with its military advantage. But it has modern unique weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in the event of a threat to its existence. A quick snap from Reuters: the Kremlin has denied Turkish reports that Vladimir Putin planned to visit the Turkish capital, Ankara. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, also used his visit to the UK to call for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate Russia’s war crimes. “We want to use all the legal mechanisms to make sure Russia is defeated legally, held accountable for all the crimes they commit in Ukraine,” he said, adding that the crimes were “not real if they are not prosecuted”. Addressing MPs and peers, he called for the UK to recognise the Soviet-era Holodomor famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the winter of 1932-33 as genocide, and said it was “connected” to today’s crimes. The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, welcomed his Ukrainian counterpart to Westminster, telling him: “Our parliament is your parliament.” He added: Ukrainian politicians play a vital role in serving their people and telling the world the reality of war. We are a friend that will listen, we are a friend that will support and continue to support. Ukraine is ready to send its pilots to be trained in using western fighter jets, the chairman of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of President Volodymyr Zekenskiy’s speech to the British parliament last month. He said: We are ready for more intense training of Ukrainian servicemen. We’re ready to send our pilots to be trained in fighter jets. We keep saying ‘please give us your experience’. He also thanked the UK for its decision to send 14 Challenger 2 tanks, which paved the way for other nations to follow suit. He added: Today is the time for Britain to become a leader to also open the door to use aircraft and long-range rockets. At least two people have been killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the Donetsk regional military administration, said in a Facebook update. A number of high-rise buildings and offices were also damaged or destroyed, he said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier said that one person had died in the shelling in Sloviansk. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukraine presidency’s office, has tweeted about the meeting with the Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor, Orlando Bloom. A Russian diplomat has said Moscow may seek compensation for the damage to the Nord Stream gas pipelines caused by two explosions last September, according to state media. The pipelines are multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects designed to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. They were ruptured by unexplained blasts that Moscow has – without providing evidence – accused the west of being responsible for. The US and Nato have called the incident “an act of sabotage”. Dmitry Birichevsky, head of the Russian foreign ministry’s department for economic cooperation, told state-owned Ria Novosti news agency: We do not rule out later raising the issue of compensation for damage as a result of the explosion. He did not say who Russia would seek damages from, but added: At the moment, it’s very difficult to speak about the future of the Nord Stream pipeline system. On the whole, according to experts, the damaged lines could be restored. The Kremlin has said it is for all shareholders to decide whether the two pipelines should be mothballed. Russia would establish who was behind the blasts before claiming any compensation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said today. Peskov said: For now, the data indicates that such a large-scale act of sabotage and a terrorist attack against critical infrastructure could not have been carried out without the participation of the state and special state services. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires from the frontline near the besieged city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: “Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided.” Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rocket salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in populated areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” RIA reported that Ukrainian forces shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it said, without specifying further. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between itself and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland said on Monday, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. “We strongly believe that now is not the time to consider the opening up of a pathway for Russian and Belarusian athletes to return to the Olympic Games in any status,” Reuters reports the Polish foreign ministry said in a statement. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying reports that an attempt was made this morning to assassinate the police chief in occupied Mariupol. It quotes a Russian-installed official in the occupied territory as saying: “In the morning they blew up the car of police chief Mikhail Moskvin. He is alive, everything is in order.” The source informed Tass that the car exploded a few metres away from the police chief. There have also been explosions reported in occupied Melitopol, which Vladimir Rogov, a local Russian-installed leader, ascribed to the work of air defence. The claims have not been independently verified. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors said on Monday. Reuters reports prosecutors in the northern Polish city of Gdansk said in a statement that the suspect was detained on 21 March. “The findings made in the case show that the suspect acted for the benefit of Russian intelligence by obtaining and collecting information … on critical infrastructure in the Pomeranian and Kuyavian-Pomeranian regions, and on the activities of services and bodies responsible for security,” they said. “The information obtained was passed on to the Russian intelligence service,” the statement added. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. The state-owned Russian news agency RIA reports on Telegram that Ukrainian forces have shelled the Kalininsky district in the occupied city of Donetsk. “There are victims,” it reports, without specifying further. A video clip appears to show smoke rising over the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to his official Telegram about the death of at least one person in an attack on Slovyansk. Ukraine’s president wrote: Another day that began with terrorism by the Russian Federation. The aggressor state shelled our Slovyansk. Unfortunately, there is a dead person and victims of various degrees of severity. All services are working on the ground. Help is being provided. Debris clearance is ongoing. The enemy must know: Ukraine will not forgive the torturing of our people, will not forgive these deaths and wounds. All Russian terrorists will be defeated. Everyone involved in this aggression will be held to account. The message was accompanied by a short video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarus is accusing Poland of heightening tensions between the country and the EU by deliberately slowing the movement of trucks and cars at its border. Belarus says Poland is failing to implement bilateral agreements. “Since Friday, a queue in front of the only accessible border crossing point on the Belarusian-Polish border, Kozłowiczy, has doubled in size and now totals 1,000 cars,” Reuters reports the country’s border committee said. Ukraine’s ground forces commander said on Monday his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi had acted during a visit to the eastern frontline to solve “problematic issues that prevent effective execution of combat tasks” and taken “operational decisions aimed at strengthening our capabilities to deter and inflict damage on the enemy”. It gave no details, and did not say when the visit took place, but Syrskyi’s comments signalled Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll there. “The most intense phase of the battle for Bakhmut continues. The situation is constantly difficult. The enemy suffers significant losses in human resources, weapons and military equipment but continues to conduct offensive actions,” he said. Praising Ukrainian forces’ resilience in “extremely difficult conditions”, he said: “The defence of Bakhmut is due to military necessity … We are calculating all possible options for the development of events, and will react adequately to the current situation”. The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, has said Nato countries are party to the conflict in Ukraine, according to excerpts from an interview with the Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Monday. Reuters reports Rossiyskaya Gazeta quoted Patrushev as saying: “In fact, Nato countries are a party to the conflict. They made Ukraine one big military camp. They send weapons and ammunition to the Ukrainian troops, provide them with intelligence”. The deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria may hold consultations in Moscow in early April, Reuters reports, citing RIA. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that yesterday Russian forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia region 14 times. Zaporizhzhia is one of the partially occupied regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation claims to have annexed as its own territory. Russian forces launched two missile strikes, 23 airstrikes and 38 attacks from rock salvo systems against Ukrainian troops and infrastructure in popular areas, according to the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. In its latest update, it claimed Russian forces are focusing their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in the Kupyansk, Lymansk, Bakhmutsk, Avdiivsk and Marinsk directions, with Ukrainian soldiers claiming to have repelled more than 60 enemy attacks. The Ukrainian air force made three strikes on Russian troops. Ukrainian missile and artillery units also claimed attacks on a command post, four Russian troop concentrations, weapons and military equipment, a radio-electronic ware station and an ammunition depot. The claims have not been independently verified. Unicef goodwill ambassador and British actor Orlando Bloom has met President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to promote the organisation’s humanitarian work in Ukraine. During the meeting, Bloom said he was “impressed” by the courage and resilience of Ukrainians and Zelenskiy welcomed the work of Unicef, saying the safety of children and their development remain a priority of his government. Bloom also visited Irpin and the village of Demydiv during his tour. Unicef is working to develop a statement to care for children whose parents have been killed in the war and infrastructure for early childhood development, youth projects and start-ups. Russia plans to complete coastal infrastructure needed to host nuclear submarines in the Pacific Ocean, Tass news agency reported on Monday. The nuclear submarines will be capable of carrying the Poseidon nuclear-capable super torpedos first produced in January, four years after they were announced. There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon in the public domain, but it is essentially a cross between a torpedo and a drone which can be launched from a nuclear submarine. The torpedoes are being developed for deployment on the Belgorod and Khabarovsk nuclear submarines, Tass reported. Russia Pacific Fleet’s ballistic nuclear missile submarine base is located on the south-eastern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, in the Russian far east. The Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk make up the Kamchatka Peninsula’s eastern and western coastlines. The Tass state agency reported that a new division is being formed as part of the submarine forces of the Pacific Fleet, which will include not only Belgorod and Khabarovsk but also other submarines. The new special-purpose submarines will participate in solving the tasks “of strategic deterrence”. Reuters With the cost of reconstruction in Ukraine projected by the World Bank to be $411bn, economist Adam Tooze has examined the changes to the Ukrainian economy that have been forced on it over the course of the invasion. To secure ongoing support from international institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Tooze notes the Ukrainian government has committed to deep and widespread reforms that would cut labor protections and introduce austerity measures across the economy. Quoting other sources, Tooze writes that Ukraine has “outsourced” most functions of its government beyond what is needed to carry out the military defence of the country - and that this “nightmarish” decision will have consequences for civil society over the long run. A policy of dramatic fiscal austerity that comes at the expense of the fabric of Ukrainian society and the state will have huge long-run costs. The EU, the United States and other outside supporters can soften this dilemma best a. by providing more generous funding and b. by urging Kyiv towards a strategy of civilian as well as military state-building, not by replacing domestic national institutions with international agencies, but by promoting the mobilization of local institutions and agencies. The U.N. nuclear watchdog head will not travel to Russia this week, but a visit is possible in the near future, Russian news agency RIA reported early on Monday, citing Moscow’s permanent representative to international organisations in Vienna. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi announced on Saturday that he would visit the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine this week to assess the serious situation there. When asked if Russia planned to invite Grossi to Moscow in the near future, permanent representative Mikhail Ulyanov said that was “quite realistic”, according to RIA. Not next week, but somewhat later, the visit of Rafael Grossi to Russia may well take place. Grossi is pressing for a security zone to be erected around Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant with six reactors, which has come under repeated shelling during the 13-month war Russia has been waging against its neighbour. - Reuters The ISW also said the continuing of offences around Bakhmut and Avdiivka have become “not merely pointless, but actually harmful to Russian preparations for the next phase of this week”. It said the loss of manpower and equipment means Russian forces will not gain any operational advantage from taking either Bakhmut and Avdiivka as they will be “unable to exploit such advances”. Putin’s continuation of these Russian offensive operations in the current operational and strategic context amounts to strategic malfeasance. It expends scarce Russian combat power in pursuit of operationally meaningless gains rather than setting conditions to receive and defeat a Ukrainian counter-offensive that everyone appears to expect imminently. However, the ISW said Putin’s “stubbornness” could make sense “in a protracted conflict during which western support for Ukraine wanes or ends”. Putin might even mean these operations to set conditions for a negotiated settlement on terms he has already articulated that include international recognition of Russia’s annexation of all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts; Ukrainian “neutrality”; the “de-militarization” of Ukraine; and the “de-Nazification” of the Ukrainian government. The ISW said “multiple major Ukrainian operational-level victories” would be necessary to create “any prospect of a negotiated settlement of the current conflict or forcing Putin to accept unfavorable militaries realities, absent a formal settlement”. The Institute for the Study of War says even a successful series of Ukrainian counteracts may not be enough to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the conflict. In an abbreviated update, the ISW says Putin remains committed to carrying out the military campaign in an effort to “seek complete victory in Ukraine”. Putin instead remains focused on achieving his initial war aims through protracted conflict in which he wins either by imposing his will on Ukraine by force or by breaking Ukraine’s will following the West’s abandonment of Kyiv. It said “multiple successful Ukrainian counteroffensives are almost certainly necessary but not sufficient” to persuade Putin to enter into a negotiation for the end of the war. Instead the Russian President appears to be “doubling down” on the war by continuing to mobilising his country’s industrial base and relying on various shadow-mobilisation schemes to generate the necessary combat power. Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian president’s suggestions that the move would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. For more on this story, read the full report by Dan Sabbagh, Sam Jones and Julian Borger. Nato says Vladimir Putin’s plan to station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is “dangerous and irresponsible” and a threat to Russia’s nuclear non-proliferation commitments. Putin likened his Belarus plan on Saturday to the US stationing its weapons in Europe, insisting Russia would not violate its nuclear non-proliferation promises. The move, while not unexpected, is one of Russia’s most pronounced nuclear signals yet and a warning to Nato over its military support for Ukraine. Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said on Sunday: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible”. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own.” Putin’s non-proliferation pledge and his description of US weapons deployment overseas were way off the mark, she added. Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments. Experts said Russia’s move was significant since it had until now been proud that unlike the US, it did not deploy nuclear weapons outside its borders. It may be the first time since the mid-1990s that it has done so. Reuters Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Nato has criticised Russia for its “dangerous and irresponsible” nuclear rhetoric after Vladimir Putin said Russia would station tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Ukraine has reacted to Russia’s plans by calling for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. The head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council has said that the Kremlin has taken Belarus as a “nuclear hostage”. More on that shortly. Elsewhere, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged Ukrainians to remain engaged in the war, even though fighting has largely been concentrated in the east. Over the last 24 hours, Zelenskiy has met with security services, intelligence and defence to discuss reinforcement and “prepare respective steps”. He also said Ukraine has received €1.5bn in macro-financial assistance from the European Union. Meanwhile heavy Russian shelling is turning the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka into a “place from post-apocalyptic movies”, according to the city’s military administration head, Vitaliy Barabash. Reuters reported about 2,000 civilians were left in the city that Ukrainian forces said last week could become a “second Bakhmut”. The city’s prewar population numbered 30,000. In other developments: The UN Nuclear watching head will not visit Russia this week, but another visit is possible in the future. International Atomic Energy Agency Director announced on Sunday he would visit the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in occupied-Ukraine, but said a visit to Russia was being planned for “somewhat later”. Zelenskiy said the Croatian government had adopted a programme to treat wounded Ukrainian soldiers. The number of Russian troops in Belarus has decreased to about 4,000, according to Ukraine. Andriy Demchenko, spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service, said there had been 10,000 in January. The majority of those remaining were training, with the rest transferred back to Russia. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, has cautioned Belarus against hosting Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions.” The US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said on Sunday: “We have not seen any indication that he [Putin] has made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around.” Three people were reported injured and three residential buildings were damaged after an explosion in the town of Kireyevsk in Russia’s Tula region. Local law enforcement attributed the blast to a Ukrainian Tu-141 Strizh UAV drone “packed with explosives”. None of the people hurt in the blast were believed to have suffered life-threatening injuries, Reuters reported, citing Russian news agencies.

Global Energy Monitor, a San Francisco-based NGO, said insufficient progress was being made to avoid “climate chaos” and that plans for a sharp increase in the number of coal-fired plants in China would require even steeper cuts to the rest of the global fleet to meet the world’s climate goals. In order to meet the Paris climate agreement, all coal-fired plants need to be closed by 2040 and no new ones can come online. Developed economies are expected to shut their plants a decade earlier than the global phaseout. This will require countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to close 60 gigawatts of coal-power capacityeach year until 2030 – about four-and-a-half times the amount recorded last year. Non-OECD countries will need to close 91GW of coal power capacity every year until 2040. The global survey found that although the total amount of existing and planned coal plant capacity outside China fell last year, the phaseout has slowed compared with previous years. China is also preparing to drastically increase its usage of coal, with plans to build enough new plants to more than offset the capacity retired across the US and the EU combined last year. “At this rate, the transition away from existing and new coal isn’t happening fast enough to avoid climate chaos,” said Flora Champenois, the lead author of the report and project manager for Global Energy Monitor’s global coal plant tracker. “The more new coal projects come online, the steeper the cuts and commitments need to be in the future.” Overall, the world’s existing fleet grew by 19.5GW last year, of which more than half was commissioned in China. The country also has plans to increase its coal power capacity by a further 126GW – dwarfing reductions in usage made in developing countries. The US took the global lead in retiring coal power, shutting 13.5GW of capacity last year. In the EU, closures slowed from 14.6GW of capacity in 2021 to 2.2GW in 2022, as the bloc responded to the war in Ukraine driving up the cost of gas-fired power generation. “Progress in retiring coal power plants in rich countries and cancelling new coal power projects in developing countries, despite the gas crunch that shook global energy markets in 2022, is encouraging,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, the lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a thinktank. “Outside of China, the response to the energy crisis was dominated by investment in clean energy. However, that progress urgently needs to be accelerated. China pulled in the opposite direction, sharply increasing planned coal power capacity, showing the need to deploy clean solutions and better enforcement of existing policies that should restrict new coal power projects,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-07T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Hunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","fields":{"bodyText":"The Hunterston B nuclear power station will shut down for ever at noon on Friday after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing for the sector. The plant, on the west coast of Scotland, provided one gigawatt of the UK’s 7.9GW nuclear capacity, enough to power to 1.7m homes. But Hunterston B has lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date and is one of several nuclear power plants being taken out of commission within several years of each other. The rapid pace of the decommissioning schedule has raised concerns about maintaining electricity generation. About 20% of Britain’s supply is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors, which help provide a constant baseload to make up for shortfalls when electricity generation from renewables drops on windless days or when the sun is not shining. Almost half of the country’s nuclear capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. While more renewable energy will have been brought online by then and other fuel sources such as gas can fill in the gaps, the remaining 3.6GW of nuclear capacity would only be able to meet 6% of peak demand forecast for this winter. At its peak between 1995 and 1999, nuclear capacity hit nearly 13GW, about a quarter of the UK’s electricity needs. EDF is due to finish its 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C, Britain’s first new nuclear power station in 20 years, by 2027. The first of its two reactors is scheduled to come online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association, which represents companies across the civil nuclear supply chain, estimates that the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. Development is likely to hinge upon government plans for a new financial framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, which would lock in higher returns for institutions funding nuclear plants and transfer risk to taxpayers. The NIA’s projection for the growth of nuclear also depends on the scale of the rollout of Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactors (SMRs), which have received £210m of government funds and £280m from private capital. The association criticised a decision by the Scottish government to bar new nuclear projects in Scotland, saying the gap left by Hunterston B would have to be filled in part with imported gas sourced from volatile global markets. This would drive up consumer bills, hamper emissions reduction plans and threaten Scotland’s energy security, it added. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: “Hunterston B has shown the best of what nuclear can provide for Scotland – clean, reliable power to keep the lights on and save our planet, and long-term, skilled jobs on which people can build a life and a family. “The dedicated staff who have helped keep Scottish homes warm and light for 46 years deserve our gratitude. As the current energy crisis demonstrates, without nuclear the cost of the electricity we rely on is higher, causes pollution and leaves us reliant on burning imported fossil fuels. That’s why we need new nuclear – to get to net zero and provide the reliable, secure and clean power to live our lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/19/labors-history-is-one-of-compromise-and-anthony-albanese-knows-to-make-lasting-change-he-needs-to-stay-in-government","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T15:00:53Z","webTitle":"Labor’s history is one of compromise – and its conference delivered it in response to Albanese's call for a decade in power | Paul Karp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/19/labors-history-is-one-of-compromise-and-anthony-albanese-knows-to-make-lasting-change-he-needs-to-stay-in-government","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/19/labors-history-is-one-of-compromise-and-anthony-albanese-knows-to-make-lasting-change-he-needs-to-stay-in-government","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese is famous for his mantra of wanting to “fight Tories”. But the member for Grayndler, centred on the people’s republic of Marrickville, has proven just as adept fighting for decades on Labor’s left flank against the Greens and internal progressive disappointment. Albanese’s keynote address to the party’s national conference on Thursday was all about the Labor virtue of making lasting change by retaining government. Albanese presented “a plan for progress over the next decade”, arguing unity and electoral success will be “the difference between a moment of progress – or a lifetime of opportunity”. With Labor holding just a two-seat majority in the House of Representatives and the Greens spoiling for fights to win the votes of the one-third of Australians who rent, Albanese seemed acutely aware the next election will be fought on two fronts. There were a few elbows thrown in Peter Dutton’s direction, labelling the Coalition “reactionaries” and accusing them of “telling Australians with solar panels on their roofs to make room for a nuclear reactor in their back yard”. But much of the speech was an attack on the Greens. Albanese accused them of “hypocrisy” for blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) and opposing housing developments. The prime minister argued Labor’s aim of “bringing people together, in the national interest” in the political centre-ground “might not suit the agenda of those who prefer protest to progress”. Essentially, it is a core Labor value to compromise to get things done. Party conference delegates got the memo, and compromise they did. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The construction union, which had pushed for a super profits tax to pay for housing, settled for the vague commitment to “funding from a progressive and sustainable tax system, including corporate tax reform”. Note the language: just strong enough to imply Labor will be slugging corporate fat cats; just weak enough to argue existing policies to crack down on multinational tax avoidance fulfil the commitment. The Labor Environment Action Network (Lean) wanted a ban on native forest logging but instead got a commitment to rewrite the three-decades-old national forest policy statement this term. Lean’s spokesperson, Felicity Wade, warned in the failure to ban native forest logging “we prove ourselves a little bit deaf to the deep environmental concerns of our members”. The Electrical Trades Union got a promise of “substantial public investment” in renewable electricity including expanded state ownership, but out came the hard numbers calling for hundreds of billions of investment. Disputes on defence and foreign affairs were set to be the hottest, but were effectively stage-managed. The Labor right’s ambition to remove a call to recognise Palestine as an “important priority” was balanced against the Labor left’s goal of strengthening the commitment and hastening its delivery. Nobody officially moved to do either. Leftwing unions and rank-and-file members got to have their say against the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition, but the party locked in behind the policy. When things got rowdy, with frequent interjections from the observers’ section, one of the delegates turned around and shouted: “Join the Greens.” Labor’s support for Aukus is one plank of what Albanese described as “demonstrating [its] responsible approach on everything from the economy to foreign policy and national security”. Labor’s history is one of compromise. Even the socialist objective added to its constitution in 1921 qualified the ambitious promise of “democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange” with the loophole “to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other antisocial features in these fields”. The Greens are less keen on compromise. After grinding out deals in return for their support for a 43% emissions reduction target and the safeguard mechanism to help achieve it, the party is still fighting for a ban on new fossil fuel projects. The $10bn Haff is stalled in the Senate. The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, is still denouncing Labor and claiming it is responsible for “unlimited rent rises” despite national cabinet this week limiting rises to one a year. In July 2022 Labor’s national secretary, Paul Erickson, paid the Greens a compliment in his post-election National Press Club address, describing them as “an effective campaign machine”. “And they do have a very successful strategy they’ve honed over 20 years,” he said in answer to a question. “To always position themselves two steps to the left of Labor, minimise our successes, give zero credit for progressive gains made by Labor governments, constantly criticise, and divide Labor’s base in a manner that doesn’t help progressive politics.” With the Greens primary vote hovering in the low double digits, according to polls, it’s unclear whether voters will be fired up by Chandler-Mather’s rent freeze campaign or agree with Albanese that the minor party isn’t “interested in solving the problem” because they just want the fight. At a left faction dinner on Thursday, Albanese went further: labelling the Greens’ approach “Maoist”, claiming the minor party aims to force some into impoverishment in the hope they will rebel. “They are the blockers – we are the builders,” Albanese said in his conference speech. Long-term Labor government is the “difference between laying the foundation – and finishing the build”. Albanese vowed to keep the “great Australian dream” of home ownership alive for the next generation, with policies including Labor’s Help to Buy shared equity scheme to start next year and the $3bn incentive to achieve the target of 1.2m homes. Progressives may choose different paths: compromise or criticism. But on emissions reduction and housing affordability, we have metrics for success for the Albanese government seeking a decade of Labor in power. In the case of this affordability crisis the proof of the housing will be in the living. If increased supply and lower rents can’t be delivered the great Australian Labor dream of progressives remaining inside the tent may be lost."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Questions remain over the UK’s nuclear power plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","fields":{"bodyText":"In 2007, Vincent de Rivaz, the then EDF chief executive, said Britain would be “cooking our Christmas turkeys” with electricity from Hinkley Point C nuclear station by 2017. Instead the first concrete was poured that year and the turkey is now scheduled for late 2026. In the race against time to avert dangerous global heating, the UK government has decided to back an untried reactor from Rolls Royce. The first of these could be “plugged into the grid by 2031”, according to Nuclear Industry Association. Internationally average planning time for reactor proposals is 10 years, plus another decade for building, and that is for already proven designs. The 16 planned Rolls Royce reactors are still on the drawing board. The arguments about where they could be sited are beginning. Apart from other possible objections the favoured UK coastal locations are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion and storms. Faced with the well-documented delays and drawbacks to nuclear programmes it is perhaps not surprising that there is no other country taking part in the Cop26 process in Glasgow relying on multiple new nuclear reactors to get to net zero carbon targets by 2050. Even without our plentiful opportunities to exploit wind, solar, wave and tidal power many countries feel they do not need nuclear power to reach their goals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2023/may/22/assassins-creed-mirage-soundtrack-composer","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:59:45Z","webTitle":"How Assassin’s Creed Mirage captured the Islamic golden age – in a disused New York power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/may/22/assassins-creed-mirage-soundtrack-composer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2023/may/22/assassins-creed-mirage-soundtrack-composer","fields":{"bodyText":"“I think, initially, Ubisoft approached me because of my electronic music background – my live career, my albums, my touring. But I didn’t know if I was the right person for the job, you know?” Composer Brendan Angelides has never worked in video game music before. You might know him better as Eskmo or Welder, or perhaps as the mind behind the music of TV shows 13 Reasons Why or Billions. When Ubisoft approached him to be the composer for its sort-of reboot of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, Mirage, he had doubts. The game is set at the height of the Islamic golden age, and centres around Baghdad: a hub flowing with the lifeblood of a changing world, a cultural centre of art and science, old and new. “When I first learned that the new Assassin’s Creed takes place in 9th-century Baghdad, I was excited at the prospect of diving into unfamiliar territory,” he explains to me in the middle of a recording session, where the last organic elements of his score are being finalised by the New York Arabic Orchestra. “It was an opportunity to connect with a community that has a tremendous wealth of talented musicians.” But Angelides does not have Arabic heritage, and did not come into the project with a depth of knowledge about how music from that part of the world works. Ubisoft approached him because of the nature of the work he’d done before; similar to Jesper Kyd – the musical architect of the entire Assassin’s Creed series – Angelides is renowned for fusing the orchestral and the electronic, creating weird electronica that’s powerful enough to capture your attention but understated enough not to overwhelm. Perfect for a video game soundtrack, then. But he needed help. Mirage, like the rest of the Assassin’s Creed series, needed to be as historically authentic as possible … and an electronic composer from Connecticut knew he couldn’t do that by himself. “The first person I reached out to was my friend Emel Mathlouthi, who is a Tunisian artist and performer based in New York,” he says. “The next person I sought out was Layth Sidiq, who is an Iraqi-born Jordanian violinist and the artistic director for the New York Arabic Orchestra.” As we chat, that same orchestra is recording a track for the game behind us, and little teases of the emotive, minor key composition begin to lay the foundations for what this game is about: innocence, tragedy, madness, revenge. Sidiq understood Angelides’ motivations and introduced him to Akram Haddad, a Palestinian composer and orchestrator (currently a professor at the New England Conservatory) teaching Middle Eastern music. It was a match made in heaven: Haddad had taught western music while living in Jerusalem, and now taught Middle Eastern music out of New England. The game – primarily aimed at a western audience – needed to be familiar enough to western ears while incorporating Middle Eastern elements for historical accuracy. Haddad and his work sat at the intersection. We’re sitting in an isolated vocal booth in a disused power station relay in the middle of New York City, and it feels very apt. This studio is at the intersection of art and science, a huge building once used to divert power to downtown New York, hollowed out, now redressed and rebuilt to perfectly capture the sounds of orchestras, rock bands and pop acts from all around the world. The Power Station walls are decorated with albums recorded here: Bowie, Springsteen, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Diana Ross. And now, Assassin’s Creed. “Working with Brendan has been an amazing experience for me,” says Haddad. “He sought me out intentionally as a collaborator, and from the very beginning there was a strong sense of mutual respect and musical admiration.” Haddad notes that Angelides gave him a lot of freedom when letting him loose on the compositions the latter had worked on so far. “Throughout our collaboration, there was a great sense of camaraderie and a shared passion for creating something new and exciting,” continues Haddad. “It was clear that we both had a deep love and appreciation for music, and that we were committed to pushing the boundaries of what was possible in our respective traditions.” This is something both musicians kept coming back to in the interview: respect. Haddad repeatedly outlined his awe at Angelides’ “ability to blend electronic and acoustic elements in a way that feels both organic and cutting edge”, while Angelides could not overstate his appreciation for the way Haddad embodied “a sonic blend of western meets Middle Eastern”. The two men told me that they’re already talking about working together after this project. You can hear the evidence of this bond in the music. As unlikely as it may seem, the fusion of electronic and orchestral gels effortlessly with the fusion of Arabic and western. “When incorporating elements from Arabic music into a western soundscape, it’s essential to be mindful of the specific musical idioms and techniques that are characteristic of that tradition,” says Haddad. “For example, the use of trills, microtones, glissandos, and so on, can add a distinctly Arabic flavour to a melody, but these elements need to be carefully integrated into the harmony and overall texture of the piece to avoid sounding out of place, or forced. “At the same time, it’s also important to be mindful of the intended audience and musical context. If the composition is for a big-budget gaming project with a primarily western audience, it may be necessary to adapt the Arabic musical elements in a way that feels familiar and accessible to that audience. This could involve using more familiar western harmonic structures or incorporating Arabic elements in a subtle and understated way.” The Assassin’s Creed Mirage soundtrack is powerful. Watching the orchestra work towards the climax of one of the main pieces that was being recorded in the Power Station studio, I saw gooseflesh prick up on the arms of almost everyone in the room. A moment of eye contact between Haddad in the composer’s spot with the orchestra, and Angelides standing to attention in the recording studio, suggested that they’d nailed it with this take. Assassin’s Creed Mirage will launch on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2023."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/21/anger-is-most-powerful-emotion-by-far-for-spurring-climate-action-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-21T15:08:46Z","webTitle":"Anger is most powerful emotion by far for spurring climate action, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/21/anger-is-most-powerful-emotion-by-far-for-spurring-climate-action-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/21/anger-is-most-powerful-emotion-by-far-for-spurring-climate-action-study-finds","fields":{"bodyText":"Anger is by far the most powerful emotional predictor of whether somebody plans to take part in a climate protest, research suggests. The study, which asked 2,000 Norwegian adults how they felt about the climate crisis, found the link to activism was seven times stronger for anger than it was for hope. The effects were smaller for other actions, but fear and guilt were the best predictors of policy support, while sadness, fear and hope were the best predictors of behavioural change. On average, people reported having fairly mild feelings about the planet heating. “The problem isn’t that people feel too scared about climate change,” said Thea Gregersen, a climate psychologist at the Norwegian Research Centre and lead author of the study. “The problem, in Norway at least, seems to be that they’re not scared enough.” Faced with rising reports of ecological anxiety, psychologists across the world are racing to understand how people’s feelings about the destruction of nature affect their mental health and behaviour. But the few studies to interrogate the link between emotions and actions have shown mixed results. “We’re nowhere near having a comprehensive understanding,” said Caroline Hickman, a climate psychologist at the University of Bath, who was not involved in the study. “If anybody presents this material confidently as certainties or pretends they’re an expert, ignore them. Run away.” The researchers in Norway, a rich oil-exporting country, found that for every two steps a person took along the anger scale, they moved one step along the activism scale. The link between emotion and action was weaker for questions about limiting emissions in everyday life and supporting a tax on petrol and diesel. The methods were sound and typical for the field but the effect sizes were small, said Cameron Brick, a social scientist at the University of Amsterdam who was not involved in the study. The researchers also only looked at what people said they would do, rather than what they did, he added. Previous studies have shown “intentions are surprisingly weakly aligned with actual behaviour”. Climate scientists have raised fears that a glut of doom-laden headlines and negative rhetoric – some of it based on incorrect claims – will push people into despair and stop them from acting. A survey of 10,000 young people in 2021 found most agreed with the statement “humanity is doomed”, even though the planet will stop heating in a matter of years if people were to stop clogging the atmosphere with carbon. But experts suggest the gloom reflects a lack of faith in society, rather than a misunderstanding of the physics. “Rather than climate anxiety, we should be calling it politician anxiety or people anxiety, because it’s the people in power who are failing to do the right thing whilst lying to us, or doing the opposite, that is causing the terror,” said Hickman, who was the lead author of the 2021 study and previously a social worker. “I realised eight years ago … that the narratives I was hearing around climate change were the same as the narratives I’d heard around child abuse. The very people who are supposed to protect you are the people who are hurting you. And not only are they hurting you, they’re telling you that they love you and they’re doing it for your own good.” When the researchers in Norway asked participants what made them angry, they found most people mentioned human actions such as causing the climate crisis or failing to stop it. A further 26% said their anger related to human qualities such as people not caring. People should feel angry because they had been deliberately deceived by fossil fuel companies and governments had let that happen, said Dr Laura Thomas-Walters, a social scientist at the Yale Programme on Climate Communication and an activist with Extinction Rebellion, who was not involved in the studies. The link from anger to activism was logical, she added. “It’s in the name that activism is an ‘active’ behaviour, and anger can spur action.” But messages that make people angry can also push others to shut down, particularly if they feel powerless. There were robust studies from health psychology that showed communicating risks could backfire if people were not also told how they could protect themselves, said Lorraine Whitmarsh, the head of the UK’s Centre for Climate Change and Social Transformations, who was not involved in the study. “People really need to feel they can make a difference on climate change. And it’s much harder to make a difference on climate change than it is on health risks, because it’s a great big global collective problem.” Scientists are working to understand the role that hope plays. A review study published on Tuesday found “partial yet inconclusive evidence” that increasing hope makes people engage more with the climate. It found people whose hope was rooted in complacency were less likely to engage than those whose hope was linked to action. “Even there, the relationship seems to be more the other way around,” said Lea Dohm, a psychologist and co-founder of the German climate action group Psychologists for Future, who also was not involved. “It may be less that hope comes first and then brings action, but rather that people act and then hope arises.” What people needed from the media, she said, was above all an honest portrayal of the facts. “When we state scientific facts, some feelings will come. And what we need to do then is validate them and say, hey, what you feel is justified, reasonable and shared by many other people.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T08:26:58Z","webTitle":"Erdoğan’s Turkish election plans disrupted after being taken ill on live TV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/27/recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkish-election-plans-disrupted-after-being-taken-ill-on-live-tv","fields":{"bodyText":"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has had to abruptly cancel election campaign events after being taken ill on live television during an interview. Cameras abruptly cut away from Erdoğan to one of his interviewers, Hasan Öztürk, who looked perturbed and began to rise from his chair before the broadcast cut entirely. In footage distributed by the president’s Justice and Development party (AKP), shot in the same location, Erdoğan explains that he contracted stomach flu following intense work on the campaign trail weeks before the pivotal election. He later tweeted: “Today I will rest at home upon the advice of my doctors … with God’s permission, we will continue our campaign from tomorrow onwards.” The vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said he would attend campaign events across central Turkey in his place. Turkey is holding parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May, when Erdoğan faces a concerted challenge from a six-party opposition striving to unseat him after 20 years in power. Many polls give his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a slight lead, amid discontent with an ongoing economic crisis and the government’s response to deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, and 8,000 in Syria. Erdoğan cancelled personal appearances at a number of high-profile campaign events due to his sudden illness, including attending the opening ceremony of part of a Russian-funded nuclear power plant in southern Turkey and a nearby rally. The nuclear plant is the latest flagship infrastructure project that Erdoğan and the AKP are hoping will sway voters at the upcoming election, despite concerns about the relationship between government-led construction projects and collapsed infrastructure following the earthquake. The AKP deputy chair, Erkan Kandemir, said Erdoğan would attend the ceremony at the nuclear power plant via video link. “Our president will attend the Akkuyu nuclear power plant ceremony, which is planned to be held tomorrow, online.

That scepticism has been more than justified by the utter failure of the NPT review conference to agree even a weak final document, with fine words about their “unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals” but no commitment to physical steps towards that end. The primary blame has been laid on Russia, but it is shared by all of the nuclear-armed states. Russia was not alone in derailing this conference. It was fully aligned with the other NPT countries in actively preventing any meaningful commitment to advance nuclear disarmament, stop nuclear threats, or reduce nuclear risks from being included in the outcome document. For decades, those of us in the peace movement have pinned our hopes of averting Armageddon on article VI being implemented in “good faith”, but the latest setback is forcing a rethink. Should we abandon the NPT and go for direct action? Perhaps the only way to break the deadlock is for one of the major nuclear-armed powers to break ranks by declaring that nuclear weapons do not give security, but, on the contrary, their continued existence threatens all of us. Does anyone really believe that the immediate response from another nuclear weapon state would be: “Oh, good, now we can chuck a nuke at X with impunity; let’s do it”? The first global leader who makes that declaration, really means it, and implements the necessary practical steps, will go down in history as the greatest statesperson of all time. Who will rise to that challenge? Frank Jackson Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign • New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was correct to call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but made no mention of closing off the route to more nations obtaining such weapons, which will require the elimination of nuclear power too. The Ukraine war has shown how close we might be to the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe, but has also made clear the danger inherent in ownership of nuclear power plants. The possibility of widespread radioactive pollution induced by the destruction of nuclear power stations during a war or act of terrorism was once seen as fanciful. However, events in Ukraine have shown that it is not (Revealed: Russian plan to disconnect Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from grid, 24 August). To tackle both these nuclear dangers requires two steps. Step one involves the reduction, then eventual elimination, of nuclear weapons, in a way that gives nuclear nations the confidence to do so. Jonathan Schell, in his book The Abolition, explained how to achieve this by what he termed “weaponless deterrence”. He proposed allowing nuclear states to keep the infrastructure to remake nuclear weapons should there be any verified threat of a new nation obtaining them. This approach will underpin global pressure to halt any aspiring nuclear nation, since such weapons are in the process of being negotiated away. The second step will be a parallel programme to eliminate nuclear power, since this is the likely source of such a spread.

Its portrayal of the first atomic bomb detonation, for example, lacked the “violet hues” and heat wave of the real thing. “Some characters even made comments like ‘quantum mechanics is hard’, which I disagree with – it’s only hard if someone hasn’t explained it properly,” says Dr Kirrily Rule, an instrument scientist who works with the thermal triple-axis spectrometer Taipan at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto). Rule gives Christopher Nolan’s movie about the Manhattan project four stars, saying it’s exciting and suspenseful but the science is “brushed over”. “As a physicist watching the movie, I think they could have been much clearer on the science involved … I believe Nolan used such high-level jargon as a confusing element to the film intentionally. “It made the audience feel separated from these scientific giants. As a scientist and teacher, I think this is a poor way to represent science – it just continues to give people the impression that ‘science is too hard’.” The Irish actor Cillian Murphy plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos laboratory, which produced the bomb. It portrays his pride, his remorse and his downfall. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Dr Ceri Brenner (four stars), leader of Ansto’s Centre for Accelerator Science, says the one thing missing for her is an element of the 1945 detonation in New Mexico, which was codenamed Trinity. “[When] the device went off, we got the flash of light and the silence, but I didn’t notice anyone reacting to the immediate experience of heat that accompanied the visual of the flash,” she says. “The energy emitted from fission is radiative and carried long distances via electromagnetic radiation, which travels at the speed of light, compared to conductive or convective heat that propagates more like the sound wave boom that arrived shortly after. “I saw a documentary where someone described it as being similar to opening an oven door and feeling the immediate bath of heat emerging.” Dr Mark Ho (four stars), a nuclear analyst, says he would have liked to have seen the atomic explosion “more faithfully portrayed in violet hues”. Major General Thomas Farrell, deputy to Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon in the film), has described the detonation as “birth of a new age – the age of atomic energy”. “The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun,” he said, according to the Conversation. “It was golden, violet, grey and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined.” Dr Helen Maynard-Casely (five stars), an instrument scientist working with Ansto’s high-intensity powder diffractometer, Wombat, says the development of the first nuclear reactor is comparable to the space race between Russia and the US. The project’s lasting legacy for morality, global politics and technology is undeniable, she says, but: “It would be nice to imagine a world where the first thought on splitting a uranium atom would have been, ‘Ooo this would be good for energy,’ rather than, ‘This could make a bomb.’” Dr Joseph Bevitt (four stars), an instrument scientist on Ansto’s radiograph, tomography and imaging station Dingo, says he wanted more of the “epic and intense” movie. “At the end of the three hours, I asked, ‘Is that it?’ I craved more,” he says. “The significance of the Chicago pile reactor, built under stadium seating, was glossed over. The first criticality of the X-10 reactor at Oak Ridge National Lab, the contributions of Enrico Fermi, and so much more, were omitted. “The ramifications of the atomic bombings for humanity were suggested, but I needed closure. “The formation of the ‘Atoms for Peace’ program, the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the positive real-life impacts that atomic research and neutron science have on everyday health and technological advancement followed those events.” The so-called “Barbenheimer effect” smashed Australian box office records at the weekend, with Oppenheimer making $9.36m, the fourth-highest opening weekend for a 2023 film.

He looks a little haggard these days, like a homeless wizard: the face worn and weathered, a thick Arctic forest of a beard hanging from him. Deep breaths. Voice cracked and familiar. Baseball cap drawn low over sad eyes. On the walls at Liverpool’s training ground there are photos from his arrival, a younger and handsomer man staring him down every day he comes into work. Seven years. How has it only been seven years? How has it already been seven years? Somebody asks a question about Liverpool’s slow starts. Something about mentality. Suddenly he recognises a face, a name, some words, a feeling. A brief and powerful memory flickers and ignites inside him. “It’s really difficult to talk to you, if I’m 100% honest,” Klopp snapped at James Pearce, a Liverpool reporter from the Athletic, on Saturday night. “You know why. For all the things you wrote.” Of course Klopp’s outburst seems to have provoked all the usual trimmings of shock and outrage from all the usual places. Personally, I’m surprised this kind of thing doesn’t happen more often. Particularly when you consider the rawness of the emotions involved, the artificiality of the setting, the staggering gulf in expertise between those doing the asking and those doing the answering. Just pause for a second to consider how much more Klopp must know about his job than the average attendee at one of his press conferences. This is no slight on the football press, by the way: these are by definition quite different jobs with different functions, different target audiences, almost a different language. This largely explains why so many football press conferences produce so little of genuine intellectual value: the common ground between the interlocutors is so narrow as to be essentially meaningless. In which other profession are its ablest and brightest practitioners contractually obliged to take questions from the patently unqualified on an almost daily basis? Prof Andrew Wiles: congratulations on the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, do you think you’ve really laid down a marker there to the mathematical field? Big Fields medal announcement on Wednesday night, how important is it to get your hands on that first trophy of the year? Any knocks? Yet for all its inefficiency there remains a strange ritualistic power to the press conference, into which all its participants willingly buy. There are coaches for whom the press conference dais may as well be their pulpit: a piece of performance theatre as intrinsic to their brand as anything they do on a training pitch. There are journalists whose entire job revolves around press conferences: driving to them, waiting around for them to start, driving home from them. The little huddle after the press conference where everyone discusses what the best line was, who gets to use what when, and who transcribes which bits. Dave, I’ll do the first five minutes. Sparky, can I keep my answer back until Monday? Yeah, the one about “any special plans for James Maddison”. Yeah. Magic. If you’re on the inside of this world, there’s something luxuriously seductive to it, even as 24-hour news and social media nibble away at it from the outside. The game is gigantic and the show is global. But here in this windowless room on a cardboard campus in the middle of nowhere, there is a small piece of it that will forever be yours, some mid-strength embargoed Eddie Howe quotes burning a hole in your Olympus voice recorder. Of course, everyone has a chastening story or two. José Mourinho once blasted me on live television after a pointed question about Alexis Sánchez. Roy Keane rounded on me after I asked whether his turgid Ipswich side needed to lower their ambitions for the season. These are brief and fleeting moments when the fourth wall is broken, when the forced conviviality of this entire absurd encounter comes crashing down in flames. Because in essence the whole encounter is a kind of pantomime, a marketplace, a verbal arm-wrestle in which the protagonists have largely conflicting goals. The coach has a particular message they want to convey. They may have a score to settle. They may be intent on saying as little as possible. But they always have one big power differential over the rest of the room: while everyone is obliged to know who they are, they are not remotely obliged to know any of the faces in front of them. This is the compact Klopp broke so savagely on Saturday night. I don’t know Pearce, and I don’t know why Klopp has chosen to beef with one of the most loyal pro-Liverpool reporters in the business. But while coaches must occasionally read their own press – what is the point in having an ego that big unless you can stroke it every so often? – the pretence of oblivion must be maintained at all times. Klopp’s Liverpool were always based on control. Control of the ball and control of the transition, control of the science and control of the message. Yet among all his other problems, Klopp has lost a lot of expertise in recent months, trusted colleagues and sounding boards: sporting director Michael Edwards, president Mike Gordon, director of research Ian Graham.

It said two Ukrainian drones were shot down near the city of Sevastopol on the Crimean coast, and “another 9 were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed in the Black Sea”. The ministry said there were no reports of damage or casualties in any of the affected areas. Ukraine claims to have shot down seven of ten “Shahed” drones launched at it overnight by Russia. Air defence was said to be active in Kyiv region and Khmelnytskyi. Ukraine’s navy has said a new temporary Black Sea “humanitarian corridor” had started working on Thursday and that the first ships were expected to use it within days. Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian navy, said the corridor would be used by commercial ships blocked at Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and for grain and agricultural products. “The corridor will be very transparent, we will put cameras on the ships and there will be a broadcast to show that this is purely a humanitarian mission and has no military purpose,” he said. The navy said in a separate statement that the risk posed by mines in the Black Sea and the military threat from Russia remained. Three people are now known to have died after a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia late on Wednesday. Two young women and a man were killed and nine other people were wounded, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. A video posted by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy overnight showed smoke billowing from burning and badly damaged buildings next to a church. Zaporizhzhia city council secretary Anatoliy Kurtev said the church had been destroyed and about 15 high-rise buildings had been damaged. The authorities received requests from residents of at least 400 apartments to repair smashed windows and damaged balconies. Six residents of Bilozerka in the Kherson region have been hopitalised after Russian artilerry fire hit people receiving humanitarian aid, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. One person was killed and two were wounded in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian village of Chausy in the Bryansk region, the region’s governor claimed on Thursday. Russian drones destroyed a fuel depot in Ukraine’s western Rivne region on Thursday, governor Vitaly Koval wrote on the Telegram messaging app. There were no casualties from the attack, he said, standing in front of the burning site in a video. Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant again lost connection to its last remaining main external power line overnight and was switched to a reserve line, state-owned power generating company Energoatom said on Thursday. Energoatom said that Europe’s largest nuclear power plant was on the verge of a blackout as the reserve line had less than half of the power capacity of the main power line. Additionally, the station’s Russian-installed administration said the Number 4 reactor had been moved from a “hot” to a “cold” shutdown because of signs of a steam leak. Zaporizhizhia nuclear power plant with its six reactors has been controlled by the Russian military since the early days of Moscow’s invasion in February 2022. Both sides have repeatedly accused the other of endangering the safety of the plant. The co-founder of Russian internet giant Yandex, Arkady Volozh, on Thursday condemned what he described as Russia’s “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine, days after criticism in Russia over his apparent efforts to distance himself from the country. Volozh described himself as a “Kazakhstan-born Israeli tech entrepreneur” on a personal website, drawing some criticism in Russian media and on the Telegram messenging platform for apparently playing down his links to Russia. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is barbaric, and I am categorically against it,” Reuters reports Volozh said in a statement. “I am horrified about the fate of people in Ukraine – many of them my personal friends and relatives – whose houses are being bombed every day.” Poland is planning to move up to 10,000 additional troops to the border with Belarus to support the Border Guard, the defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said on Thursday. “About 10,000 soldiers will be on the border, of which 4,000 will directly support the Border Guard and 6,000 will be in the reserve,” the minister said in an interview for public radio. “We move the army closer to the border with Belarus to scare away the aggressor so that it does not dare to attack us,” Błaszczak said. Last week Poland said Belarusian helicopters had violated its airspace and has warned of provocations. The UK Ministry of Defence has claimed Russian authorities have stepped up efforts to block citizens’ access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which allow people to bypass restrictions on the internet. It notes “VPNs are hugely popular in Russia, despite being illegal since 2017. They allow users to access objective international news sources, including about the war in Ukraine.” On Wednesday an explosion on the grounds of a factory north of Moscow that previously made optical equipment for the Russian military killed one person, wounded 60 others and left at least eight people unaccounted for, officials said. No official explanation was given for the explosion in the city of Sergiev Posad, which produced a tall plume of black smoke and added to jitters over recent night-time drone attacks on Moscow. Ukrainian forces have made an attempt to cross the Dnipro river dividing liberated and occupied Kherson, potentially breaching what has for months served as the frontline in the south of Ukraine. Russian military bloggers reported that up to seven boats, each carrying around six to seven people, landed near the settlement of Kozachi Laheri, east of Kherson city, and broke through Russian defensive lines. The US and Canada imposed new sanctions this week on Belarus over its human rights abuses and support for the war in Ukraine. The new US measures include action against the state carrier Belavia and target a tobacco mogul close to president Alexander Lukashenko as well as 101 officials accused of subverting democracy. Moscow accused Poland and Finland of threatening its security on Wednesday and vowed a response to multiplying “threats” on Russia’s western frontier from Nato members. “Threats to the military security of the Russian Federation have multiplied in the western and northwestern strategic directions,” defence minister Sergei Shoigu said at a meeting with military officials. Those risks “require a timely and adequate response,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-19T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"‘She doesn’t have the power’: Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper on why racist ‘incident’ won’t define him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism","fields":{"bodyText":"It is 7.57am on a Monday morning. I see Christian Cooper sitting with perfect posture on a bench right at the entrance of Central Park at West 103rd street. His first question for me is: have I brought any binoculars? I don’t own a pair, I admit. No worries, he says. If we spot anything, he’ll lend me his. That’s the most important birding tip I learned from his new book: you spot movement in the sky, with your naked eye first, then you raise your binoculars, not the other way around. Cooper is joyous when he tells me this. “If the book does nothing else but teach people how to use binoculars so they can actually see the birds, mission accomplished,” he says. The book, Better Living Through Birding, is Cooper’s first memoir. It traces his journey from his childhood as a nerdy kid from Long Island, to his time as a comic book editor, to his birding days in Central Park. While doing so it weaves the history of Black people in America – from slavery and lynchings to segregation and economic disparity – into the unfolding of his life. It also covers the moment, three years ago, when Cooper received international attention when, while birdwatching in Central Park, he asked a woman to leash her dog, in compliance with park rules, because he didn’t want it to disturb or maim any nearby birds. The woman, Amy Cooper (a stranger to Christian, their shared surname a coincidence), who is white, became irate and said that she would call the cops and tell them that an African American man was threatening her life. Christian Cooper was doing no such thing, but he did film the entire exchange. He posted the video to his Facebook friends with the context of what happened. His sister Melody asked if she could share it on Twitter. Cooper hesitated but ultimately obliged. Kathy Griffin retweeted it and the rest, as they say, is history. The 69-second video got more than 45m views. Cooper now references this whole ordeal as “the incident”. In that instant, a white woman made a false accusation that could have led to his death. She knew the stakes, which is why she feigned hysteria on the phone with the cops. Christian Cooper knew the stakes, too. But though Amy Cooper swiftly lost her job after the video went viral, Christian Cooper did not want any part of the prosecutorial process, a decision that put him at odds with some Black people, including his relatives. He tells me: “There were a lot of factors involved. It was potentially very important to set a precedent where someone was held accountable, legally, for making a false accusation against a Black person.” He stresses that it was a tough call not to get involved, but unless the district attorney were to subpoena him, he was going to choose mercy. Not everyone was a fan of his choice. One of his relatives revealed the reason for their ire: “They had a brother who was in an affair with a white woman and when she got found out, she said it was rape. That person spent years in a jail in the south for that reason. So false accusations have haunted us for a long time,” Cooper says. I admit to him that, at the time, I was one of those people who was shocked that he didn’t want to be contributing more to her downfall. Punishment along with further punishment is part of what structures – and upholds – our society; we live in a punitive culture and the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It would be normal for Cooper to want retribution, but he doesn’t see it that way. “We [African-Americans] are fighting to have some sense of proportionality in how we are treated in the criminal justice system. So how can I turn that around and not consider the same thing?” he says. Cooper thought that the woman had already received enough punishment without further piling on necessary. “Her life had imploded. It’s not like I had been handcuffed or thrown to the ground or God forbid anything more deadly or serious,” he says. “If you could look at what happened to her and not conclude that you shouldn’t make false accusations, then how is any legal proceeding going to change your mind?” Furthermore, he says, he is not traumatized. People will approach him and say how sorry they are about his trauma. “What trauma?” Cooper says. “She just does not have that much power. Maybe it’s a consequence of being Black our whole lives.” In this country, Blackness is inextricably linked to suffering. A racist incident can often be the summary, rather than a chapter, of how our entire lives are esteemed, and this is what Cooper resists. We approach a spot where, about five or six years ago, Cooper spotted a Lincoln’s sparrow; he calls these “the fine wines of birding” because they are so hard to find. “It’s like someone took pen and watercolor and drew a sparrow because it’s so finely marked,” he says. This is what Cooper thinks about when he enters the park. He was neither traumatized nor shellshocked after “the incident”. He tells me: “When I go back to the park and I am at that spot where that mess happened, I’m not thinking about that. I’m remembering that time when there was a mourning warbler on that chip path 15 years ago and I remember the scarlet tanagers last week. That’s what I think about when I’m in the park.” Today, for example, he’s more excited about whether or not we’ll get to see an Acadian or great crested flycatcher. He’s concerned we might not get lucky because spring migration has already passed and fall migration is still months away. This is a man who routinely wakes up at 4am and ventures into Central Park at 5.30. He lets me know early on that his life and passions are more than “the incident”. As we start walking we spot a red-winged blackbird. It’s a very significant bird in Cooper’s life, he calls it his “spark bird”, a term used to describe the type of bird that first converts a person to birdwatching. Cooper references the bird at the beginning of the book and it sets the tone for a multilayered and intricate exploration of his own identity. In his book, Cooper describes the red-winged blackbird as a trickster of sorts. In the Americas, it’s part of a family of birds called icterids. When English settlers came to the western hemisphere, they thought it to be the same as the birds they saw in the UK, thus giving it the same name. But the joke was on them because the Eurasian blackbird is not an icterid, it’s part of the genus thrush. To add even more complexity, the UK already has a bird called the redwing, which belongs to the thrush family as well. Are you confused yet? Cooper writes in his book that these complicated taxonomies, through which humans label birds, first resonated with him when he was young, as a Black, queer, closeted kid growing up in a conservative Long Island community in the 60s and 70s. Though Cooper knew he was queer from the moment that his five-year-old self saw a male superhero in a comic book, he wasn’t open about his sexuality until he began studying at Harvard, where he took part in the ornithological club and the gay students association. His love of comics landed him a job as an assistant editor at Marvel in the early 90s. When he talks about this period of his life, I’m astonished by how certain he was in his identity at that time. He tells me that one day Paul Becton, a Black colorist for Marvel, walked into his office and saw a picture of the former Yankees player Steve Sax on the wall. “He was like, ‘Yes! Are you a Yankees fan?’ I’m like, ‘No.’ He’s like, ‘Are you just some homosexual with a thing for Steve Sax?’ ‘Yes,’” Cooper says. Cooper was only in his late 20s then, at a time when the world of comic book publishing was even more blindingly white than it is today. But he never tried to hide who he was: “I didn’t give them a choice. I’m queer. I’m OK with it. You can either be OK with it or not. That’s on you.” Cooper’s love of nature initially came from his father, Francis, a Korean war veteran, science teacher and civil rights activist. Francis took Cooper on trips to Yellowstone, Maine, the prairie provinces of Canada and the Olympic peninsula, trips that Cooper found it hard to return to in his writing. “At one point, my editors had to wait a whole month before they got any more pages out of me because I came to the part in telling the story of my family where everybody starts to die. I was like, ‘I cannot write this.’ I didn’t know how to deal with this. I’m not a very confessional person. And I’m not a very emotional person.” In his memoir, he writes that his father was a man who often projected his anger and frustrations on to his family, which made Cooper, his mother and his sister feel as though they were walking on eggshells around him for many years. The binoculars that hang around Cooper’s neck are the pair his father gifted to him on his 50th birthday. Even if it might have been hard for Cooper to write about and memorialize his father, his father was with us on our walk. Activism is also in Cooper’s blood. There is a photo of him as an infant in a stroller during a protest. Whether it was fighting school segregation or spearheading a Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Cooper’s parents phoned, marched, organized and did whatever else they could to get into “good trouble”, a phrase most popularly attributed to John Lewis and his activism efforts. Cooper was arrested twice in 1999 within a matter of weeks while he was protesting for justice over the murder of Amadou Diallo. After a gay couple was bashed in upper Manhattan, he along with his allies at Glaad, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, organized an anti-violence rally. Black people and birds are connected particularly because of our shared history with migration, Cooper says: “Birds and African American history – they weave together in surprising ways. My family left Alabama because there was all this opportunity – the great migration. That’s exactly why birds migrate. Birds leave the south to come to the north because of opportunities seasonally.” He gets enthusiastic when I mention that even before this turning point in US history, Harriet Tubman learned bird calls in order to signal to other freedom seekers when it was safe or unsafe to proceed. He loves this part of her story. The silver lining of “the incident” is that Cooper has met many other Black people who’ve gotten interested in birding, which delights him to no end. Months after the incident happened, he did a PBS special in which he talked about the “joys and challenges of birding while Black” and was featured in the Washington Post about his desire to diversify the activity. Birds have always meant liberation to Cooper. Alongside his memoir, he has a forthcoming National Geographic wildlife show in which he will examine birds across the US, including in his family’s ancestral land of Alabama. He hopes that readers and viewers alike can understand this symbolism. In his own words, as the birds sing above us, “Every place has atmosphere, every place has sky, and they just spread their wings and they can go anywhere. You know, the whole time we’ve been walking and talking, we can walk forward, we can walk back. We can walk left, we can walk right, but we can’t really go up or down very much unless, you know, we’re walking up a hill or down a hill. They just think it and they can go up or down under their own power. That freedom, that ability to think in three dimensions. All of that just makes birds incredibly inspiring.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T14:00:26Z","webTitle":"Why is the UK government backing nuclear power when onshore wind is so much better? | Alethea Warrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/government-nuclear-power-onshore-wind-better","fields":{"bodyText":"After Friday’s huge jump in energy costs, millions of people across the UK face a frightening future. Urgent measures are needed but, instead of taking action, the cabinet is absorbed in a pointless argument that wrongly pits the energy bill crisis against our climate commitments. In reality, the best way of bringing down bills is to get off gas for good. We can take immediate steps to stop using gas because the UK has clean energy sources that can get going quickly, and are cheap and popular – wind and solar in particular. But at a time when they should be powering up the UK with renewables, ministers have other ideas: suggesting deepening our reliance on fossils fuels by opening up more drilling in the UK; or labouring under the misapprehension that people would rather live near a nuclear power plant than a wind turbine. The government’s tug of war over onshore wind is particularly puzzling. Onshore wind is clean, cheap and extremely popular, with the government’s own polling showing support from four out of five people in the UK. Far from considering them an “eyesore” as some Tory MPs and ministers worry, a Survation poll last year found that people who live near existing windfarms are the most supportive of all. Yet a major cause of the past month’s delay in getting the energy strategy out appears to be the government’s utterly unfounded concern that people don’t like onshore wind, and their mistaken belief that removing the virtual ban on new wind projects in England would provoke huge resistance from Conservative voters. The government removed support for onshore wind in 2015 following pressure from a group of Conservative MPs, some of whom have since changed their minds, left parliament or moved on to other pet peeves. The dislike for visible renewable energy projects from a fraction of the Conservative backbenches has always been out of step with public opinion, which has been consistently behind renewable energy, including onshore wind. Even a decade ago, two-thirds of people supported onshore wind, with support steadily rising to the 80% at which it currently stands. The British public know that clean energy is the way out of this crisis but, as they watch their energy bills shoot up and face the dismal prospect of cold homes, all they can see is their government dithering and delaying on the clean energy sources that are the quickest and easiest solution. Instead of fixing this crisis with renewable energy, ministers are reportedly thinking of pursuing nuclear power. Ministers recently tried and failed to argue that onshore wind is too expensive, yet they seem quite happy to argue for bill payers to shoulder the cost of nuclear power, which is about twice as high per unit of electricity as onshore wind. Given the urgency with which we need to clean up our energy supply and cut energy bills, the sluggish timeframes for new nuclear power projects risk leaving people at the mercy of gas markets for far too long. Wind projects commissioned now can be up and running before the end of next year, while the most recent nuclear projects, announced in 2010, won’t produce any energy until 2026 at the earliest. It is hardly surprising that nuclear power is much less popular than onshore wind, with just a third of people thinking that nuclear power would be affordable and even fewer thinking it is safe. If the government believes that new nuclear plants will be an easier sell to people than onshore wind on cost or local impacts, they could be in for an unpleasant shock. Ministers who insist that the UK’s energy strategy must prioritise community consent are right. Now they must also recognise that any plan to rush forward with an unpopular, slow and expensive energy source, while keeping the brakes on clean, cheap and quick onshore wind, is unlikely to gain support. It is time for the government to start listening to what people actually want, which is appropriately placed renewable energy projects that support local people and the local environment and for communities to have a say on the infrastructure in their area. The energy strategy is a vital chance to make this a reality. If the government gets this wrong, we’ll be living in cold homes on a hot planet. If they get it right, this could be the last energy crisis we ever have.

But missing from the Hertfordshire town’s dedication to its famous residents is anyone by the name of “Stevenage Woman”. However, a Labour thinktank believes that if the party heeds its advice, this mythical archetype – along with 2019’s “Workington Man”, who Labour is trying to win back from the Tories - is the key to regaining power in the next general election. According to Labour Together, this newly identified group of voters – also referred to as “disillusioned suburbans” in its report, Red Shift – is a full-time working mother of two in her early 40s. The group is not in poverty but battling stagnant wages and cost increases, the report, published today, says. Disengaged from daily politics, but “by nature a balancer”, the group leans towards social conservatism, is “a little to the left” on the economy and is “comfortable” with immigration, the report adds. In the last election, Stevenage Woman voted Conservative, but is now twice as likely to back Labour, the report predicts. “She’s not seeking radical or dramatic change, but she is worried about her life today, the state of public services, and life in her town.” The theory is that if Labour can win over this demographic group it could transform the electoral map. Stevenage is a bellwether constituency (it has backed the winner every time since its creation in 1983) . But what do its women think of this characterisation? “She’s the Stevenage woman!” said Helen O’Sullivan, 65, pointing to the fabric and haberdashery owner Pamela Waterman, 64, surrounded by rolls of fabric and boxes of buttons at Buttons and Bows in Stevenage Indoor Market. As a small business owner approaching pension age who describes her life as “pretty good”, in many ways Waterman diverges from the new voter archetype, but she said it might be accurate in others. “I probably didn’t vote in the last election to be truthful,” she said. “And I can see younger people being disinterested in politics per se. But I also think there’s a lot of positives here.” She does not usually follow politics, other than the issues that affect her business and family, but she will vote in the next election. “We’re in a huge mess at the moment. The country needs some direction.” But she hasn’t yet decided between Labour and Conservative, or made her mind up on Keir Starmer – although she does recall him visiting the market in 2020. Britain, she said, had become the “laughing stock of Europe and beyond” after the leadership of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. “Collectively we should be able to pull together and with some good leadership get back to some of what we had.” O’Sullivan, who is retired, plans to vote Labour as always. Iza Stuchlik, 40, a bakery owner, said the description of Stevenage Woman was inaccurate, offensive and patronising, with many women in the town earning higher salaries in London. “Stevenage is very varied. You can’t say ‘this is the type of woman that lives here’. That’s very unfair.” But when it comes to politics, she is apathetic. “I don’t feel I have the power,” she said. Report co-author Josh Simons, director of Labour Together, said the term Stevenage Woman was not intended to represent everyone in the town, but to “focus political attention on towns like Stevenage, which for too long have not got a proper hearing”. Tanjira Busbui, 45, a nail technician, had not heard of Starmer or the Labour party, but her colleague Kanya Buathong, 45, said he had a better reputation than Boris Johnson or the former health secretary Matt Hancock. “He [Starmer] came in here a couple of years ago in the market and he was quite nice.” Would she vote for him? “Yes.” Somewhat unfortunately, perhaps, the person Labour has charged with winning Stevenage, which has a population of about 90,000, is in fact a man. Conservative Stephen McPartland has held the seat since 2010 but has announced he will not stand again. Labour’s Kevin Bonavia, 45, moved to the town last year from south-east London, where he was previously a Lewisham councillor. But sitting in Stevenage town square, overlooked by a constructivist-style Grade II-listed clocktower, Karen Parker, 39, who is unemployed and a lifelong Conservative voter, said there was nothing Labour could say to win her vote. By her side, Hannah Ayles, also 39, would like to see a Johnson comeback. “He said it how it was.” More help was needed, she added, especially for those on benefits. “I’m signed off and trying to get from pay day to pay day. It doesn’t work.” Esther Ah Chin Kow, 72, a retired nurse, said she liked the town, but was worried about crime and said elderly people were afraid to go out at night. While Starmer lacked name recognition with many women the Observer spoke to, the sense of disillusionment referred to in the Labour Together report was rife. “I don’t really follow politics,” said Patience Marty, a clinical support worker who has lived in the town for 15 years. “I just buy my daily bread, go to work, go home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
