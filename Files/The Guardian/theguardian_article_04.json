The war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan will dominate G7 discussions this week, but the host, Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, is expected to carve out time to push for a pledge on nuclear weapons when leaders meet in Hiroshima, the first place on Earth targeted by an atomic bomb. The leaders began to arrive on Thursday, before an expected visit on Saturday to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, which contains exhibits showing the scale of the tragedy that unfolded after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people by the end of the year. Kishida, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other G7 leaders are expected to see displays including a simulation that reproduces the wave of destruction that followed the bombing, with the human cost represented by mundane items such as ripped school uniforms, the blackened contents of a bento lunchbox, and a tricycle whose three-year-old owner would die within 24 hours. The need to reference the dangers of nuclear weapons has intensified since Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima in 2016. Vladimir Putin has refused to publicly rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, while North Korea continues to develop more sophisticated missiles theoretically capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US mainland. What has Kishida said in the run-up to the summit? He spoke of his desire for “a world without nuclear weapons”, although campaigners point to the failure by Japan – part of the US nuclear umbrella – to sign a 2021 UN treaty banning the possession and use of nuclear weapons. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said of the planned group visit to the peace museum. Biden ‘confident’ of reaching deal with McCarthy to avoid US debt default Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said yesterday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach. Speaking at the White House, Biden said: “I’m confident that we’ll get the agreement on the budget, that America will not default. We’re going to come together because there’s no alternative way to do the right thing for the country. We have to move on.” On Tuesday, Biden and McCarthy met for an hour at the White House, a meeting the president called productive. Biden, who has faced some criticism for his handling of the issue, is due to travel to the G7 summit in Japan but has cut the trip short to pursue a debt ceiling deal. Plans to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia were postponed. A failure to honour US debts could have catastrophic effects on the US and world economies. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has indicated that without agreement default could come as early as 1 June. Republicans want sharp spending cuts. Democrats say Republicans should agree to a “clean” debt bill, the sort they repeatedly passed under Donald Trump. But Biden also seemed ready to make compromises, including some work requirements on federal programs, though not on healthcare. What has Biden said in response to the criticism? The president said: “I’ll be in constant contact with my team while I’m at the G7 and be in close touch with speaker McCarthy and other leaders as well. What I have done in anticipation that we won’t get it all done till I get back is, I’ve cut my trip short in order to be [here] for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader.” What has McCarthy said? Speaking to CNBC, he said: “I think at the end of the day we do not have a debt default. The thing I’m confident about is now we have a structure to find a way to come to a conclusion. The timeline is very tight. But we’re going to make sure we’re in the room and get this done.” Nike may have misclassified workers and could face more than $530m in tax fines Nike may have misclassified thousands of temporary office workers and faces potential tax fines of more than $530m, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The sporting goods company employs more than 79,000 people worldwide and, like many large corporations, relies on an army of independent contractors to do much of the work, including business consulting, T-shirt graphics, photography and event planning. According to independent reports compiled for the company and given to the Guardian, Nike management’s handling of independent contractors has left it open to potentially huge fines from tax authorities and the possibility of class-action lawsuits. The US, UK and other countries have strict rules about the use of independent contractors, meant to protect workers’ rights and ensure fair tax collection. The Biden administration last year indicated it intends to crack down on companies that infringe them. Where does the $530m figure come from? A July 2022 review of Nike’s independent contractors in the US, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the company faces a “misclassification risk” of more than $530m. The report, compiled by People2.0, a workforce services specialist, looked at 3,670 entities – independent contractors, law firms, individuals and others – in the US who had been paid more than $7.2bn over three years. It found that a quarter of those contractors may have been incorrectly classified. What has Nike said? The company did not return calls and emails for comment. In other news … Jack Teixeira, the US air national guard member charged with being behind the Pentagon leaks of highly classified military documents, was warned repeatedly over his mishandling of classified material, according to a court filing. Justice department lawyers made the disclosure in court papers that urged Teixeira be kept behind bars while he awaits trial. Westpac has banned customers from transferring funds to the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, in a move aimed at reducing losses from scams. The Australian big four bank said today it was blocking a number of cryptocurrency exchanges as part of a trial. Republicans successfully sidestepped an effort to force them into a vote to expel George Santos, the New York representative, from Congress, which could have narrowed their already slim four-seat majority. The House voted along party lines, 221-204, to refer a resolution to expel the congressman to the House ethics committee. Montana has became the first US state to ban TikTok after the governor signed legislation prohibiting mobile application stores from offering the app within the state by next year. The move is among the most dramatic in a series of US escalations against TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Stat of the day: top five US executives hoard $9bn tax-free for retirement as workers face limits The top five executives at the US’s largest companies have amassed close to $9bn in tax-free retirement saving accounts while many of their employees have struggled to set aside any funds for retirement, according to a report released today. The report, A Tale of Two Retirements, from the Institute for Policy Studies and Jobs With Justice, found the top five executives at S&amp;P 500 firms held a combined $8.9bn in special tax-deferred accounts at the end of 2021. Income taxes will be due on this compensation when they withdraw the funds, but in the meantime they benefit from the tax-free compounding of investment returns. These “top hat” plans allow unlimited tax-deferred retirement while ordinary workers face strict limits on their 401(k) retirement plan contributions. Don’t miss this: the best childcare in the world? Maybe so, but new parents in Iceland are holding out for better In a bright, bunting-filled community hall in central Reykjavik, 30 parents are attending a council-funded playgroup. Half of them are fathers – not unusual in a country considered to have one of the best childcare policies in the world. As well as six months’ leave for both parents at 80% of pay – with six weeks extra to share between them – childcare is heavily subsidised by the government. Yet parents and policymakers are pushing for more. Iceland spends 1.7% of its gross domestic product on early childhood education and care – more than double that of most other countries. That leaves Icelandic families spending only about 5% of their income on childcare. Despite this, parents at the Thursday playgroup, run by an organisation called Memmm, are pushing for more change. Parents explain why. … or this: the fall of Rudy Giuliani, once the toast of New York, continues unabated From “America’s mayor” to a human punchline, Rudy Giuliani’s descent continues unabated, writes Lloyd Green. On Monday, news broke of the septuagenarian being slammed with a $10m sexual harassment and unpaid wages lawsuit brought by Noelle Dunphy, 43, a former aide. The mighty have fallen. Once Giuliani was the toast of town. As a federal prosecutor he sent a congressman to jail, locked up mobsters and indicted white-collar criminals. As mayor, he made the streets feel safe again. Love him or hate him, crime precipitously dropped on his watch. In the days and months following 9/11, he projected strength, confidence and reassurance. He had braced himself for a calamity; he just didn’t know its source or when it would happen. He was steady when crunch time arrived. These days, Giuliani and the words “defendant” and “buffoon” stand adjacent. Man sues Giuliani over false arrest after ‘pat’ on back led to assault charge Climate check: world likely to breach 1.5C climate threshold by 2027, scientists warn The world is almost certain to experience new record temperatures in the next five years and temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have warned. The breaching of the crucial 1.5C threshold, which scientists have said could have dire consequences, should be only temporary, according to research from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, it would represent a marked acceleration of human impacts on the global climate system and send the world into “uncharted territory”, the UN agency warned. Countries have pledged, under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to try to hold global temperatures to no higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after scientific advice that heating beyond that level would unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts. Last Thing: blues singer gets high school diploma decades after being expelled for his hair The US blues musician Otis Taylor, whose critically revered song Ten Million Slaves has been featured on major films and television shows, has at the age of 74 received his diploma from the high school that expelled him decades ago because of his hairstyle. Taylor was studying at Manual high school in Denver in 1966 when he drew unwanted attention from administrators because of his long hair and was kicked out. Since then, laws have been passed that prohibit discrimination against students over their hairstyle. More recently, Denver’s public school district “wanted to right [the] wrong” inflicted on the music star as a teenager, according to a CBS report. Officials invited him to a ceremony this week in which they presented him with an honorary diploma symbolizing the one he would have received if the modern rules were in effect at the time he was a student at Manual.

Except, you could be forgiven for thinking that’s how it has been taken, on the basis of the tripling down by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in support of its deluded president in the form of an 808-word defence of Rubiales. The extraordinary RFEF statement – which dropped late on Friday night and is headlined “Official Statement of the RFEF in response to Futpro”, the Spanish players’ union – genuinely reads like it is meant to be Rubiales’ “A-ha! Gotcha!” moment. From threatening Futpro and Jenni Hermoso with legal action to insisting it is an “obligation” for all federated players to participate in national team duty should they be called on, it is a lesson in how, to coin a phrase, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Rubiales is being backed. A staggering 81 women have said they will not play for Spain while he is in charge – but who internally has stood with them? Who edited the statement? Who formatted it for the website? Who posted it? Are they driven by fear or loyalty? And where the hell is their red line? Staggeringly, Rubiales has homed in on the quote attributed to Hermoso in the Futpro statement that says: “In no case did I seek to raise the president.” The RFEF then, at the base of its statement, proceeds to dissect four sequential photographs that appear to show Rubiales being lifted by Hermoso. Except they tell us nothing, nothing of the player’s intent, nothing of whether she lifted, or he leapt. It is a red herring, an irrelevance. The RFEF has picked out that second half of a sentence and bolded it up like it is the key to its “truth v lies” narrative, triumphantly claiming: “The tests are conclusive. Mr President has not lied.” But it is the first half that matters: “I want to clarify, that as seen in the images, at no time did I consent to the kiss he gave me,” Hermoso says. Lift or no lift, embrace or no embrace, Rubiales and the RFEF cannot undo what we all saw (just as Manchester United and Mason Greenwood, who had all the charges against him dropped, cannot undo what we all heard) and that is the president grabbing the face of Hermoso and planting a kiss on her lips. His premise is that it was consensual, her alleged lie about the lift proves she is lying about consent, that he is the truth-teller and the truth will triumph, at least that is what we can assume. A statement, released on Saturday, reasserted these claims of consent and said that “Mrs. Jennifer Hermoso lies in all the statements she makes against the President” before accusing her of attempting to “change reality”. But while we should take the player at her word, when she says no conversation about whether he could kiss her or not took place and that she didn’t like it, that also doesn’t matter. Consent or no consent, the president of the federation, or anyone within any workplace, should not be planting a kiss squarely on to the mouth of another person. It is wholly inappropriate and, coupled with the president’s crotch grab during the Women’s World Cup final, his carrying of Athenea del Castillo over a shoulder, the statements of support from players, clubs and administrators all alluding to a culture of fear and intimidation and the bullish and deluded response from the man himself paints a dark picture of Rubiales’ character. Rubiales and the federation need to wake up. They can stick their heads in the sand over what constitutes sexism, misogyny and abuse all they want, but that will not happen without consequence. Enough has been done and said by Rubiales with the world watching to ensure it is impossible for him to remain, despite his instance otherwise, and his stranglehold on power. Fifa has acted, banning him for 90 days while disciplinary proceedings take place; Uefa, the European governing body, must be next to respond to the overwhelming pressure to take action against its vice-president. But these organisations must look beyond the one man, at the culture of the sport as well as having an introspective look at how these individuals are able to acquire absolute power.

The document from the government’s first energy networks commissioner, Nick Winser, calls for new power linesto be built twice as fast to ease the decade-long backlog of renewable energy projects waiting to connect to the grid. His root-and-branch review proposes 18 measures to help clear the grid backlog after finding that “every part” of the grid upgrade process “must – and can – be dramatically improved”. These recommendations include offering lump sum payments to those living near new pylons, which it said could reduce widespread opposition to projects, and “streamlining” the planning and regulatory process. Winser warned ministers that without new cables and substations more green energy projects were likely to be rolled out before they could be connected to the grid. Currently windfarms and solar arrays face a 10- to 15-year wait to connect to the power networks because grid upgrades cannot keep pace – but these wait times could be halved to about seven years to help Britain meet its green energy targets, according to Winser. “The implications of being able to build wind generation faster than the associated connections to customers will be serious: very high congestion costs for customers, and clean, cheap domestic energy generation standing idle, potentially for years,” Winser said in a letter to Grant Shapps, the energy secretary. The queue for a UK grid connection is the longest in Europe and threatens to undermine the government’s target to roll out 50GW of new wind power and 24GW of new nuclear in the coming decades. The “magnificent achievement” would be “wasted if we cannot get the power to homes and businesses”, Winser said. The report found that grid upgrade delays could even raise energy bills by billions of pounds if the electricity system operator is forced to pay windfarms to stop generating power when constraints in the network mean that strong supplies of green energy cannot be delivered to areas of higher power demand. The grid delays have sparked a row within the industry over who bears responsibility for the backlog. Renewable energy developers have been critical of National Grid, which owns most of the UK’s power lines. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 energy company has called on the regulator, Ofgem, to change the rules to allow greater investment in its networks. Ofgem has called the delays “unacceptable”. Dan McGrail, the chief executive of the trade association RenewableUK, welcomed the report. He said: “Our electricity network is the single biggest barrier to delivering a zero-carbon power system by 2035.” Carl Trowell, the president of strategic infrastructure at National Grid, said: “There is no time to waste. Implementing the proposals and progressing the energy transition at pace is the surest route to more affordable bills, greater energy resilience and a more energy independent UK.” The recommendations include setting up a “future system operator” to undertake a forecast of the grid upgrades required across the country. It also puts forward ideas for better collaboration between the regulator, government and the companies that own Britain’s grids, which include Scottish Power and SSE as well as National Grid. It also cited the need for “transparent, respectful and efficient” engagement with local communities and people about the impact of new transmission infrastructure such as overhead power lines and substations which will be needed in the future. “Clear guidance on how communities can comment on the design of projects to reduce their visual impact, as well as ways to enable communities hosting new infrastructure to benefit from doing so, will be important steps forward,” McGrail said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T15:00:22Z","webTitle":"Let’s talk nuclear, the Coalition says – just don’t mention cost or how long it would take | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","fields":{"bodyText":"The Coalition appears to have landed on a neat solution to decarbonising Australia’s electricity grid – just swap out the coal plants for nuclear. Writing in the Australian newspaper, the shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, said such a plan would reduce the need to spend billions on new transmission lines that would connect solar and windfarms to the grid. O’Brien wrote he had visited Wyoming, where the Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower was planning a demonstration nuclear power station on the site of a coal plant. The idea was backed by the Australian itself in an editorial that said the Coalition’s “timid embrace of nuclear must be urgently considered”. But what neither O’Brien, nor the Australian, mentions is the cost of the plant to build and the time that’s available to do it. The Albanese government wants 82% of the generation capacity in the national electricity market to be powered by renewables by 2030. Construction hasn’t started yet on TerraPower’s demonstration plant and it isn’t expected to start producing power until late 2029 (already pushed back almost two years without work having even started). The cost? The Australian doesn’t say this ether but, according to TerraPower, a budget of more than $6bn is available for the Wyoming project – shared 50/50 between the company and the federal government. The plant’s capacity is 350MW – less than a quarter the size of many coal plants. Future versions of the technology – if it succeeds – would probably get cheaper. But by then the expectation is that Australia’s electricity grid already would be running on very high levels of renewable electricity. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Argument for delay? In a pro-nuclear editorial, the Australian wrote that in a “properly planned energy transition”, policymakers should consider technology “that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions using existing network infrastructure”. According to the Australian energy regulator, the transmission network that forms part of the national electricity market is an asset worth $22.8bn. Much of that asset has been built and designed to cater for fossil fuel generation – mostly coal – which needs to be phased out to meet the country’s climate targets (and is also being pushed out by cheaper renewables whose fuel price is essentially zero). The government has promised $20bn in finance to upgrade the grid to accommodate renewable energy generation and storage. But the pace at which you could theoretically deploy the kind of “small modular reactor” nuclear plants being advocated – but not yet commercially available – would mean sitting on your hands until at least the end of the decade in the hope that the SMRs eventuate and are not eye-wateringly expensive. When the Australian and the Coalition argue for an energy transition that uses “existing infrastructure”, they’re arguing against renewables, and for delay. True costs? In two columns in recent weeks, the Australian’s Claire Lehmann has attacked a report from the CSIRO, saying one metric that’s used to illustrate how much different generation technologies cost per megawatt hour doesn’t account for the extra money spent in the network to accommodate renewables. The metric – known as the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) – in the GenCost report shows that solar and wind installed now (in a grid mostly designed for fossil fuels) are easily the cheapest. The report treats the significant costs for transmission and storage up to 2030 as “sunk” – that is, already committed. After 2030, the GenCost report does estimate the extra costs of integrating renewables but still sees them as the cheapest option – and roughly half the price of nuclear. Tennant Reed, the director of climate change and energy at the Australian Industry Group, questions the focus on LCOE. He says it is an imperfect measure – an issue acknowledged by GenCost – and has a history of being critiqued by groups. Reed says many people who are engaged in energy issues “go through a teenage phase of thinking that levelised cost of energy is the most important thing in the world” and thinking it proves more than it actually does. “It’s a rough guide, but it’s not the basis for any decisions,” he says. “There’s no effort to conceal anything here.” Communist takeover? In case you missed it, US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay almost US$1.5bn last year after claiming the 2012 mass killing of 26 staff and students at the Sandy Hook elementary school had been faked (he’s since acknowledged it happened). The One Nation senator and climate science denier Malcolm Roberts was given almost an hour on the flagship show on Jones’s InfoWars network – the Alex Jones Show – last week. “He’s a gift to Australia and gift to the world,” said the guest host on the show, introducing Roberts. What did the gift bring? It’s not really the kind of rhetoric you can factcheck but, for the record, Roberts told viewers the United Nations and the World Economic Forum were “trying to control and limit energy” and they wanted to “control everything that we eat”. “They are pushing a communist takeover,” Roberts said. “What they are wanting is global control. They’re not my words. They’ve said that.” I don’t think they have."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T22:48:24Z","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic resists Hubert Hurkacz’s power to build two-set lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","fields":{"bodyText":"Novak Djokovic is the best tennis player in the world, yet the task of facing him on a tennis court is far more than just forehands and backhands. As a 23-time grand slam champion who has recovered from every possible scoreline deficit, few can even match up to the challenge of standing up to his aura and reputation. Late on Sunday night, as curfew beckoned and time ran out, Hubert Hurkacz fought a losing battle with Djokovic’s aura as he generated three set points before freezing in the decisive moments. Djokovic will return on Monday afternoon to complete his Wimbledon fourth round match against the Pole while leading 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6) after yet another day of play was halted by the All England Club’s strict 11pm curfew. Djokovic and Hurkacz had emerged just before 9pm after a marathon day of play on Centre Court, with Andrey Rublev narrowly surviving Alexander Bublik in five sets before Iga Swiatek, the women’s No 1, recovered from two match points down to defeat Belinda Bencic after three hours. Still, the inability of the tournament to complete a regular day’s play will lead to further criticism of the All England Club’s decision to start matches on Centre Court at 1.30pm. The defining question of the men’s tournament this year is whether anyone in the draw is truly capable of defeating Djokovic. Hurkacz, a 26-year-old who has scaled as high as No 9 and won a Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open in 2021, was on the very short list of players in the bottom half capable of causing Djokovic strife. He remains one of the few of the younger generation whose game has proven a natural fit for grass. Hurkacz’s serve, one of the best in the world, is devastating on the surface, his flatter strokes well suited to its lower bounce and the Pole’s willingness to move forward to the net is naturally rewarded on the surface. Two years ago, Hurkacz reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, defeating Roger Federer in what proved to be the final match of the Swiss’s career. Imbued with that experience of a big win on the very same court, Hurkacz flew out the blocks, easing through his opening service games while playing clear-headed attacking tennis. His serve, which scaled 141mph as the crack of the ball echoed around Centre Court, was at times unreadable for one of the best returners of all time. As Hurkacz soared, his spectacular serving meant the margins were tiny. At 3-3 in the tie-break, Djokovic double-faulted, offering up the first mini-break. Hurkacz responded swiftly, slamming down two consecutive aces that carried him to triple set point at 6-3. But then it all unravelled. After Djokovic pulled both of his service points back, at 6-5 Hurkacz fired down a 130mph serve and presented himself with an easy forehand which he dumped into the net. Two more unforced errors quickly followed from Hurkacz, who returned to chair having missed an enormous opportunity. With one set behind him the clock ticking down, Djokovic’s returning improved and he imposed maximum pressure on his challenger, who courageously hung on with the force of his serve. At 2-1, Djokovic generated a break point on Hurkacz’s serve, to which the Pole responded with three consecutive aces to hold. Djokovic pounced again, forcing triple break point at 0-40. Three unreturned serves later, the world No 18 recovered to deuce before saving a fourth break point with an incredibly fortunate stretch volley that bounced awkwardly and flew back over his side of the net. Both serves initially dominated the second-set tie-break that followed. At 5-5, though, Djokovic spectacularly retrieved a 136mph serve while lunging at full stretch, then he anticipated Hurkacz’s inside out forehand and flicked a backhand low to the Pole’s feet that set up an easy winner. Although he did not take the first set point, Djokovic took the final two points of the tie-break to establish a two-set lead. Djokovic’s suffocating aura would be nothing without the genius behind it. Throughout the match, the Serb matched Hurkacz’s enormous serving with his own precise, effective delivery. Even as he watched aces fly past him throughout the two sets, on nearly every decisive point, Djokovic found a way to land a return, to retrieve one more ball and to ensure that he gave nothing away. He forced his younger challenger to step up and beat him, and in both sets the Pole could not. After taking the second set, Djokovic immediately signalled that the match had finished for the night, tossing a wristband into the crowd before packing his bag and leaving the court alongside Hurkacz. Having opted against competing on grass between his French Open victory and the start of Wimbledon, Djokovic has been charged with finding his feet and form during the tournament. So far, things continue to go well and he will return on Monday afternoon to finish the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/29/nuclear-waste-australia-how-much-why-kimba-lucas-heights","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-28T15:00:13Z","webTitle":"Australia’s nuclear waste is scattered in ‘cupboards and filing cabinets’ – and the pile is growing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/29/nuclear-waste-australia-how-much-why-kimba-lucas-heights","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/29/nuclear-waste-australia-how-much-why-kimba-lucas-heights","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 20 tonnes of reprocessed nuclear fuel will stay at Australia’s only reactor in southern Sydney, while nuclear waste will remain scattered in “cupboards and filing cabinets” around the country, after the federal court blocked plans for a long-term storage site in outback South Australia.

Successive governments and agencies have said there are more than 100 sites that are storing nuclear waste littered across the land, in hospital basements and universities, on defence and mining sites and in research laboratories. There’s no definitive list, because of a licensing split between the federal and state governments, but the vast majority is produced and stored at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) facility in Lucas Heights. A national inventory published last year found Australia’s 2,061 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste (ILW) will more than double to 4,377 cubic metres in the next 50 years. ILW is generated from the production of nuclear medicine including from the reactor at Ansto and needs purpose-built containers with shielding. The inventory predicted that the 2,490 cubic metres of low-level waste will more than quadruple to 13,287 within the next five decades.

Much of it can be left to “delay and decay”, and can be disposed of as regular rubbish. Ansto’s waste makes up about 93% of the LLW, and about 96.5% of the ILW. Ansto is also responsible for the spent fuel rods from its Opal research reactor at Lucas Heights, in Sydney’s south, which are sent to France, the UK or the US for reprocessing. Last year, the UK shipped two tonnes of ILW to be stored at Sydney’s Lucas Heights facility until it could be transported to a national facility – it was part of a waste-swap deal after Australia sent spent fuel rods from Opal predecessor to be recycled. In 2015, 25 tonnes of radioactive waste from France was returned to Australia after reprocessing – that too will be housed at Lucas Heights until a dump is selected and built. Since then, Australia has sent more spent fuel rods to France to have the uranium and plutonium extracted, but their return has not been announced, and it’s not clear what will happen with such deals now that Kimba option is off the table. The current government policy is to build a National Radioactive Waste Management Facility (NRWMF) to dispose of LLW permanently, and ILW temporarily while a permanent dump is built. The traditional owners of the land around Kimba, the Barngarla people, took the government to court, and won – former resources minister Keith Pitt’s declaration of the site was cast aside because of his “apprehended bias” and “pre-judgement”. Now, the process is on hold as the government considers the judgement, and as the case continues with final details to be ironed out. Top nuclear waste expert, emeritus professor Ian Lowe, says waste is kept in “cupboards and filing cabinets in universities and hospitals”. “When I was in the department of applied physics at the University of NSW [in the 60s], the used sources that had come to the end of their useful life were just in a locked cupboard,” he says. When calling for a national storage site, politicians have variously said the waste is kept in filing cabinets, shipping containers, under stairs and in basements. “It’s clearly not optimal … the reason it hasn’t been a problem is there’s not actually anything very nasty you can do with low level waste. It’s not very radioactive,” Lowe says. Ansto says such waste needs “minimal shielding”, while some major hospitals use “delay tanks” and other facilities use drums. So, Lowe says, finding a national waste repository is not urgent because it has been stored this way for 60 years. Lowe, who is from Griffith University, says it’s not even clear if centralising the waste is the best option. He says there’s an implicit risk in transporting the waste from the various sites to a new site, and there should be a safety comparison with leaving it where it is. “I haven’t even seen a crude, back of the envelope calculation,” he says. With the intermediate level waste, which is “much nastier stuff”, he says he “couldn’t see the point of moving it from temporary storage at Lucas Heights to temporary storage at Kimba while we work out a permanent solution”. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and the Greens are pushing for it to remain at Lucas Heights for now. The ACF’s Dave Sweeney says the waste at Lucas Heights is secure, and that keeping it there could be a “circuit breaker” after years of political wrangling. He accepts that Lucas Heights is not set up to permanently dispose of the waste, but points out that the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency has said it is safe there. And, he says, much of the LLW currently being managed in hospitals was never going to get to Kimba anyway. On top of all that, Kimba was only ever going to hold ILW temporarily until a permanent facility was built. “We need to actually take a breath and get very serious, systematic and credible about how we advance radioactive waste management,” he says. “[This shows] the need for and a clear ability to deliver a circuit breaker and inject some responsibility, credibility and respect into this process.” A spokesperson for resources minister, Madeleine King, said it would be inappropriate to comment on the future of a NRWMF while the Barngarla case is still before the court. The government has lodged a submission to the federal court and could appeal the decision. Ansto says it is “international best practice” to have a single facility, and that Lucas Heights is not the “appropriate place” for the waste to be held. It says the Ansto campus is not big enough, and that it will be full in 15 years anyway. Lowe says only Finland and Sweden have managed to solve the issue with long-term waste storage, and they did it by finding communities who are keen to have the waste in return for investment. He says permanent disposal of all types of waste will need somewhere geologically stable. “That probably means remote parts of SA, WA, NT, but there’s any number of parts of Australia. “The point is finding a community that’s happy to have it there.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T14:04:50Z","webTitle":"New Jersey community loses electricity after bird drops fish on to power lines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","fields":{"bodyText":"An unusual suspect is being sought by police for a power outage in New Jersey: an osprey that dropped a fish on to power lines, causing a nearby community to temporarily lose their electricity. A fish that fell from the grip of the bird in question landed on a transformer in Sayreville, New Jersey, on 12 August, causing the coils within it to become misaligned, according to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, a utility company. This caused about 2,000 people to lose power, the company said. While animals can sometimes cause power outages, “fish are not on the list of frequent offenders”, a company spokesperson said. “We also send our thoughts to the osprey because if you’ve ever dropped your ice-cream cone at the fair, you know the feeling.” It’s suspected that an osprey was responsible for the unexpected, fishy interruption. The fish’s scales appeared punctured, likely by talons, and it is thought that it was then dropped over the power lines. Ospreys were previously endangered in New Jersey but are now recovering, with 733 nesting pairs of the large, fish-eating raptors documented across the state in a survey last year. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light said that it regularly inspects its equipment to see if ospreys have nested there, relocating them if necessary. Police in Sayreville, somewhat tongue in cheek, posted a suspect sketch of an osprey on Facebook, along with a picture of the fish, which was given the name Gilligan, with a “police line do not cross” tape in front of it. “Please let us not forget the victim in this senseless death,” the police force posted. “Gilligan was a hard working family man. He was a father to thousands of children. The suspect was last seen flying south. If you see him do not try to apprehend him. Although he isn’t believed to be armed he may still be very dangerous.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2023.

The Ipsos poll, conducted for Spain’s La Vanguardia newspaper, found that 42.1% of those surveyed were very worried by the idea of Vox sharing power with the conservative People’s party (PP), while 18% were quite worried. Recent polls suggest the PP is on course to win the most seats on 23 July, but may well need to forge a coalition with Vox to reach an absolute majority of 176 seats in Spain’s 350-seat congress. The election, originally due to be held at the end of the year, was brought forward after the socialist-led coalition government of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suffered a drubbing in May’s regional and municipal elections. Sánchez has warned that a PP-Vox alliance would reverse the progress his government has made on equality, rights and the environment, and accused the PP of assuming “the policies and postures of Vox”. The socialist leader is hoping that his party and the new leftwing Sumar alliance will instead attract enough voters to build their own ruling coalition. The Ipsos poll found that 26% of respondents were very worried by the idea of a socialist-Sumar government, while 15% were quite worried. Despite insisting that the PP party is a centre-right, moderate group, its leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, has shown himself to be open to a national coalition with Vox, and the PP has already struck deals with the far-right party to jointly govern many towns and cities as well as the regions of Castilla y León, Valencia and Extremadura. Although the PP’s candidate in Extremadura initially ruled out any alliances with Vox because of the far-right party’s denial of gender-based violence and demonisation of migrants, she performed a swift U-turn at the end of June. Both the PP and Vox have repeatedly criticised Sánchez’s minority government for its reliance on Basque and Catalan pro-independence parties, and for its botched and unpopular sexual consent law under which more than 100 sex offenders were inadvertently released from jail. Sánchez’s dealings with the Basque nationalist party EH Bildu came under renewed scrutiny in the run-up to the May elections after it emerged that the party was fielding 44 convicted members of the defunct Basque terror group Eta, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates. Speaking at a campaign rally on Sunday, Vox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, accused the prime minister of hypocrisy, saying: “Pedro Sánchez has said that you have to vote for him to protect democracy – and that from a prime minister who came to power by lying to the Spanish people and making deals with the enemies of democracy, of the constitutional order and of coexistence.” In particularly inflammatory comments, Abascal added: “As far as Pedro Sánchez is concerned, protecting democracy is about getting the votes of rapists, coup-mongers, [the convicted Eta murderer] Txapote and of Mohammed.” Leading Spanish cultural figures have also expressed deep concern over the PP and Vox’s attitude to the arts after several incidents of apparent censorship by councils run by the right or far right. The director of a play about a Republican teacher who was murdered during the Spanish civil war has accused the council of Briviesca in Castilla y León of censoring the work after it cancelled performances, although the council has insisted the decision was taken because of logistical and safety concerns rather than on ideological grounds. It also emerged last week that the PP-Vox council of the northern Spanish town of Bezana had apparently cancelled a screening of the Toy Story spin-off film Lightyear because it features a kiss between two women – a scene that led to the movie being banned in Saudi Arabia. Vox has also been accused of vetoing a theatrical adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s time-travelling, gender-shifting classic Orlando because its protagonist “goes from being a man to a woman”. Last week, members of the newly formed Free Arts Platform released an open letter deploring the eruption of censorship. “As professionals in the world of culture, we wish to denounce the return of censorship that is attacking freedom of expression – a social and democratic right enshrined in our constitution,” they said. “We demand the protection of our fundamental rights because, without culture, there is no democracy.” Another letter from dozens of Spain’s cultural titans – including the film-maker Pedro Almodóvar – has urged voters to turn out in force to preserve the social and environmental progress made by Sánchez’s government. “The general election on 23 July will be particularly decisive,” they wrote. “It’s clear that we’re in the midst of a new conservative offensive – one with a far-right drift – not just in Spain but in many countries across Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/28/uk-to-run-only-one-coal-fired-power-plant-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-28T16:47:54Z","webTitle":"UK to run only one coal-fired power plant this winter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/28/uk-to-run-only-one-coal-fired-power-plant-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/28/uk-to-run-only-one-coal-fired-power-plant-this-winter","fields":{"bodyText":"Britain will be down to its last coal-fired energy plant this winter after Drax scrapped a proposal to bring two coal-fired units at its vast power plant in North Yorkshire out of retirement to help guard against power cuts. The FTSE 250 energy company had been in talks with National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) to restart two coal power units that were shut this year after 50 years of coal-fired generation at the Drax site near Selby. Drax said it had concluded that “a combination of technical, maintenance and staffing reasons” meant it would not be possible to extend the life of its coal plants to this winter. The ESO had also held talks with EDF about making its West Burton A coal-fired power plant available this winter, but the French energy company moved ahead with its plans to close the Nottinghamshire plant in April this year after a lifespan of 57 years. That means the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal power plant – also in Nottinghamshire and owned by German utility Uniper – will be the last remaining coal plant on standby to generate power for the electricity grid this winter to avert blackouts if supplies run short. The ESO said earlier this month that it would be watching the energy industry “like hawks” this winter in case Russia’s war on Ukraine triggers further energy supply disruptions in the global market similar to those that led to record high prices last year. It spent around £400m keeping the Drax, West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plants on standby over last winter. The energy secretary, Grant Shapps, said earlier this year that it would be “crazy” not to have the plants on standby again this winter. But the ESO said its early forecasts for the coming winter’s electricity supplies showed there would still be more than enough power to meet demand. The power supply “buffer” is expected to be 4.8GW, or 8% of the UK’s total electricity supplies, which the ESO said was “really healthy” and higher than last winter. The Ratcliffe coal plant is expected to remain open until September 2024, and was called on to fire up earlier this month during a surge in electricity demand driven by large numbers of air conditioning units being switched on to tackle rising temperatures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/28/saudi-arabia-glastonbury-popwashing-soundstorm-festival-pop-music","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-28T09:00:00Z","webTitle":"What’s behind Saudi Arabia’s answer to Glastonbury?

We’re not. Actually, Glastonbury is pretty much a minnow compared with the biggest music festival in the world. Soundstorm, held each December, attracts more than triple the Glastonbury crowd, but you don’t hear the headliners wanging on about what a life-changing experience it was. You don’t hear them mention it at all, to be honest. I only heard of it earlier this year, when the CEO of a big production company talked about his firm’s work on the event. The reason you don’t hear about it is that Soundstorm is held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Pop music is the lesser-known outpost of the reputation-laundering of repressive regimes. The sportswashing efforts of various Middle Eastern regimes – the Qatar World Cup, grands prix in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia’s LIV golf tour and, most visibly, the takeovers of football clubs by various sovereign wealth funds – have been pored over and criticised, but pop’s involvement in cultural reputation-laundering has been largely ignored. In addition to Soundstorm, artists have been condemned, albeit in passing, for playing private and public concerts in repressive states. Beyoncé played for an invited audience of influencers and journalists in Dubai, UAE earlier this year, for a reported $24m fee. Homosexuality is illegal in the United Arab Emirates and considered a crime potentially punishable by death. Mariah Carey, Nelly, Janet Jackson and Future have all played shows in Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch has criticised the state for, among other things, the arrests of peaceful dissidents, state executions and the continuation of the male guardianship system for women (despite some reforms). It doesn’t always end this way, with Steps last week refusing to play in Dubai, after rejecting a contract clause demanding they not mention sexuality. Pop and rock are more complicated, culturally, than sport. It’s entirely explicable that it tends only to be when artists announce their intention to play in Israel that the boos are long and hard, as fans protest against the state’s policies towards Palestinians. Pop still likes to think of itself as countercultural (despite decades of evidence to the contrary, such as numerous corporate tie-ins), so it tends to align with causes perceived as being leftwing – and there’s no firmer signifier of your leftwingness than wanting to boycott Israel in support of Palestine. But I struggle to see why, say, Michael Kiwanuka playing Soundstorm last year passed without a whisper, while any artist playing in Tel Aviv can expect to be flayed on social media. Because of that expectation that musicians will always be on the side of the angels, and their desire to maintain their fanbase, they inevitably act in a hypocritical way. They will say the right thing, and do whatever is in their best interests. Beyoncé is a case in point: that Dubai show wasn’t her first troubling acceptance of money – she played at the Gaddafi family’s 2009 New Year’s Eve party. (The artist later revealed that she gave the complete payment and all commissions to help support earthquake relief in Haiti.) Or take the 1975, a band I think are great, who pledged in 2020 only to play festival bills with a gender-balanced lineup, yet still last year headlined Reading and Leeds, a festival criticised in 2020 for the maleness of its lineups. But, in all honesty, I find it hard to blame them. A pop or rock star makes nothing like the money their equivalent did when I was a kid. I have one friend in a band, all of whose albums have made the top five, who headlines festivals across Europe. In the 1980s that would have bought him a country pile, a townhouse and a place in New York. In the present day it has bought him a tiny house in an insalubrious area of north-west London. For all the projection of glamour, the vast majority of musicians do not get to live “rock star” lifestyles. A very average professional footballer in the Premier League earns as much in a month as a hugely successful musician might in a year. And for all the talk of sportspeople having short careers and needing to maximise their earnings, the same is true of musicians, who also face the simple peril of going out of fashion and seeing their livelihoods evaporate. The difference, though, is that no one thinks Cristiano Ronaldo is a hero of social justice, and nor does he make any effort to portray himself as one. Beyoncé does. All the stars who ride on the back of social justice movements and then fly off to the Arabian peninsula deserve to be criticised not for needing to make a living, but for saying one thing and doing another. In fact, that’s an age-old faultline in music, going back to the Clash being castigated by harder-line punks for “turning rebellion into money” and beyond. Which brings us back to Steps. Whoever thought they would be the band to walk it like they talk it? There are much edgier stars who could learn from H, Claire, Faye, Lisa and Lee.

He hovers and lurks. He swoops and steals. He glides in, and accelerates out of a contest. On Saturday night, he anticipated the spill from a throw in, met the ball at full cruising speed, took it in his left hand, switched to his right, consulted his protractor, caressed the ball on the lateral column of his preferred foot, and let it tumble, talk, and taunt its way past the scrambling Gold Coast defender. From gather to goal-line, it took about 3.5 seconds. There’s been some preposterous goals kicked at the Adelaide Oval, almost all of them by Eddie Betts. Commentator Dwayne Russell, not always renowned for his restraint at such moments, called it “one of the greatest goals of all time.” It was certainly equal to this year’s offerings from Brody Mihocek, Jamie Elliott and Dan Houston. It was the standout moment of a remarkable Port Adelaide quarter. Gold Coast, who haven’t beaten them for a decade, and who have had Caroline Wilson on their hammer all week, fought admirably in the first half. But this Port Adelaide side has gears. Ken Hinkley gave them a rocket at half time, and they responded by doubling the Suns’ possessions and slamming on nine goals. Port can win any which way. They can blow you away early, or mow you down late. They can thrash you, or sink you after the siren. They can win in the slop, or on a dry, still afternoon. Their best football this year – the first half against Hawthorn, and the third quarters of the Geelong and Gold Coast games - has been as good as anyone’s. Their midfield has depth, but also flexibility. They rotate more players than most sides. It’s an ideal mix of thoroughbreds and pit ponies, of ageing and emerging, of stars and role players. It was Willem Drew’s clampdown on Matthew Rowell in the third term that allowed Rozee to flourish. In recent months, more selfless roles from Ollie Wines and Travis Boak has unleashed Zak Butters. Some seasons, the top teams aren’t the most interesting, best to watch, or most likely to capture the interest of neutrals. But Port and Collingwood are the ones you seek out in the fixture each week. Even if you have a rabid hatred of those clubs, and plenty do, you’d be a right footy Scrooge if you don’t enjoy watching them play. A final word on Charlie Dixon, who celebrated his 200th game. Ken Hinkley has the permanently chuffed look of a proud dad, but he’s especially fond of his big full forward. “Charlie’s 200 feels like 400,” he said on Saturday. Charlie cops his share of flak. You take the good with the bad with him. He has his limitations, and his quirks. He vaguely resembles the bushranger Captain Melville, who, when he wasn’t robbing stage coaches, was renowned for his affability and chivalry. Hinkley’s been coaching Dixon for nearly a decade and a half now and he gives him a lot of rope. He gives away silly frees, misses easy shots and is forever on the verge of blowing a gasket. But he gives everything. He straightens them up. They’re always a better side when Dixon is there. At 32, he’s been labouring late in games recently, but when the whips were cracking in the third term, he was pivotal. For Port fans, a loss to their South Australian rivals would have capped off the weekend nicely. The Crows watched a documentary on the life of Ernest Shackleton in the lead up, and for the first 15 minutes looked like they were playing in the explorer’s finnesko boots. Essendon, the 18th ranked clearance team, were slaughtering them out of the middle. But the visitors woke up and knuckled down. On one of those Melbourne days where the sky hung like a giant grey duvet, footy under a roof never seemed so appealing. The first half was an old-fashioned shoot out, the type of which we rarely see in the modern game. But it was the Bombers who were the more potent. They’re a normal team and normal club again. There’s an absence of turmoil on and off the field. There’s tactical coherence. They know when to go slow, and when to release the brakes. They beat Carlton in about 15 minutes - and for Essendon fans it doesn’t get sweeter than that. Yesterday was their best win of the year. It was an eight-point game – and a glimpse of the future. Ben Hobbs, just 19-years-old and hailing from the same draft as Nick Daicos, Jason Horne-Francis and Josh Rachele, played a slashing game. They absorbed Adelaide’s punches in the third term. They jumped four spots to fifth and left Adelaide back in the pack, with a Showdown and trips to the MCG and Gabba still in front of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/31/chris-minns-rules-out-underground-power-lines-for-controversial-humelink-project-due-to-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-31T06:34:29Z","webTitle":"Chris Minns rules out underground power lines for controversial HumeLink project due to cost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/chris-minns-rules-out-underground-power-lines-for-controversial-humelink-project-due-to-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/31/chris-minns-rules-out-underground-power-lines-for-controversial-humelink-project-due-to-cost","fields":{"bodyText":"Premier Chris Minns has poured cold water on the potential of “undergrounding” the transmission line project that will be built across regional New South Wales to connect renewable energy zones and carry clean energy across the country. The controversial HumeLink project is vital to the country’s energy transmission, with the Australian Energy Market Operator estimating Australia needs more than 10,000km of new transmission lines and a ninefold increase in large-scale wind and solar energy. The HumeLink project has faced fierce opposition from affected property owners and communities, with groups arguing overground lines will increase the fire risk, make it harder to farm and create ecological damage. On Thursday Minns confirmed the government would push forward with plans to construct overland transmission lines. “It is [off the table],” he said about undergrounding. “And the reason for that is the cost. I mean, we’re already seeing extensive increasing costs for energy prices in NSW.” Asked if he was taking a “tough-luck” approach to the affected communities, Minns said there was compensation for landholders who were impacted. “Most estimates indicate that undergrounding those cables is three times the cost of putting them overhead,” he said. “And that’s a cost that will be borne by businesses, households and consumers in NSW. It’s just too much money to pay.” The premier’s comments followed the release of a parliamentary committee report on the viability of the HumeLink going underground, which recommended the current plan for constructing overhead transmission lines was the best way to complete the project. But groups opposing the 360km of lines being built overground said the NSW government had chosen to completely ignore the concerns of farmers, ecologists and engineers and vowed to keep fighting the proposal. They were backed by Nationals MPs and the Greens, who criticised the inquiry as “a missed opportunity” and a box-ticking exercise. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Network operator Transgrid previously told the NSW parliamentary inquiry the cost of running all of the HumeLink underground could more than triple its cost to $17bn. In the wake of the report, Transgrid said it was “steadfastly committed to engagement with communities” and would continue to work with them to find “solutions to balance the local impacts, consumer costs, time constraints and concerns regarding supply reliability”. “These critical transmission projects will not only support increased competition in renewable generation and enable the nation to achieve a clean energy future – they are urgently needed to ensure the security of a safe, reliable electricity supply for millions of Australians,” a spokesperson said. The projected cost of the overland link had already blown out from $3.3bn to nearly $4.9bn. Community spokesperson Michael Katz accused the government of relying on biased evidence and said landowners would continue to fight the project. “The Minns government has failed to bring any innovative policy change on this important issue and, instead, has been captured by the vested interests of a private company,” he said. Katz said the entire inquiry was “predetermined and a complete sham” before questioning the stated cost of undergrounding. “It is a slap in the face for the hard-working and caring people of these communities who tried in good faith to offer workable alternative solutions which were met with disdain.” The Greens infrastructure spokesperson and committee member Cate Faehrmann labelled the inquiry recommendation a “missed opportunity”, with the finding only supported by government members. “It does not reflect the evidence that was presented to the committee, which was overwhelmingly against overhead transmission lines,” she said. Faehrmann labelled the inquiry a “tick and flick exercise” to make it seem like the government was taking community concerns around transmission line projects seriously. The Nationals MP Wes Fang said the decision would “break the hearts of those rural and regional landholders”. “Questions need to be asked around the cost of this inquiry, including charter flights and regional hearings, when the premier indicated on radio a month ago the decision was already made,” Fang said. “This alone is another example of the Labor party wasting taxpayers’ money.” Australian Associated Press contributed to this report."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/jul/09/the-big-picture-pixy-liao-playfully-explores-relationship-power-dynamics","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T06:00:36Z","webTitle":"The big picture: Pixy Liao playful​ly explores​ relationship power dynamics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/09/the-big-picture-pixy-liao-playfully-explores-relationship-power-dynamics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/jul/09/the-big-picture-pixy-liao-playfully-explores-relationship-power-dynamics","fields":{"bodyText":"In the introduction to her project Experimental Relationship, the New York-based photographer Pixy Liao writes: “As a woman brought up in China, I used to think I could only love someone who is older and more mature than me, who can be my protector and mentor. Then I met my current boyfriend, Moro. Since he is five years younger than me, I felt that the whole concept of relationships changed, all the way around. I became a person who has more authority and power. One of my male friends even questioned how I could choose a boyfriend the way a man would choose a girlfriend. And I thought: ‘Damn right. That’s exactly what I’m doing, and why not!’” Experimental Relationship is a deadpan examination of that perceived reversal of power. Liao creates situations in which Moro appears passive or submissive to her whims in order to “explore the alternative possibilities of heterosexual relationships”. The series has fun with the expectations of the male gaze. Sometimes, Liao is clothed in the portraits and Moro is naked. She carries him over her shoulder in a fireman’s lift, or eats her breakfast off his unclothed body, or stares uncompromisingly into the camera while he places his head, childlike, on her shoulder, or tweaks his nipple. The pictures are more comical than coercive. Here, Moro seems to be getting the wrong end of the candy floss, while Liao enjoys his slight discomfort. The picture is included in a new guide to portrait photography, The Portrait Photographer’s Manual, in the “Family and Friends” section. Liao met Moro on their first day at art school in Memphis. She began taking the pictures after they had been dating for a year; she got the idea from the reaction of Chinese friends and family to her having a younger boyfriend. She and Moro now live together. The project is continuing. • The Portrait Photographer’s Manual is published on 20 July by Thames &amp; Hudson (£16.99).

Why is there suddenly so much of it about – and why is it being smugly swished about in our faces like coiffured, over-fragranced horse tails? I don’t mean young women and girls, for whom long hair occurs almost as a byproduct of youth, and who wear it as insouciantly as a daisy-chain necklace. Nor is this longish hair (gliding down the neck or tickling between the shoulder blades). I’m referring to that faux-casual, triumphantly cascading ultra-long hair (ULH) that’s been called under-the-boob hair. It’s also termed “princess hair”, alongside editorials inviting us mere commoners to gasp over “the Princess of Wales’s memorable hair moments”. (When surely the whole point of royal hair is that it isn’t memorable – in the sense of being confrontational or objectionable – in any way?) Elsewhere, it’s sported by a certain kind of powerful, moneyed, older woman. Gwyneth Paltrow. Demi Moore. Amal Clooney. This, you realise, is hair as a mid-life power move. Hair with inbuilt messaging. Hair that makes the follicular political. Still, “princess hair” – seriously? Even taken as part of the process of the ongoing infantilisation of the 21st-century woman, this seems top-tier creepy and reductive. When do you ever see men hectored into princeing up their hair? Nor is this piece going to be about men preferring the look of longer-haired ladies (it’s a rare and needy modern woman who gives more than 20 seconds of thought to what straight men think of her hair). Still, these power manes are intriguing. Are they about female rebellion (which we could all get behind), or uber-conformity? Or is it just another grooming stick with which to beat beleaguered, exhausted, middle-aged women? There’s a good reason why it’s mainly wealthy celebrities preening about with glossy, voluminous, ultra-long hair. As much as this kind of hair is yet another style that’s exclusionary against black women (though on the “iconic 1980s-supermodels” cover of September’s Vogue, Naomi Campbell aces the look in a beautiful wig), it manages to exclude vast numbers of white women too. This kind of style might look “free and easy” but achieving it would be anything but, especially with older hair. Even if hair doesn’t thin, it ages with the rest of you. Even if you sort out the colour and don’t (always) end up resembling Catweazle or mid-period Alice Cooper, there is still the small matter of (whisper it) texture. Which, if you’re not vigilant, does a simultaneous “limp/crunchy” thing that doesn’t even seem scientifically possible. Thus, one presumes, any attempt to turn the hair on an average middle-aged head into a power mane would require a squad of highly skilled professionals trained in the dark arts of ninja-level tonging/blow-drying, lakes of conditioner, keratin treatments, warehouses of “product”, extensions and so on. Your life would turn into a relentless nightmarish prep for a photoshoot that (unlike the Vogue “supers” or other celebrities) never actually transpires. And that’s not counting the discreet “rejuvenating procedures” to make the face “match” the hair. In your ULH-desperation, you might even find yourself agreeing to the dreaded head massage during the salon hair wash. What have you become? So, “free and easy” be damned. ULH would require the staffing levels of a busy boutique hotel, and the wage bill to match. An ordinary woman would have to groom herself into oblivion or bankruptcy (whichever came first). Or she could go rogue, attempt a budget DIY version, and risk ending up resembling the cackling Disney crone who gives the apple to Snow White. Which, incidentally, I consider to be a strong look (what could be prettier than a woman embracing her inner witch?), but, sadly, that’s not the vibe being chased here. Ultimately, ultra-long hair is a tale as old as time. Leastways, it’s a game of two signifiers. The first being youth. Some people think chopping off your hair is ageing, and that’s that. And, as much as the truly young try to go with trends that defy emulation (all that midriff-baring is no accident), this is an era in which older generations point-blank refuse to age, to cede youth to the young. They wear their clothes, listen to their music, go to their festivals. Now – quelle surprise! – they’re going after their hair. Moreover, as detailed above, ultra-long hair is a wealth signifier, and therefore one of elitism. This is the kind of hair not all ordinary women could afford to access or maintain. It’s a key way of distinguishing yourself from the masses. If the word is out about weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic, and excessive skinniness doesn’t cut it any more, then how about some difficult, expensive, elitist hair? For now, there’s no sorting that out with a pill. All women are entitled to the hair they want, but it turns out the secret of ultra-long hair isn’t much of a secret at all. Rather boringly, it seems to be less about extremism/rebellion/self-expression, and more about elitism. And less about starting a trend and more about keeping all the swishy pampered gorgeousness to yourself.

It also offers ways of getting away from it all with green energy on the go and 3D meeting pods that put Zoom to shame. Solar power start-up As summer rolls in with the lure of camping, travelling and life in the great outdoors, new green-tech start-up Levante is hoping to launch a way to make your getaway a little easier. The company is kickstarting a portable solar panel this month to make trips simpler and more sustainable. Their origami-inspired design will be the most powerful on the market (up to 500W), while being 40% more compact than its competitors. The Milan-based company is run by Sara Plaga and Kim-Joar Myklebust. The couple who met at a music festival in Denmark in 2009, have lived in 10 cities around the world and love spending their spare time sailing and camping. Myklebust previously worked in motorsports and it was his knowledge of composite and mechanical engineering which helped create their new product. It will be made in Turin, Italy. “We’re determined to revolutionise traditional solar panels which are fixed structures constrained to a surface,” says Plaga. “You can use our solar panel in many different settings – just fold it, take it with you and use it in your RV, at home or anywhere you like.” For more details and for the kickstarter page, go to the levante website Building Nigeria Nigerian architect Olajumoke Adenowo says she started her monograph Neo-Heritage because she believes Africans need to define their own history, otherwise others will continue to do it for them. It’s a commendable mission statement and, as Adenowo is one of Nigeria’s most well-known architects, her thoughts on contemporary African buildings in her homeland deserve to be heard on the international stage. Nigeria is also home to hundreds of languages, cultural groups and communities of different heritage, making it a fascinating mixing bowl of ideas and influences. The eldest daughter of two professors, Adenowo spent her childhood in different cities and universities across Africa and Europe. She attended Obafemi Awolowo University in Ife, Osun state, Nigeria, enrolling at the tender age of 14. She says the campus, designed by Bauhaus-trained architect Arieh Sharon, was a big influence on her architectural style. Her other passion is traditional Yoruba buildings and the practical and creative traditions of Nigerian architecture. As well as looking at the ways light, air and ideas of beauty are key to African practice, she also looks at the importance of recycling and reusing expensive and complex materials. And she explains in the introduction to this fascinating book: “If African voices of every race, tutored, nurtured, speaking from the continent, do not define Africa, the African way of life will never be truly understood.” Olajumoke Adenowo’s Neo Heritage – defining Contemporary African Architecture is published by Rizzoli Graphic Rewilding Lee Baker and Catherine Borowski have brought delight to many dull urban sites with their work as public art curators. As the driving force behind Skip Gallery, the pair have had these waste containers turned into houses, libraries and even held art classes in them. But their latest venture gives a new imaginative twist to city landscapes. They’re bringing flowers to the streets with their Graphic Rewilding project. “It’s been shown that exposure even to pictures of plants has a positive effect on the mind,” explains Baker, whose art is used in this new project. “Patients who can see images of nature in hospital waiting rooms have lower levels of stress and anxiety. These pictures increase activity in brain regions associated with attention and emotion regulation.” Baker and Borowski’s nature-inspired installations give building facades floral makeovers and add meadows to billboards. Their latest installation is their largest yet: an attempt to rewild London’s Westfield shopping centre with 8m-high wildflowers. “About 10 years ago I had a breakdown,” says Baker, “and one of the only things that soothed my mind was drawing flowers and making art in forests. The journey of taking my intimate artworks and blowing them up huge has been immensely cathartic. I used to hide the images, almost embarrassed of them, that perhaps they would be judged as unmasculine, populist or shallow.” Both Baker and Borowski grew up in cities, so the pair know how important any oasis can be. “We created a project blending art and planting inspired by Victorian pleasure gardens on unused land on a busy London road. People used the space, to play, to eat their lunch, to relax. They said that there was hardly any public green space in the area and that even our theatrical garden was a hugely welcome addition to their community. This isn’t isolated, we see this reaction time and time again, and it represents what we want people to get from experiencing our art.” Commissioned by Zoë Allen of Artistic Statements, the Rewilding Westfield installation is open over the summer Only connect We can all agree working life has changed post-pandemic. Between hybrid hours, remote working and random Zoom and Teams meetings, company life in 2023 can feel confusing – more WTF than WFH. Now a Finnish company has come up with a novel design that might point the way to a happier, more productive work life. Framery Contact is a virtual meeting pod that recreates the experience of real face-to-face conversations with an accuracy unmatched by your wobbly internet connection and Bluetooth headphones. The visually and acoustically isolated pod uses highly realistic projection technology, LED lighting and active audio monitors to connect you to anyone else using another pod. While traditional video calls hide non-verbal cues – such as body language and eye contact – using Framery Contact means the other person appears in front of you, as if in real life. Very Star Trek. And the pod isn’t just for work: it’s easy to think of applications including connecting with elderly relatives, private consultations or hooking up with loved ones in a way that your phone screen can’t compete with. It can also be used as a sound-proofed, comfy cubicle for getting stuff done. frameryaccoustics.com No place like home London’s blocks of purpose built flats tell the story of the city’s development. These mansion blocks dominate the metropolitan boroughs from Westminster and Kensington’s upscale, if compact, living quarters from the Victoria era to the modest modern-day apartments recently built in Stratford and Kilburn. Introduced in the wake of slum clearance, but also developed as a way to tailor make homes for particular demographics (the bachelor flats of the 1890s didn’t have kitchens, for example), mansion blocks have always been seen as the answer to London’s chronic housing crisis. At Home In London: the Mansion Block is a new survey of these characterful flats and how they came to define London, documenting work by everyone from Victorian architects Boehmer and Gibbs and 1930s modernists such as G Kay Green and Gordon Jeeves to the modern take on mass living by Alison Brooks Architects.

Late last year, a Republican-backed bill passed the state house prohibiting most special elections in August, reasoning that timing an election in the dog days of late summer depressed turnout, and cost too much money. But those same Republicans changed their tune in May, when it became clear that abortion rights supporters in Ohio would be able to put a ballot measure to voters securing abortion rights in the state in the November 2023 election. Ohio has a six-week ban on the books, but it is currently blocked by a court, and abortion remains legal up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. The measure, if passed, would help keep it that way, amending the Ohio state constitution to grant individuals a right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions”. Ballot measures have been extremely successful tools of the pro-choice movement since the supreme court abolished the federal abortion right last year in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health: pro-choice ballot initiatives passed by surprisingly large margins even in Ohio’s heavily Republican neighbor state, Kentucky, as well as the similarly deep-red Kansas. Since Dobbs, every single time abortion rights have been put to the voters, they have prevailed. And so suddenly, the Ohio GOP felt that it was important that a vote be held in August: a vote, that is, to curtail the power of voting. Ohio voters head to the polls on Tuesday to vote on Issue 1, the Republicans’ response to the November constitutional amendment. The sole question posed to voters in the August special election is a direct attempt to stop the legalization of abortion through democratic means: if passed, Issue 1 would make it more difficult for a ballot initiative to be brought to Ohio voters, and more difficult to pass one that was. The rule change would require advocates to collect signatures in all Ohio counties before a proposal could be placed on the ballot – a procedure that would give disproportionate power to rural, conservative parts of the state – and raise the threshold for passage from 50% to 60%. Currently, the pro-choice ballot initiative slated to go before Ohio voters in November polls at about 58% approval. And so the fight over abortion rights and Issue 1 in Ohio has become a proxy for the broader fight many Republicans are waging across the states: when voters don’t like the party’s proposed policies – and overwhelmingly, voters do not like abortion bans – then instead of changing their platforms or setting out to persuade the electorate to change their minds, Republicans simply change the rules, so that the voters’ wishes don’t get in the way of their preferred policy outcomes. Don’t want to vote for the Republican party line? Then state Republicans will make sure that your vote doesn’t matter. The Issue 1 special election is just the latest in a string of efforts by state Republican parties to curtail access to ballot measures. In Missouri, a court ruled that a ballot initiative seeking to legalize abortion could be presented on the 2024 ballot, even though the Republican attorney general there, Andrew Bailey, had tried to stonewall the effort by falsely claiming that the vote would cost the state a gargantuan amount of money. But state Republicans there had already pushed another measure through the state house, requiring ballot initiatives to receive at least 57% of the vote to pass. Like in Ohio, Missouri was unable to keep the abortion rights measure off the ballot. But just as Ohio Republicans are doing, the Missouri GOP tried to rig the process, explicitly to lessen the pro-choice side’s chances. The measure failed in the Missouri state senate, but Republicans there have vowed to try again. Republicans in at least nine other states – Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Maine, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Utah – have also tried to make it harder for ballot initiatives to pass, at least when those initiatives support abortion rights. Abortion is not the only issue where Republicans have sought to curtail access to direct democracy in order to protect their policy goals. In South Dakota, an effort last year to raise the ballot initiative passage threshold to 60% was aimed mostly at stopping Medicaid expansion in the state. (It failed.) But abortion has long been the issue around which America’s anti-democratic forces are most determined and inventive. In Texas, for instance, Republican politicians have responded to local prosecutors in large, Democratic-leaning cities like Houston who say they will not prosecute abortion cases by passing a bill allowing those prosecutors to be removed for “misconduct”. Similar bills aiming to curtail the authority of elected district attorneys over whether or not to enforce criminal abortion bans have also been brought forward by Republicans in Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina. Like the limits on ballot initiatives, the limits on the discretion of local DA’s also aim to end the ability of public opinion to influence policy outcome. If you don’t want to vote for the Republican policy, the Republicans will make sure your vote doesn’t matter; and if you vote in an official who will pursue a different policy, the Republicans will make sure that official loses the authority to do her job. Maybe it’s appropriate that Republicans have made the anti-abortion crusade the focus of so much of their anti-democracy efforts. Abortion bans, after all, are substantively anti-democratic. They are unpopular, yes, imposed by the unelected supreme court. But more importantly they are an insult to citizenship, depriving half of Americans the ability to live their lives with freedom, dignity, bodily integrity and self-determination – preconditions to any meaningful, equal status as citizens. It makes sense that Republicans would embark on sneaky, procedural efforts to undermine abortion in pursuit of this same project. They don’t want to allow women to live as full, equal citizens. But really, they don’t especially want that for anyone else, either. In justifying his decision to overturn Roe v Wade, Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion, wrote that if women didn’t like what he was doing to them, they could just vote. “Women are not without political power,” he wrote. At least, the Republican ones aren’t."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/02/china-swelters-through-record-temperatures-putting-pressure-on-power-grids","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T04:58:46Z","webTitle":"China swelters through record temperatures, putting pressure on power grids","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/02/china-swelters-through-record-temperatures-putting-pressure-on-power-grids","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/02/china-swelters-through-record-temperatures-putting-pressure-on-power-grids","fields":{"bodyText":"Temperatures across China reached or exceeded their records for the month of May, the country’s National Climate Centre has said. Weather stations at 446 sites registered temperatures that were the same as, or greater than, the highest ever recorded for the month of May, deputy director of the National Climate Centre Gao Rong said at a press briefing on Friday. On Monday, the Shanghai Meteorology Bureau reported that the city had recorded a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius. The previous record for May was 35.7C, which occurred in 2018. Over the next three days, most of southern China is expected to be hit by temperatures of more than 35C, with temperatures in some areas exceeding 40C, according to national forecasters on Friday. Power grids are preparing to be put under strain as demand for airconditioning soars in mega-cities such as Shanghai. Demand for electricity in southern manufacturing hubs, including Guangdong, has surged in recent days, with China Southern Power Grid, one of the country’s two grid operators, seeing peak power load exceeding 200m kilowatts – weeks earlier than normal and close to historical highs. The sweltering heat comes amid a year of rising temperatures and erratic weather in China. In February, the China Meteorological Administration warned that “extreme weather and climate events are still showing a high incidence and intensity [for the year]”. In March, temperatures in Wuhan and Zhengzhou, cities in central China, were more than 10 degrees higher than normal for that time of year. Unusually for China, 2023 has seen the arid north of the country hotter than the south, a pattern that is thought to be causing a range of ecological problems. Since last summer, the Yangtze river basin has experienced the worst drought since 1961, hurting local grain harvests. Chinese government statistics show that since July last year, rainfall in the Yangtze river basin has declined by nearly 50%. The water level in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river, Poyang and Dongting Lakes, which are the largest and the second-largest freshwater lakes in China, are the lowest in history for the same period. Yunnan province in south-west China has also been experiencing a drought since the beginning of this year, with average down 60% compared with the same period in 2022, and the average temperature up 0.8 degrees., according to government agencies. Nearly a million people in the province are suffering from drought, with nearly 200,000 needing some kind of assistance from the government.

As the heavy early morning rain began to ease, the summit’s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko, welcomed leaders and their spouses at the entrance to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, where they viewed graphic reminders of the attack on the city on 6 August 1945 and its gruesome aftermath. The Japanese leader – whose wife wore a gold pin shaped like an origami crane, a symbol of the city’s nuclear legacy – has said that achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is his “life’s work”. Joe Biden became the second sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, after Barack Obama in 2016, while Rishi Sunak is the first British prime minister to visit the site of the world’s first nuclear attack. An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly, but by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to 140,000 as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. Media were barred from the museum for the length of the visit – amid speculation over whether the leaders would visit only the building’s east wing, which describes the dangers of nuclear war, or also pass through the main building, which contains photos of victims with horrific injuries. The group emerged from the museum after about 30 minutes and, led by Kishida and Biden, made the short walk to a cenotaph honouring the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the atomic bombing almost eight decades ago. Together, the leaders stepped forward to lay wreaths – given to them by local schoolchildren – on podiums in front of the memorial, with its eternal flame and plaque that reads: “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.” The burned-out shell of the A-bomb Dome, one of the few buildings to have survived the attack, could be seen in the distance. After a moment of silence, there was a group ceremony to plant a cherry blossom sapling, propagated from a tree that survived the atomic blast. The leaders later met a hibakusha survivor of the bombing. On a morning steeped in symbolism, this was the first time the leaders of G7 countries – including three that possess nuclear weapons – had visited the museum together. US officials said Biden, in a repeat of the approach taken by Obama, did not plan to issue an apology – a move that would go down badly in the US, where the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and, three days later, Nagasaki are seen as bringing the Pacific war to a quick end. But he and the other leaders viewed some of the museum’s harrowing exhibits, which included burned and ripped clothes, the charred contents of a child’s lunch box and strands of human hair from people who suffered exposure to radiation. Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, said agreements on the need to realise a world without nuclear weapons were among his goals during the three-day summit, which is expected to be dominated by the war in Ukraine and China’s growing military and economic might. “We will once again confirm our resolve to work for a world without nuclear weapons and we hope to transmit to the world our strong determination to protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law,” Kishida told reporters as he left for Hiroshima. “I hope that here in Hiroshima, the G7 and leaders from elsewhere will show their commitment to peace, which will be remembered in history.” In keeping with Kishida’s desire to place nuclear weapons high on the agenda, the summits final communique is expected to criticise Russia for threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Obama, who won the Nobel peace prize for his vision of a world without nuclear weapons, gave a speech at the peace park in 2016 and embraced a hibakusha survivor of the atomic bombing. But he spent only 10 minutes in the museum’s lobby, where he was shown a small number of symbolic exhibits. Kishida has tried to move nuclear disarmament up the agenda for this year’s summit and reportedly insisted G7 leaders visit not only peace memorials but also the museum. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” he said ahead of the visit to the peace museum. There is little enthusiasm for reducing nuclear stockpiles, however, at a time when Russia has issued thinly veiled threats to use them against Ukraine, and while North Korea is raising fears of a new nuclear test after a series of long-range missile launches."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jul/29/battery-power-how-china-could-take-charge-of-the-electric-vehicle-market","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T15:00:41Z","webTitle":"Battery power: how China could take charge of the electric vehicle market","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/29/battery-power-how-china-could-take-charge-of-the-electric-vehicle-market","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jul/29/battery-power-how-china-could-take-charge-of-the-electric-vehicle-market","fields":{"bodyText":"If you bought an electric vehicle in the UK this year, there’s a good chance it was an MG4.

Since 2007, the company has been owned, and the cars made, by SAIC, China’s largest carmaker. In the past few years, China has been churning out EVs of a quality and price that is making western marques nervous. More than a quarter of new cars sold in China last year were EVs or hybrids, compared with 13% globally. And of the 850,000 electric passenger cars imported to Europe in 2022, more than half came from China. Xi Jinping, China’s president, has pledged to take the country to net zero emissions by 2060. In the EU, the target is 2050. For both, decarbonising the streets with EVs will be crucial, and China is racing ahead. By 2025, 13% of China’s fleet is predicted to be fully electric or hybrid, compared with 6% globally. After an astonishing rise, some analysts are wondering if China’s EV industry can continue to accelerate, as the government winds down state support and geopolitical tensions threaten to dampen global demand for its cars. Last year, Beijing ended a programme of subsidies for EVs that had been in place for more than a decade. Between 2010 and 2020, more than 152bn yuan (£16.5bn) was ploughed into EV allowances. But rather than passing the higher costs on to consumers, companies slashed prices, leading to a price war that drove the cost of some models down by nearly 15% compared with 2022. In July, Beijing ordered the firms to show “core socialist values” and “not disrupt fair competition with abnormal pricing”. At the behest of the industry ministry, executives from 16 companies including Tesla and BYD – China’s leading brand and the world’s biggest EV producer – signed a pledge. But although the cash subsidies have has been wound down, China still wants to back an industry that will be crucial to meeting its climate targets – and which is expected to rake in £227bn this year. In June, the government announced a package of tax breaks for the industry worth 520bn yuan over four years. “Luck is opportunity and preparedness intersecting,” says Tu Le, the founder of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy. “China EV Inc and China battery Inc [have been] preparing for this since 2009.” China’s biggest EV success story is BYD, a Shenzhen-based company that started out making mobile phone batteries in 1995. In the 2000s it moved into cars, applying its cutting-edge battery knowledge to a market that had struggled to offer EVs cheaply enough to lure consumers away from petrol. After years as a relative minnow, BYD now makes what many analysts consider to be the most advanced car battery in the world: the Blade, which can be found in its EVs, as well as cars made by Tesla and Toyota. That innovation has translated into huge revenues: the company has forecast profit growth for the first six months of this year to be between 192% and 225%. At the lower end of the range, that would take profits to 10.5bn yuan. BYD’s success comes from the fact that it has near-total control over its supply chain, including the mining of minerals critical to battery production. Last year, the prices of lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese surged, causing havoc in the EV market. But BYD has cultivated close relationships with miners and processing companies. In April, it struck a deal with the Chilean government to build a $290m lithium cathode factory in the mineral-rich country. Other Chinese companies are making similar moves: UBS expects Chinese-controlled mines to produce almost a third of global lithium supply by 2025. China’s dominance of the supply chain is a headache for the west. In the finished products, some analysts warn that there is a security risk associated with having Chinese-made sensors roaming European streets. “Companies and policymakers have only just begun to think through the security ramifications of increasingly autonomous and sensor-filled automobiles operating on their roads,” says Chris Miller, author of Chip War, a book about the US-China semiconductor race. Beijing is alert to this concern. Teslas have repeatedly been banned from certain areas when China’s leaders are in town. Last week, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, was reportedly blocking Teslas from areas related to Xi’s planned visit for the University Games, a sports event that started on Friday. There is also the economic threat. In May, the insurer Allianz warned that Chinese-made EVs could cost European carmakers €7bn (£6bn) a year in lost profits by 2030. But the US and Europe are divided on how to balance these concerns against the desire to wean drivers off fossil fuels. European manufacturers – and particularly Germany’s premium marques of BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz – are heavily reliant on sales in China, and know that restricting China’s access to Europe could backfire. “It is going to be hard for European and UK politicians to square the circle that is the UK being committed to banning internal combustion engines by 2030 – and Europe by 2035 – without Chinese EVs,” says Le. “Something’s got to give.” Human rights groups hope that what gives is not their concerns about rights abuses in the EV supply chain. Researchers from Sheffield Hallam University have noted that much of China’s lithium processing takes place in Xinjiang, a predominantly Uyghur region where there are reports of forced labour (the Chinese government denies these claims). In “the rapidly growing lithium EV battery market, or in emerging technologies, companies will need to be vigilant to avoid forced labour supply chain risk” in Xinjiang, the researchers said in a report last year. But as economists from ING have noted, Chinese battery brands are “set to go global”. Batteries account for 40-60% of the price of an EV. So as EV companies compete to reduce costs, producing an affordable vehicle that is not powered by China may prove impossible."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jul/29/west-ham-transfer-power-struggle-david-moyes-tim-steidten","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T11:00:37Z","webTitle":"West Ham’s transfer power struggle leaves Moyes unable to get his men","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/29/west-ham-transfer-power-struggle-david-moyes-tim-steidten","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jul/29/west-ham-transfer-power-struggle-david-moyes-tim-steidten","fields":{"bodyText":"It was no secret that Declan Rice was going to leave West Ham this summer. They had ample time to prepare for their captain’s move to Arsenal. Replacements should have been lined up and a scramble to secure vital additions in central midfield before the season avoided. Yet the recruitment strategy at West Ham remains anything but smooth, even with Tim Steidten brought in as the technical director earlier this month. A scattergun process has slowed things down and the German’s appointment, far from ushering in a new era of collaboration, has confused matters. There is already talk of tension between Steidten and David Moyes, a manager who has always preferred to maintain control over signings, and in that context it is not a surprise to hear insiders describing the situation at West Ham as a mess. Admittedly the criticism jars when you remember that West Ham beat Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final last month. Yet that was Rice’s last game for the club and it is worth recalling that much of last season was spent battling against relegation. Moyes, who has faced complaints about his style of football from within the dressing room, probably would have gone had West Ham lost the final. As it is, the manager will feel his position has been strengthened by leading West Ham to their first trophy in 43 years. A safe pair of hands, the Scot has earned European qualification in three consecutive seasons. From Moyes’s perspective, now is the time for West Ham to adhere to his wishes. He has rejected many of Steidten’s suggestions and wants players with Premier League experience. There is a reluctance to repeat last year’s strategy of signing foreign players who will need to adjust to English football. Moyes wants solidity and that West Ham, who aim to replace Rice with two midfielders, have made offers for James Ward-Prowse, Conor Gallagher and Scott McTominay is an indication of who is picking the targets. There is a desire for a British core. West Ham have lost the leadership of Rice and Mark Noble in the past 12 months and other influential voices could be going; the striker Michail Antonio is wanted by Al-Ettifaq and the veteran left-back Aaron Cresswell is likely to join Wolves. The problem is that Steidten can be forgiven for wondering why he was hired. One of his picks is Monaco’s Youssouf Fofana, a 24-year-old France international, but Moyes is unsure. Fofana is likely to move elsewhere and Steidten, formerly of Bayer Leverkusen, is said to be frustrated. Some wonder whether he will last. Others suggest that Moyes, who has lost Mark Warburton and Paul Nevin from his backroom staff this summer, will go if West Ham start badly. These are uncertain times. Moyes has worked closely with Rob Newman, who was appointed as head of recruitment two years ago, but West Ham felt a change was necessary. They were unhappy with their transfer business under Moyes and Newman, whose position is under threat, while considering that Noble needs more support as in his role as sporting director. Yet the complication caused by hiring Steidten when the transfer window was open is best encapsulated by West Ham losing out to Newcastle in the race to sign Harvey Barnes from Leicester. West Ham had been working on the deal since April, but a reset after Steidten joined meant the opportunity to purchase a winger who would have been an upgrade on Moyes’s options on the left flank disappeared. So much for getting business done quickly. West Ham did well to get £105m for Rice, but losing their captain and best player is a blow and so far the response has been too reactive. Lodging bids for a variety of players all at once is not indicative of a clear strategy. Moves for Ajax’s Edson Álvarez and Fulham’s João Palhinha hit brick walls, and a mooted loan of Juventus’s Denis Zakaria has not progressed. As it stands, Moyes is going into the season with Conor Coventry, Flynn Downes, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paquetá to choose from in midfield. Of course much can change before West Ham visit Bournemouth in their season opener on 12 August. They are haggling with Southampton over Ward-Prowse, whose set-piece prowess would be invaluable in a Moyes side, and could send Downes to St Mary’s. There is room for negotiation with Chelsea over Gallagher and £45m could convince Manchester United to sell McTominay. Inevitably there will be those who see McTominay, Gallagher and Ward-Prowse as overpriced, unoriginal targets and question why West Ham are not looking for value in European leagues. Yet Moyes does not need to be imaginative; he needs wins. He will look through West Ham’s squad and see weaknesses. He wants a centre-back to provide cover for the injury-prone Kurt Zouma – the club had a £20m offer for Harry Maguire turned down – and will need a striker if Antonio and Gianluca Scamacca leave. West Ham, the only Premier League team still to sign anyone in this window, have to react. They are due to buy Carlos Borges from Manchester City for £14m but the winger is 19 and has not played first-team football. It is not enough. There is still too much dithering. The co-owner, David Sullivan, is in charge of negotiations and is not known for getting deals done quickly. Moyes, notoriously picky over signings, is not on the same page as Steidten. Put it all together and it hardly seems that West Ham have hit upon a winning formula. Once again they risk not being ready for the start of the season, and this time they cannot count on Rice to paper over the cracks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2023/jul/29/could-launch-of-sovereign-fund-make-kuwait-the-gulfs-next-football-power","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"Could launch of sovereign fund make Kuwait the Gulf’s next football power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/29/could-launch-of-sovereign-fund-make-kuwait-the-gulfs-next-football-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jul/29/could-launch-of-sovereign-fund-make-kuwait-the-gulfs-next-football-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Money flowing out of the Gulf region has changed the face of football. Fans in the United Arab Emirates have seen Manchester City become the best team in the world, supporters in Qatar have had the World Cup and counterparts in Saudi Arabia can scarcely believe what is going on with their clubs. Kuwait, another rich Gulf state, has been quiet but may be ready to stir from its sporting slumber. The country, which became independent from the United Kingdom in 1961, has a rich football history. Trevor Francis, who died this week, scored England’s only goal against Kuwait at the 1982 World Cup when the Blues, making their tournament debut long before their neighbours, arrived in Spain as Asian champions. Kuwait had also reached the quarter-finals of the Moscow Olympics two years previously, when they were beaten 2-1 by the Soviet Union. The game with England was a gentle affair compared with what happened against France when the president of Kuwait’s football federation, Sheikh Fahad al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, marched down to the Valladolid pitch to protest against a France goal after a whistle from inside the stadium caused his players to stop. It was a sensational intervention and the episode ended with the referee disallowing the strike, but France went on to restore the 4-1 scoreline and it was the last time Kuwait made an international impact. Now they have been overtaken on the pitch by Saudi Arabia, not unsurprisingly given the population and passion for football in that country, but also by Qatar and the UAE, states of similar sizes. These neighbours, especially those from Riyadh, have been spending billions and sending shockwaves through sport. Kuwait has comparable riches and the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world. The Kuwait Investment Authority, set up in 1953, is also one of the biggest with $800bn to call upon, according to sovereign wealth fund tracker Global SWF. This is $100bn more than the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia which owns four of the country’s biggest clubs and Newcastle United as well as much of golf. Having the financial muscle is one thing; in Kuwait, using it is another because of the political situation. In Riyadh or Doha, leaders can drive through plans but political battles between the ruling family of Kuwait and the powerful, in regional terms, national assembly makes it hard to get anything done. Divisions and infighting within the family don’t help and it has led to political gridlock and a lack of much-needed reforms in many sectors, with sport not regarded as a priority. Talk to officials and they refer to the 1990 invasion at the hands of Iraq as another issue. Before Saddam Hussein sent his tanks across the border, Kuwait had been a vocal and proud exponent of Arab unity. Since, the country has been more hesitant to step forward into the international spotlight. The times could be changing, however, with news that Kuwait wants to launch a sovereign fund called the Ciyada Development Fund. A government document said it would “accelerate the growth of the Kuwaiti economy, improve the quality of life and bolster transformation and progress in the various fields of development through strategic planning and effective implementation of major development projects”. It is the kind of language that has been seen and heard elsewhere in the region. A feasibility study is expected in the next few months. It is not yet expected that Kuwaiti clubs will start bidding with Al-Hilal, Al-Nassr, Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli for players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé, Karim Benzema or Riyad Mahrez. That really would be putting the cart before the horse because the local league has declined in parallel with the national team. Proud clubs such as Al-Qadsia and Al-Kuwait have trophy cabinets as full as those of their neighbours but have fallen behind on and especially off the pitch. Stadiums and training facilities don’t match up to those in Riyadh, Doha and Abu Dhabi. A Fifa ban in 2015, for government interference in the running of the game, lasted for two years and hit the football scene hard, leading to less grassroots investment. Kuwait have not qualified for the next Asian Cup, which will take place in Qatar, after losing at home to Indonesia. A new fund that considers sport is likely to regard hosting international events as more of a priority than bringing in big stars or buying overseas clubs. For Kuwait, it is more important to raise the country’s profile, improve the sporting infrastructure and give some life to a run-down industry. The foundations need a lot of care but, with the money potentially available, it may not be too long before Kuwait starts making its presence felt in a busy and crowded neighbourhood."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T17:15:30Z","webTitle":"We need more honesty on nuclear power’s long legacy of hazardous waste | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","fields":{"bodyText":"Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (The long read, 15 December). As Britain and other states with nuclear power industries grapple with how to go about an effective, safe and economical nuclear clean-up, it might be better to explain the challenges with less reliance on suggestions that in its early days the nuclear industry never thought about decommissioning (though the point has validity). Instead, we need more honesty about the fact that nuclear power inescapably generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste, the worst of which will remain hazardous probably beyond Homo sapiens’ time on the planet. The industry’s solution to this is a network of deep disposal facilities. But none have yet been created, their cost is enormous and there is no certainty that they will perform the long-term task required of them. These are considerations that sadly receive little attention in current debates about the need for new nuclear-generation capacity. Coincidentally, you published a letter (14 December) suggesting that nuclear radiation is less dangerous than emissions from a wood-burning stove, a curious comparison to make. Wood-burning stoves are pollutants, no question, but they could never lead to a Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chornobyl or Fukushima. Nor will decommissioning them cost billions and take decades. Tom Smith Chair, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, 2017-20 • In 1993, a government official told me that “it was sometimes right to do the wrong thing”. For reasons of political expediency, it was right to give political consent for the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. This huge facility, not mentioned in Samanth Subramanian’s fine long read, had been built over the previous decade to reprocess British and foreign, especially Japanese, spent nuclear fuels. Abandoning it would be too embarrassing for the many politicians and their parties that had backed it, expensive in terms of compensation for broken contracts, and damaging to Britain’s and the nuclear industry’s international reputation. It was wrong to proceed, as the government well knew, because the primary justification for its construction – supply of plutonium for fast breeder reactors (FBRs) – had been swept away by the abandonment of FBRs in the 1980s (none were built anywhere). Because returning Thorp’s separated plutonium and radwaste to Japan would be difficult and risky. Because decommissioning Thorp would become much more costly after its radioactive contamination. Because there was a known win-win solution, favoured by most utilities – store the spent fuel safely at Sellafield prior to its return to senders, avoiding the many troubles that lay ahead. Thorp operated fitfully until its closure in 2018. The 30 tonnes of plutonium that it separated remains at Sellafield – another waste to trouble generations to come. William Walker Edinburgh • Anton van der Merwe makes the compelling point that lack of investment in nuclear power over the last 40 years has had a disastrous impact on carbon emissions and therefore has exacerbated the climate emergency (Letters, 14 December). However, in the same issue, the long read discusses plans for new nuclear without mentioning the huge beneficial impact that low-carbon nuclear will need to have if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C temperature rises published in 2018 presented mitigation scenarios in which nuclear generation would grow on average 2.5 times from today’s level by 2050. Without this, the chances of meeting climate targets are much reduced. Neil Smith Solihull, West Midlands • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as “very dangerous” and very unstable. He said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, adding that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first Brotosj Challenger 2 main battle tanks have arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, the country’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of “aggression” against Ukraine, officials said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, “in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. Belarus’s foreign ministry has justified its decision to allow Russia to station nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Minsk had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security, it said, according to Russian news agency Tass. Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki added. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight and that his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision is “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. The US has not seen any indications that Russia is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby has said. It comes after Vladimir Putin announced on Saturday that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Speaking to reporters today, Kirby said: We’re watching this as best we can. We haven’t seen any movement by Mr Putin to act on what he pledged he would do. The Belarusian foreign ministry today confirmed it will host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Donetsk regional police have published footage showing scenes of devastation in Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka. The video shows destroyed residential blocks with charred walls and piles of rubble on deserted streets as police continue to evacuate civilians. Starting on Sunday, the city will begin to shut off its utilities as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, its military administration head. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of “aggression” against Ukraine, officials said. A US state department spokesperson said: We believe that this Special Tribunal should be rooted in Ukraine’s domestic judicial system, as this will provide the clearest path to establishing a new Tribunal and maximize our chances of achieving meaningful accountability. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak also announced Washington’s support for such a court in a speech on Monday night. She said: At this critical moment in history, I am pleased to announce that the United States supports the development of an internationalised tribunal dedicated to prosecuting the crime of aggression against Ukraine. She said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, \"in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. Ukraine, the EU and the Netherlands have publicly backed the idea of a special tribunal. Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation,” has denied accusations of war crimes including deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilians. Here’s some reaction to the IOC’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes be allowed to compete under a neutral flag in international sporting events. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision is “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”, posting to Twitter: I would have liked the Russian and Belarusian athletes to remain excluded. There is no reason whatsoever for Russia to return to world sport. Wladimir Klitschko, the Ukrainian former professional boxer, accused IOC president Thomas Bach of serving “the colours and interests of Russia”. Poland’s deputy foreign minister, Piotr Wawrzyk, said it was “a day of shame for the IOC”, posting to Twitter: What positive things has Russia done for their athletes to now take part in competitions!! After Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel!! After the daily bombings of civilian sites!! A 200-year-old bronze statue commemorating Nelson’s victory at the Battle of Trafalgar is to be surrounded by thousands of sandbags to echo the plight of monuments in Ukraine. The plan for Liverpool’s Nelson’s Monument is one of 24 cultural commissions announced on Tuesday as part of a festival that aims to transform the city in the run-up to its staging of the Eurovision song contest. Running from 1-14 May, it will, say the organisers, be “the pre-party to end all pre-parties” as fans from across the world descend on the city. Claire McColgan, the director of Culture Liverpool, said the planned EuroFestival would be a “scouse/Ukrainian mashup of brilliance”. She added: No other Eurovision host city has ever curated a creative programme of such scale and scope. This is the spirit of Eurovision spilling on to our streets. Free for all. Accessible to all. Uniting us all. Read the full story here: The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. The IOC issued a set of recommendations, which stated that those “with a Russian or a Belarusian passport must compete only as Individual Neutral Athletes”, meaning individuals can compete without national symbols, such as a flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. It added that “athletes who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies” could also not be considered. IOC president Thomas Bach, speaking at a news conference today, said: What is maybe most important, what has changed, is that participation of athletes with Russian and Belarusian passports in competitions and in international competitions, works. The US will not provide Russia with data on its nuclear forces, the White House has said, following Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend Moscow’s participation in the New Start nuclear arms treaty. The 2010 agreement, which limited the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy, was the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia. Putin announced its suspension in February, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Moscow in Ukraine. A spokesperson for the US national security council said today: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start Treaty by taking proportionate and reversable countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. They added: That means that because Russia’s claimed suspension of the New Start Treaty is legally invalid, the US is legally permitted to withhold our biannual data update in response to Russia’s breaches. The US has previously said Moscow’s decision to suspend its participation in the treaty showed it was not a responsible nuclear partner. Russia and the US together hold 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has described the situation at Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine as “very dangerous” and very unstable. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi, who yesterday met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the Dnipro hydroelectric power station, northeast of the Zaporizhzhia plant, said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. He was speaking a day before he is expected to travel to the nuclear plant, the largest in Europe. Grossi has been pushing for a safety zone to be created at the plant to prevent a possible nuclear disaster as Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site of the power station. Kyiv does not want a deal that will in effect recognise or allow a Russian military presence at the plant. Grossi added: I am confident that it might be possible to establish some form of protection, perhaps not emphasising so much the idea of a zone, but on the protection itself: what people should do, or shouldn’t do to protect (the plant) instead of having a territorial concept. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. Higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka “potentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the area”, according to the Institute for Study of War (ISW). The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help “explain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past week”. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Sloviansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first Brotosj Challenger 2 main battle tanks have arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, the country’s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. Belarus’s foreign ministry has justified its decision to allow Russia to station nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Minsk had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security, it said, according to Russian news agency Tass. Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki added. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight and that his whereabouts were unknown. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here with all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Earlier we reported that a Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine had reportedly been sentenced to two years in prison. It appears that the whereabouts of the convicted man, Alexei Moskalyov, is unclear. Court officials have said the 54-year-old fled house arrest overnight, and was not present for the outcome of his trial. He had been wearing a bracelet that tracked his movements but apparently had taken it off. Moskalyov’s lawyer, Vladimir Biliyenko, told reporters after the hearing today that he learned of his client’s disappearance at the court hearing. He said he had not seen his client since Monday and did not know whether Moskalyov had fled. He told Reuters: At the moment, to be honest, I’m in a state of shock. He said the defence would appeal against the court’s verdict and that Moskalyov’s daughter, Maria, would remain in a state-run shelter for the time being. While the panel discussion continues in Washington DC, where France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna , and the Czech Republic’s foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, have also spoken, Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who was due to appear, has posted to Telegram. He has said he has visited Sumy, posting: Sumy region. Our border. [I] observed the service of the border guards holding the frontiers of the state. Ukrainian border guards work in close cooperation with other components of the defence forces of Ukraine to protect the state border from the enemy. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, has been addressing a summit on democracy in Washington DC, and has been outlining again Ukraine’s peace plan. The key points he has made so far include saying: Although Russia seeks to destroy Ukraine, its aggression is not only about Ukraine. Russia also aims to destroy the world order based on international law and the UN Charter. Our sons and daughters have not only been fighting for the future, but also defending our common democratic values at the cost of their lives. In this fight, we are defending the entire democratic world. No other nation wants peace more than Ukraine. But peace at any cost is an illusion. I would like to emphasise that the Ukrainian people will accept peace only if it guarantees the cessation of Russian aggression in full the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of our state’s territorial integrity within internationally recognised borders. He went on to say later: “I want to be clear, Russia has to withdraw from every square metre of Ukrainian territory. There should be no misinterpretation of what the word withdrawal implies.” Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, responded by saying that calls for a ceasefire were appealing – “who wouldn’t want the guns to be silent” – but risked freezing the conflict and allowing Russia to consolidate its territorial gains at Ukraine’s expense. In his opening address in Washington DC, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken has restated the US position on potential future peace in Ukraine. He said: The US is committed to supporting meaningful diplomatic efforts that can achieve this. We all know that for peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and for peace to be durable. It must ensure that Russia can’t simply rest and refit its troops, and then relaunch the war at a time more advantageous to it. Ukraine under president Zelenskiy has put forward a proposal that would force such a peace. It would end the war and save countless lives. It would restore Ukraine’s territory, and respect its democracy, would reconstruct the country and the economy. It would ensure that radiation and nuclear safety. It would uphold the UN Charter and the will of the international community. And it would come to the aid of billions around the world that have been affected by Russia’s aggression. There’s been a change of plan at the summit, and Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has appeared, carrying Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s apologies, saying that you will have seen in the news that Ukraine’s president is visiting frontline regions in Ukraine. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken is chairing an event entitled “A Just and Lasting Peace in Ukraine”, and the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to join the event virtually. It is part of a summit for democracy event being held in Washington DC. You will be able to watch a live stream on this blog. You may need to refresh the page for the play button to appear. The session is just starting. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus will certainly face further EU sanctions resulting from Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. The Belarusian foreign ministry justified its decision to cooperate with Russia in a statement today, saying Minsk was acting to protect itself after years of pressure from the US and its allies aimed at changing its political and geopolitical direction. Morawiecki, at a news conference in Bucharest, said: This step taken by Russia... the announcement of the deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus, will certainly lead to the announcement of additional sanctions, the level of sanctions will be much more severe for the Lukashenko regime. The US has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”. Aa senior Biden administration official has said there were no signs Moscow planned to use its nuclear weapons. Morawiecki said he was in daily talks with other EU leaders about an 11th package of sanctions against Russia and that it would include more measures targeting Belarus. In February, Poland announced it would close a key border crossing with Belarus amid rising tensions after a journalist of Polish origin was sentenced to eight years in prison by a Belarusian court in a trial Warsaw says was politically motivated. Poland was considering further limitations on cross-border traffic, Morawiecki said today. He added: We border Belarus and, as part of our bilateral relations, we are considering tightening the parameters of passenger and freight traffic in order to send a signal that we do not accept actions that serve Russia in its aggressive actions in Ukraine. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was convicted on Tuesday of discrediting the armed forces, the OVD-Info rights group said. He has been separated from his daughter, Maria, since he was placed under house arrest and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Moskalyov was convicted over comments he had posted online about the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. But the investigation last April when Maria, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said: “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. Moskalyov was subsequently fined about £350 for a post online in which he characterised the Russian army as “rapists”. The remarks came since revelations of alleged war crimes committed against civilians at Bucha in Ukraine. The case has provoked an outcry among Russian human rights activists and sparked an online campaign to reunite the father and daughter. The banned rights group Memorial said it considered Moskalyov to be a political prisoner. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Ukraine’s northern Sumy region during his tour of areas of the country that have borne the brunt of Russia’s invasion. Zelenskiy met officials and local residents in the city of Okhtyrka, which had fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was occupied by Russian forces for a month and liberated in March 2022, Associated Press reports. During the past seven days, the Ukrainian leader has visited the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from Russia, to the frontline area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south. Addressing a crowd of people on a square in Okhtyrka, he promised that the city would be rebuilt. Zelenskiy said: We won’t let any wound remain on the body of our state. In Trostianets, Zelensky honoured soldiers at the local railway station, where Ukrainian authorities say the Russians tortured prisoners. One resident told the AP that the president’s visit to the city meant a lot to him, adding: It’s a symbol of unity and the iron will that brought the country together. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. About 2,000 civilians remain in Avdiivka, a Donetsk region city about 90km (56 miles) south-west of the besieged Bakhmut, according to officials. The city had a prewar population of more than 30,000. Starting on Sunday, the city’s utilities will begin to be shut off as “more and more of the town is shelled and destroyed daily,” said Vitaliy Barabash, the city’s military administration head. He added: The town is being wiped off the face of the Earth. Barabash, in a Telegram post yesterday, said Russian forces were turning Avdiivka into “a place from post-apocalyptic movies”. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. After months of prevaricating, the German government announced in late January it would provide Kyiv with the state-of-the-art fighting vehicles as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. Berlin had promised 14 vehicles but increased that to 18 in order to make up the numbers of a Ukrainian battalion, with Portugal contributing three tanks and Sweden 10. Poland has supplied Ukraine with a battalion of the older Leopard 2 A4 model. “As promised, our tanks have arrived on time in the hands of our Ukrainian friends”, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, said on Monday night. “I am sure that they can make the difference on the front.” The vehicles were handed over at the Ukrainian border at the end of last week, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported, adding that 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and two tank recovery vehicles promised by Berlin have also arrived in Ukraine. For security reasons, the German government would not comment on the route by which the tanks were delivered. Kyiv, which had a limited numbers of tanks from the Soviet or post-Soviet era, has said it urgently needs heavier armour for its defence against Russia’s invasion, with the German-made Kampfpanzer Leopard 2 at the top of its list. Read the full story here: One evening in late December, as Muscovites strolled along their city’s brightly lit streets in anticipation of the end-of-year celebrations, a group of old friends gathered for dinner at the flat of a senior state official. Some of the guests present, which included members of Russia’s cultural and political elite, toasted a new year in which they expressed hope for peace and a return to normality. As the night went on, a man who needed little introduction stood up for a toast, holding his glass. “I am guessing you are expecting me to say something,” said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s longtime spokesperson, according to one of the two people who separately recounted the evening to the Guardian under conditions of anonymity. “Things will get much harder. This will take a very, very long time,” Peskov continued. His toast darkened the mood of the evening among the guests, many of whom have said in private that they oppose the war in Ukraine. One guest said: It was uncomfortable to hear his speech. It was clear that he was warning that the war will stay with us and we should prepare for the long haul. Read the full story by my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth: Nearly 4,400 Ukrainian orphans and children are held “deprived of parental care” in Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. Vereshchuk accused Russia of concealing information about the children, and said Kyiv had deployed a wide range of government agencies to supply evidence to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin and his children’s rights commissioner, Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children. She added: There’s already enough evidence. We hope our efforts and pressure from the international community will speed up the process of returning our children. The UK and Poland will build two temporary villages in western and central Ukraine to provide housing for people who have been forced from their homes by Russia’s invasion, the UK government has said. The villages in Lviv and Poltava will offer accommodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, a fraction of the millions either displaced in Ukraine or who have fled the country since the war began more than a year ago. The UK has announced up to £10m in funding to support the partnership, which will deliver temporary shelters, energy supplies and assistance to those who have fled heavy fighting on the frontlines or lost their homes because of Russian shelling. In a statement, the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said: For the past year, Putin has continued to target civilian homes and infrastructure, with the Ukrainian people paying a heavy price. This new UK-Poland partnership will help bring light, heat and homes to those most in need. The international community is resolute in our shared determination to support the Ukrainian people and see them prevail with a just peace on Ukrainian terms. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the news wires of the aftermath of recent shelling in the Russian-controlled parts of the Donetsk region. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. Several explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties. Kyiv air defence said it shot down all drones involved. A cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses, were hit in the border village of Chernatske in Sumy, while a hospital was struck in the Dnipro district of Kherson. Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, posted a video thanking the UK for the first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks to arrive in Ukraine. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” he wrote on Twitter. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap Ukrainian imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would keep demanding an international investigation into explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea last year, after failing to win United Nations backing for an investigation. Reuters reports that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in his regular daily media briefing that everyone should be interested in an impartial investigation in order to find the culprits. On Monday, Russia failed to get the UN security council to ask for an independent inquiry into explosions in September that ruptured the Nord Stream gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany and spewed gas into the Baltic Sea. Romania and Poland are in talks with the European Commission over export tracing mechanisms for Ukrainian grain to ensure local farmers are not hurt by a flood of cheap imports, the Polish and Romanian prime ministers said on Tuesday. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has had its Black Sea ports blocked since Russia invaded more than a year ago and has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through EU states Poland and Romania. But Reuters reports that logistical bottlenecks mean that large quantities of Ukrainian grain, which is cheaper than that produced in the European Union, has ended up in central European states, hurting prices and sales of local farmers. Romanian and Polish prime ministers Nicolae Ciucă and Mateusz Morawiecki told a business conference in Bucharest their governments were working on solutions with the EU. Oleksii Reznikov, the Ukrainian defence minister, gave the UK the thumbs up as he took a ride in what he said was the first British Challenger 2 main battle tank to arrive in Ukraine. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine, which is preparing for a possible counteroffensive against Russian forces that invaded 13 months ago. Reuters reports Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. “It was a pleasure to take the first Ukrainian Challenger 2 MBT [main battle tank] for a spin,” Reznikov wrote. “These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions.” In the video, he gave the thumbs up sign and thanked British defence secretary Ben Wallace for the tanks. “Marvellous, Ben,” he said in English. “It’s … very good stuff. Thank you very much from Ukraine to the United Kingdom.” Possible drone attacks against vital energy infrastructure are a serious threat to Russia’s energy security, energy minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday. Reuters reports Shulginov did not mention Ukraine by name, but Russia says it has foiled a number of attempted Ukrainian drone attacks in recent months. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia, but senior officials in Kyiv have on occasion appeared to welcome the news of successful drone attacks on Russian soil. “The key threat now is acts of illegal interference through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles,” Shulginov said during a roundtable discussion where he addressed the security of Russia’s energy facilities. He said he was cooperating with Russia’s defence ministry and FSB security service on the issue. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces said in a video posted on Tuesday. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Moscow sees capturing Bakhmut as vital in its efforts to establish complete control over the Donbas industrial region in eastern Ukraine. “They do not stop trying to surround and capture the city,” Reuters report Syrskyi said in the video posted on the Telegram messaging app. “As of today, our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on them. It will create the necessary conditions to help liberate Ukrainian land and speed up our victory.” Bakhmut had a prewar population of about 70,000 people but the city has been virtually destroyed in about eight months of intense fighting, often at close quarters. Syrskyi has been meeting troops near the frontline as Ukraine prepares for a possible counteroffensive after 13 months of war. He said on Monday the defence of Bakhmut was a military necessity. Syrskyi said his visits to meet troops near the frontline were needed for him and his commanders to agree on plans that would have “real results on the battlefield but not on the maps”. Alexander Novak, the Russian deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday that Russia needed to focus on boosting energy exports to so-called “friendly” countries, as he said Russian oil supplies to India jumped 22-fold last year. Reuters reports Novak said energy revenues accounted for 42% of Russia’s federal budget in 2022 and said the country’s energy industry was sustainable, despite the challenges faced by western sanctions. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that a hospital in Kherson has been struck overnight. Citing officials from the local administration, it writes: Around 4 o’clock in the morning, Russian troops shelled a hospital in the Dnipro district of Kherson. There were at least five explosions. One of the shells hit the fifth floor of the building. The blast wave knocked out almost all the windows in the main building on one side. The claims have not been independently verified. Belarus’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it had been forced to house Russian nuclear weapons on its territory by the aggressive actions of Nato countries that were threatening Belarus’s own security, Reuters reports, citing Russian news agency Tass. Minsk also said the plans – announced over the weekend by Vladimir Putin – to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, would not contravene international non-proliferation agreements as Belarus would not have control over the weapons. Tass quotes the ministry saying: Military cooperation between Belarus and Russia is carried out in strict accordance with international law. The training of Belarusian pilots capable of flying aircraft with specific ammunition, the modernisation of such aircraft, as well as the deployment of nuclear warheads on the territory of Belarus without transferring control over them to Minsk, as well as access to appropriate technology, do not in any way contradict the provisions of articles I and II of the non-proliferation treaty. The ministry said it was forced to respond because “unilateral coercive measures in politics and the economy are accompanied by the buildup of military potential in the territory of neighboring countries – Nato members in close proximity to our borders. Considering these circumstances and the legitimate concerns and risks in the field of national security arising from them, Belarus is taking forced response actions to strengthen its own security and defence capability.” It also noted that Belarus regards the actions of the west as “direct and gross interference in the internal affairs of an independent state, aimed at changing the geopolitical course and changing the internal political system of Belarus”. State-owned Russian news agency Tass is reporting this morning some words from Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, about the situation in Bakhmut. Tass quotes Pushilin on the Soloviev Live TV channel on Tuesday saying: Now [Wagner mercenary group troops] have created unbearable conditions for the enemy to even carefully try to bring up combat kits, bring up reserves, take out even the wounded – all this is extremely difficult for the enemy, because all the roads are already being shot through by [Wagner mercenary troops]. As for the city itself, here it was important to clean up the industrial zone at the Azom plant itself. Pretty much we can already talk about this, the guys there are finishing off the militants, but those are single groups. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian state media has previously reported that Wagner forces were in full control of the Azom metallurgical plant in the north of the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports on its official Telegram channel that this morning the border village of Chernatske in Sumy oblast has been struck. It writes: “Twenty hits were recorded, probably from barrel artillery. The infrastructure of the village was damaged – a cultural centre and a children’s playground, as well as five private houses.” The UK Ministry of Defence says Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south. It said the regiment belonged to the 3rd Army Corps, the first major new formation Russia stood up to support its invasion since August 2022 and despite a period of training in Belarus, the formation “appears to display limited combat effectiveness”. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian forces launched 24 airstrikes, 12 missile strikes and carried out 55 attacks from rocket salvo systems in the last 24 hours, according the latest update from the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine. A missile strike in the city of Slovyansk damaged high-rise buildings and private houses, causing deaths and injuries among civilians – although numbers were not immediately available. A separate airstrike in the city of Bersyslav also caused damaged to civilian infrastructure. According to the update, Russian forces also carried out attacks with 15 Shahed-136 type strike UAVs. 14 of them were destroyed by our defenders. In the same period, the Ukrainian air force carried out nine strikes against Russian forces and one attack on an anti-aircraft missile complex. Ukrainian solders also shot down five reconnaissance drones of various types. Rocket forces and artillery also struck three control points and areas of concentration, an artillery unit in firing position, an ammunition warehouse, a fuel warehouse and “two more important targets”. The claims have not been independently verified. The German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, confirmed the arrival of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks in Ukraine on Monday. In a post to Twitter, Pistorius said he believed the tanks would make a “crucial difference at the front”. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. Britain’s Challenger tanks have arrived in Ukraine, a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Kyiv said on Monday. Spokesperson for the Ukrainian ministry of defence, Iryna Zolotar, told the AFP that the tanks had been received. They are in Ukraine already. No further details were provided. The tanks are expected to be involved in any spring counter-offensive launched by Ukraine. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, said earlier on Monday he inspected a “new addition” to the country’s forces – Challenger tanks as well as Germany’s Marder infantry fighting vehicles, plus Cougar armoured trucks and Stryker armoured personnel carriers from the US. A year ago, no one would have thought that our partners’ support would be so strong. The ISW also said higher quality Wagner units have likely been committed to fighting around Avdiivka “potentially to reinforce recent limited tactical successes in the area”. The ISW said the deployments appear intended to help support weaker units from the Donetsk People’s Republic and that if confirmed, their involvement may help “explain the limited tactical gains made in the area over the past week”. The Institute for Study of War (ISW) says it has been monitoring chattering among Russian military bloggers about the dismissal of Russian military commanders overseeing troops in combat zones. Rumours have been circulating that Rusam Muradov has been dismissed as Eastern Military District Commander, and Yevgeny Nikiforov has been replaced as Western Military District Commander. The ISW could not confirm either change in leadership but said it was, “noteworthy that Russian millbloggers are discussing potential dismissals of commanders associated with areas of operation in which Russian forces have been largelyunable to secure substantial gains or have suffered major losses”. The UN security council on Monday declined a Russian request to investigate the blasts on the pipelines that move natural gas from Russia to Europe under the Baltic Sea. Russia, China and Brazil voted in favour of the Russian request, but other security council members abstained or said another investigation was unnecessary. For a resolution to be adopted by the security council, it needs a minimum of nine “yes” votes in the 15-member council, and no veto by one of the permanent members – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. The US deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, said there was no need for a UN investigation when inquiries by Sweden, Denmark and Germany “are proceeding in a comprehensive, transparent and impartial manner”. It was an attempt to discredit the work of ongoing national investigations and prejudice any conclusions they reached that do not comport to Russia’s predetermined and political narrative. It was not an attempt to seek the truth. The pipelines, known as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, are majority-owned by Russia’s state-run energy giant Gazprom. Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The explosions on both occurred on 26 September. The investigations by European nations have yet to yield conclusive results, at least none made public. AP Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Multiple explosions were reported in Kyiv on Monday night following a drone attack, according to the mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko. Klitschko said a shop caught fire in the west but there were no immediate reports of casualties with Kyiv air defence reporting it had shot down all 13 Russian drones involved in the attack. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president has told IAEA head, Rafael Grossi, that safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility could not be guaranteed until Russian troops left. Zelenskiy also “visited advanced positions” in the Zaporizhzhia region on Monday. The pair met to discuss the management of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant where Zelenskiy told him he could not guarantee the security of the facility so long as the area remained occupied by Russian troops. British challenger tanks are “in Ukraine already” according to Ukrainian defence minister Iryna Zolotar, no further details provided AFP reports. The arrival of the tanks follow the delivery of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks provided by Germany on Monday along with 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles. In other developments: Zelenskiy also spoke with the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda to discuss the ongoing war and “current defense needs of Ukraine and joint diplomatic efforts for the near future”. Russian navy vessels have fired supersonic anti-ship missiles at a mock target in the Sea of Japan. The Russian defence ministry reported the exercises on Tuesday, saying “the target, located at a distance of about 100 kilometres, was successfully hit by a direct hit from two Moskit cruise missiles.” Ukraine’s ground forces commander said his troops were continuing to repel heavy Russian attacks on the eastern city of Bakhmut and that defending it was a “military necessity”. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi’s comments signalled again Ukraine’s intention to keep fighting in Bakhmut despite the heavy death toll. At least two people were killed in a Russian missile strike in the eastern city of Sloviansk on Monday, according to the regional governor. The attack left 29 others wounded, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, adding that a number of high-rise buildings and offices were damaged or destroyed. Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a video clip that showed vehicles on fire and debris strewn across the road. Western companies selling their Russian businesses and leaving face a compulsory 10% direct donation to the government, the Financial Times has reported, after a ruling by Russia’s foreign investments commission. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament, Ruslan Stefanchuk, has told British lawmakers that Kyiv is ready to send its pilots to be trained in the use of western fighter jets. Stefanchuk, speaking during a visit to the UK, said Kyiv could bring “joint victory for Ukraine and the world” once it “gets the wings”, in language echoing that of Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s speech to the British parliament in February. A leaked phone conversation allegedly between prominent Russian music producer Iosif Prigozhin and billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, in which the two men give a far-ranging criticism of the war in Ukraine and Russia’s leadership, has been published by Ukrainian media. If genuine, the audio would provide a rare insight into the mood within the Russian elites. Russian and Belarusian athletes should be banned from the 2024 Olympics in Paris unless Moscow pulls its forces out of Ukraine, Poland has said, after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it planned to let them compete as neutrals. Poland has detained a foreign citizen on charges of spying for Russia, prosecutors have said. The arrest comes after Poland dismantled a Russian espionage network that had been preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. If found guilty, the suspect could face up to 10 years in prison. Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Finland to join Nato, bringing it one step closer to becoming a full member of the alliance. Hungarian lawmakers voted 182 for and six against with no abstentions. Turkey is the only one of Nato’s 30 members not to have ratified Finland’s accession."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T10:00:36Z","webTitle":"Trump-era officials under fire as nuclear fund for Bikini islanders is squandered","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/05/bikini-atoll-nuclear-fund-interior-department","fields":{"bodyText":"Former staff have lashed the US Department of the Interior for failing to predict that a 2017 decision to lift oversight from a $59m trust fund for Pacific Islanders displaced by American nuclear testing would lead to the fund’s exhaustion through mismanagement and alleged fraud. Tom Bussanich, who in 2017 was a senior official in the department’s Office of Insular Affairs, said that he “would have bet money that there would have been issues with the trust fund and that the money would have been wasted”. Allen Stayman, a former director of the Office of Insular Affairs, dismissed the office as “the agency of acquiescence”. Meanwhile, confidential bank documents reviewed by the Guardian reveal red flags that could have alerted the department to potential issues had it been scrutinising the fund, including the transfer of millions of dollars to two personal checking accounts over which the fund’s trustees had no oversight. Together, the criticism and confidential documents are likely to increase the pressure the interior department faces for its role in the fund’s exhaustion, which left thousands of nuclear survivors and their descendants bereft. The US government established the fund in the 1980s to support displaced residents of Bikini Atoll, a small reef in the Pacific nation of the Marshall Islands which the US left uninhabitable after it tested 23 nuclear weapons there between 1946 and 1958. Until recently, the fund provided several million dollars each year to a council that oversaw the displaced Bikinians, helping to provide housing, food and education in a country where the median income is $9,600 and almost half of households skip meals due to lack of money. In 2016, however, Anderson Jibas was elected mayor of the Bikinian council and began pushing the interior department to hand over control of the fund. In 2017, Douglas Domenech, who Donald Trump had appointed as assistant interior secretary, announced that the department would hand over control of the fund, which by then held $59m, to “restore trust and ensure that sovereignty means something”. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that the fund had been whittled down to about $100,000, largely through extravagant spending by Jibas on projects including land development in Hawaii, new ships and planes, and an apartment complex in the Marshall Islands. Annual bank statements reviewed by the Guardian show that some of the money was disbursed directly from the trust fund to the vendors with whom Jibas and other local officials were negotiating. Because those disbursements were direct, they allowed the fund’s trustees to exercise a measure of oversight. But the statements also show that Jibas and the council’s American lawyer, Gordon Benjamin, instructed trustees to disburse large sums of money to a Bank of Guam checking account that they said was being used for “council operations” but which the trustees could not scrutinise. In 2019, for example, Jibas and Benjamin instructed trustees to disburse $15.36m to the Bank of Guam account. When asked about the Bank of Guam account, Jibas said in a written statement that he had “no idea what you are talking about”. The Guardian also reviewed correspondence between Benjamin and the trustees and found cases of controversial spending. In March 2019, for example, Benjamin wrote that, “Since early February, a team of [Bikinian] Council, an engineer, two contractors, and I have been on an active search for an airplane for KBE Tourism. Payments to at least one of the contractors, plus travel expenses and per diems etc. has begun to mount as travel has taken the team to Europe and Asia in search of an airplane.” Benjamin said the team was travelling to Papua New Guinea and “needs $250,000 immediately” to be disbursed from the fund to the Bank of Guam account to cover travel expenses and a partial deposit on a potential plane. Also in 2019, Benjamin instructed the trustees to send $50,000 directly to Jibas’s Bank of Hawaii personal savings account. Benjamin explained that the money was part of a council-approved “representation package” to pay for “meetings with contractors, consultants, U.S. Government and Marshall Islands’ Government and Local Government representatives”. Benjamin did not respond to questions about the spending. Some of Jibas and Benjamin’s early instructions to the trustees included the signatures of a majority of the Bikinian council. Later, the process was changed so that disbursements could be made without evidence that they had been approved by the wider council. Jibas said this change was made by the trustees. The release of large sums to checking accounts that trustees could not scrutinise might have attracted concern from American officials, but by then the interior department was no longer receiving information about the fund from the Bikinian council or bank officials. The department declined to comment on the bank documents. From 2018, Jibas refused to provide the council’s financial documents to the Marshallese auditor-general, forcing Marshallese police to forcibly seize the documents in 2021. In an interview with the New York Times, Jibas admitted he occasionally used money from the fund to pay for personal items. Jibas told the Guardian that he had also directed between $200,000 and $250,000 from the fund towards the construction of a two-story house for his personal use. He claimed this project had been approved by the Bikinian council. Stayman, the former director of the Office of Insular Affairs, said the interior department had withdrawn oversight despite the risk of fraud because it did not want to anger local officials. “The position of many officials behind the scenes has historically been that Interior shouldn’t have oversight, because if we have oversight, then we’re going to have disagreements with the islands, and we can’t handle disagreements,” Stayman said. The department declined to comment on the criticisms. Last week, following protests by Bikinians angered by the New York Times’s revelations, the Marshallese government temporarily placed the Bikinian council’s finances in the care of the national ministry of finance. In contrast, accountability in America seems less likely. An official familiar with the situation said the department was “hoping to contain the story” and “circling the wagons” against potential scrutiny by Congress. American spending in the Marshall Islands is largely overseen by the Senate committee on energy and natural resources. Spokespeople for Senators Lisa Murkowski, Catherine Cortez-Mastro and Maria Cantwell, all members of the committee who expressed concern in 2018 about relinquishing oversight of the fund, did not respond to requests for comment about whether they would investigate the department’s management of the fund."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T05:00:26Z","webTitle":"‘It would survive nuclear Armageddon’: should plastic grass be banned?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/29/it-would-survive-nuclear-armageddon-the-rise-and-fall-of-plastic-lawns","fields":{"bodyText":"My lawn is a disaster. To be honest, it’s not really a lawn at all. Any green is mostly moss, the rest is mud. More no man’s land than bowling green. The reasons for this are: small London garden (I know I am lucky to have one); not a lot of sun (stolen by the neighbour’s overhanging apple tree); two footballing boys (even though, now banned for life, they have to go to the park). And possibly also inexpertise on the part of the groundsman, though he has tried – I’ve turfed, and seeded, aerated, watered, fed, scarified, sung to it. I’m about ready to give up. There is an obvious solution: artificial grass. Beautifully, uniformly verdant all year round, low maintenance, no mowing required, no mower required, no watering, no mud. I might even let the boys back on to it. Or not. I’m not alone in thinking of faking it. A survey last year by Aviva found that 10% of UK homeowners with outside space had replaced at least some of their garden’s natural lawn with artificial grass, and a further 29% plan to or would consider making the swap. During the pandemic, when everyone was thinking about the outdoors, searches for “artificial grass” jumped 185% from May 2019 to 2020, according to Google Trends. My own search finds dozens of firms offering artificial grass, seducing me with pictures of lawns that look like the green baize of snooker tables. And promises – no mud, no sweat, no tears. And no guilt either – here’s one that says it’s “better for the environment” – because you don’t have to water, mow or fertilise. Well, that’s a relief, though we’ll return to this later. I might miss the smell of summer: freshly cut grass. What, I don’t have to? I can brush in artificial grass cleaner with that very fragrance? Happy days. Soon I have a quote for supply and installation, 40 sq metres of a mid-range product: £2,900 plus VAT. Ouch. But you can just buy the stuff for as little as £7 a sq metre – how hard can it be to DIY? Artificial grass was invented by James M Faria and Robert T Wright at Monsanto and first installed on a recreation area of a school in Providence Rhode Island in 1964. It hit the headlines a couple of years later when it was laid in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, and became known as AstroTurf. Artificial turf for sport, now produced under different brand names by other companies, has become increasingly controversial, most seriously after being potentially linked to the deaths of six professional baseball players in Philadelphia, who had the same rare form of cancer. It often uses rubber granules from recycled tyres, which can contain heavy metals, benzene and other carcinogens. Artificial grass for domestic use and landscaping, which began to be a thing in the 1990s, is normally made from polypropylene or nylon (polyamide) and doesn’t often contain rubber granules. The global artificial turf market (including sports use and domestic use) grew 8.4% in the past year to $4.87 bn (£3.95bn) and is expected to reach $6.83 bn (£5.6bn) in 2027. No wonder so many companies want to put plastic over your garden. Before I take the plunge, I ask Guardian readers to share their experiences of artificial lawns. Some are positive. Several, including Don in Fife and Wayne in Worcester, mention their dogs digging up the old grass. And Alex in Surrey’s greyhounds used to bring mud into the house. Not any more. As well as dogs, children come up. “It’s been wonderful, and the grandchildren love it,” says Charles in Berkshire. And when it comes to croquet, in-house knowledge of the small bumps and inconsistencies in the surface allows them “to win against all comers”. Home advantage – I like it. Phil in Weston-super-Mare did it for his son to play football on – just a little bit in the goalmouth, “so it didn’t become a mud bath”. It was the same for Genevieve in Kent: her kids turned the garden into a quagmire, so they put down fake grass. “It was the most successful thing – they just played football all the time. It was brilliant to have a party on too – people put their fags out on it and it was fine. I think it would survive nuclear Armageddon.” This was a while back, in the 00s, when her family were pioneers of artificial grass. They’ve moved house since then: “We wouldn’t get artificial grass now.” Not just because the kids have grown up. “Because of all the reasons we now know we shouldn’t have it.” *** ‘I can’t stand plastic grass!” bellows the naturalist Iolo Williams, who presents the BBC’s Springwatch, speaking from his home in mid-Wales. “It is hugely damaging to the environment on several levels. First of all it takes away the natural habitat from a whole host of species, notably invertebrates like earthworms, valuable in their own right but also a valuable food source for all kinds of birds and mammals.” Last year’s WWF Living Planet Report found that globally, wildlife populations have plunged by 69% over the past 50 years, with the UK one of the most nature-depleted countries in Europe. This is not the time to be destroying natural habitats and breaking up food chains. “If you want to see blackbirds and song thrushes, you’ve got to have grass full of invertebrates,” says Williams. “People are lamenting the decline of a lot of these birds, but if you stick down plastic grass, what do you expect? You reap what you sow. I would love to see plastic grass banned once and for all. It makes me very angry. I absolutely detest it.” Lynne Marcus, co-chair of the Society of Garden Designers, also underlines the fact that artificial lawns are no-go zones for wildlife. “People may say butterflies or bees can land around it, on the strips of soil we have with a few plants, but it’s like if you put a motorway down the middle of a forest. The animals can’t get from one side to the other to procreate.” With support from the Royal Horticultural Society and the Landscape Institute, the society has launched a campaign on this issue. It wants people to say no to fake grass. The charge sheet is a long one: artificial lawns destroy natural habitats and soil; they contribute to carbon emissions during manufacture and transport, whereas real grass absorbs CO2; they overheat in the summer and contribute to urban heat islands; they cause flooding as they absorb less than 50% of the rain that falls on them; they pollute waterways, as over time the plastic breaks down into microplastics, which is washed into our drainage and discharged into rivers and the sea; they are neither biodegradable nor recyclable, and after their life cycle (typically up to about 15 years) they go into landfill where they will continue to pollute. In short, they are an environmental nightmare, green in colour only. “Every time you put one down, you’re saying: ‘I know we’re all worried about climate change, but guess what, I’m going to contribute to it,’” says Marcus, before adding that she doesn’t want to blame people. “It’s about public engagement with the issue, informing and educating.” She rejects any idea that they are maintenance-free, explaining that over time they accumulate a buildup of excrement and urine from birds, mice, foxes, cats and dogs, and have to be regularly cleaned and disinfected. “You can’t get a plastic bag, yet you can cover your garden in plastic,” says Marcus. “It seems to me there should be something illegal about that.” And she thinks that in years to come we’ll look back at it in the same way as we now look back at driving without seatbelts or smoking next to babies. “Oh my God, can you believe it, we used to lay plastic lawns!” The tide does seem to be turning. The Chelsea Flower show banned fake grass last year. Ed Horne of the RHS, which runs the event, said: “Fake grass is just not in line with our ethos and views on plastic. We recommend using real grass because of its environmental benefits, which include supporting wildlife, mitigating flooding and cooling the environment.” The housing secretary Michael Gove plans to prevent developers from laying fake grass in new housing schemes. The mood is reflected in some more of our reader responses. In Somerset, JP put down a plastic lawn because it was a tiny patch and grass wouldn’t grow. “Within months it started stinking of urine due to the dog toileting on it. About six months ago we’d had enough and I ripped it out. I regret the waste of plastic. We now have a sedum lawn, which loves poor soil and is fantastic for pollinators. I wish we’d done that all along.” In South Ayrshire, Dennis inherited a plastic lawn when they moved to their place. “It was filthy, and had faded to a light insipid green.” So they removed it, and the gravel underneath, imported topsoil and compost, and planted butterfly- and bee-friendly shrubs and flowers. “Our garden, lifeless before, is now full of life.” Barbara Samitier, a French garden designer working in London, thinks that the need for a perfect green lawn may be a peculiarly British thing. “You can’t imagine a garden without it. I think it belongs to the kind of imagery maybe from cricket, Wimbledon, this green and pleasant land. It’s what people in this country have been raised to see as nature.” There are alternatives that aren’t plastic, even if you have a small, north-facing city garden and children. “You can do a little woodland, make it more a sort of exploratory playground. A family garden doesn’t need to be about an expanse of lawn – there are different ways to engage children outdoors.” Even if you have a lawn, it doesn’t have to look like Centre Court on the opening day of Wimbledon. “If I look at a perfect lawn, it doesn’t make me feel relaxed,” says Samitier. “I’m thinking it uses a lot of water, requires a lot of cutting, also chemicals to keep it weed-free and to keep it going in spite of the changes in weather. Whereas if I look at a less perfect lawn with maybe some long grass, areas that haven’t been mown, I know there is a lot of life in there, insects and pollinators. For me, that looks a lot more beautiful.” It’s about accepting the seasons. “It doesn’t have to be perfect all the time, so in the winter it gets muddy, in the summer it’s dry but that’s fine: it comes back when it rains. I think in England a lot of gardens are about ego and controlling, making everything do exactly what you want, the grass needs to be perfect and all of this. But now we see the beauty of letting go a bit and accepting we don’t have to control everything.” Artificial grass makes Samitier’s heart sink. “Don’t do it! You’ll regret it,” she warns me. But it’s OK, because I’m already moving away from plasticking over my scruffy little urban patch and trying to see it in a new light. Not mud and mess, but life and beauty … well, let’s not carried away. Not no man’s land, though, nor no beast’s land. There is birdsong. And right on cue, almost as if it was paid, a dunnock shuffles on to my not-lawn and starts hopping around, hunting for breakfast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/2023/aug/15/humza-yousaf-on-tackling-toxic-masculinity","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-15T14:00:20Z","webTitle":"Men in power must take lead on tackling toxic masculinity, says Humza Yousaf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/15/humza-yousaf-on-tackling-toxic-masculinity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/aug/15/humza-yousaf-on-tackling-toxic-masculinity","fields":{"bodyText":"Men in positions of power must take the lead in tackling toxic masculinity, which is a root cause of gender-based abuse, Scotland’s first minister has said. Writing for the Guardian, Humza Yousaf said: “It is simply not good enough to say ‘it is not all men’ and wash our hands of the problem we have collectively created; every single man can, and should, play his role in making change.” Yousaf said his growing awareness had caused him to reflect on his own behaviour. “Without doubt, in my younger years I will have told a misogynistic joke at the expense of women, or not challenged behaviour that was demeaning to women.” He said becoming a father to two daughters, as well as witnessing global regression in women’s rights, for example on abortion in the US and education in Afghanistan, had made him determined to use his position to “root out and tackle the toxic masculinity and male self-entitlement that leads to violence, harassment, misogyny and abuse against women”. Yousaf, who has faced a series of challenges since he replaced Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader in March, including the ongoing investigation into party finances in which Sturgeon was arrested, a toxic confrontation with Westminster over gender recognition reform, a byelection in Rutherglen against a resurgent Scottish Labour and a festering row among MSPs about their governing alliance with the Scottish Greens, said he wanted Scotland to show “global leadership”. He has pledged to continue the work of the Barack Obama-inspired National Council for Women and Girls set up by his predecessor and appointed a gender-balanced cabinet as Sturgeon did. “There is a great opportunity for all men in positions of influence to demonstrate real leadership on this hugely important issue,” he said. “Whether in politics, in the office, on the work site, in school, the pub or our own living rooms, we can all do more as men to challenge problematic behaviour among our friends, colleagues and family members.” He said “finger wagging is not the answer”, insisting it was crucial to understand why thousands of young men and boys in Scotland were attracted to celebrity misogynists such as Andrew Tate. “As men, we must listen, we must learn but we also must demonstrate what a positive male identity looks like to our young boys and to other men,” Yousaf said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T15:00:29Z","webTitle":"Albanese government approves first new coalmine since taking power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/11/albanese-government-approves-first-new-coal-mine-since-taking-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The Australian government has approved a new coalmine development for the first time since it was elected last year. Tanya Plibersek, the federal environment minister, indicated she would give the green light to the Isaac River coalmine in Queensland’s Bowen basin. It was announced late on Thursday. The mine, to be developed by Bowen Coking Coal, is planned for 28km east of Moranbah, next to five other coalmines, and expected to produce about 500,000 tonnes of metallurgical coal a year for five years. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used in steelmaking. “The Albanese government has to make decisions in accordance with the facts and the national environment law – that’s what happens on every project, and that’s what’s happened here,” a spokesperson for Plibersek said. “Since the election we’ve doubled renewable energy approvals to a record high. The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis, under the law.” The government said no submissions had been received about the project during the public consultation period, including from environment groups. But climate campaigners had made public statements calling on Plibersek to reject the mine in line with scientific advice that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C. “Scientists, energy and climate experts have said that the climate cannot afford new coalmines, and they’ve said it so many times I’ve lost count,” said Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute. “The fact that this is a small coking coalmine is beside the point – fossil carbon needs to stay in the ground. We’ve already got more than enough coalmines approved to cook the planet, including coking coalmines that could run into next century. “This approval comes late in the evening in budget week, the perfect time for controversial news.” The announcement comes a week after Plibersek cancelled two coal projects whose applications had lapsed. Dr Coral Rowston, the director of EnvA (Environmental Advocacy) CQ, a grassroots group in central Queensland, said the project would affect habitat for the vulnerable ornamental snake. “The other key issue for us is the mine will also leave a legacy for our water quality in central Queensland due to the release of affected water from sediment dams into the Isaac River which feeds into the Great Barrier Reef.” Plibersek also plans to move three other projects – two in New South Wales and one in Queensland – to the next stage of the assessment process. The three mines are among a group of 19 proposed new coal and gas projects that Environment Justice Australia, on behalf of the Environment Council of Central Queensland, had sought to have reconsidered and effectively rejected because of their potential greenhouse gas emissions. “Today’s decision means minister Plibersek joins a long line of federal environment ministers who have said it’s not their job to consider the climate risk of new coal and gas mines,” the council’s president Christine Carlisle said. The government found it could not stop the projects at this point in the process because national environmental laws state they would have to prove the emissions of a specific project would be a substantial cause of climate change effects on matters of national environmental significance. Of the remaining 16 projects, five have been withdrawn by the developers or cancelled by the government due to lapsed applications. Thursday’s decision leaves 11 still to be reconsidered by Plibersek. Environmental Justice Australia senior lawyer Retta Berryman said: “Our client is carefully considering all legal options in light of today’s decision – including one or more federal court challenges.” • This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to remove a statement from Coral Rowston referring to koala and greater glider habitat. The Isaac River mine that has been approved would not affect those areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/05/iranian-envoy-uk-iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-missile-development","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T12:06:23Z","webTitle":"Iranian envoy tells UK to stick to terms of nuclear deal and lift missile sanctions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/iranian-envoy-uk-iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-missile-development","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/05/iranian-envoy-uk-iran-nuclear-deal-sanctions-missile-development","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK, France and Germany should stick to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal and lift sanctions on Iranian missile development, Tehran’s chargé d’affaires to London has said. Speaking on the eve of a UN security council debate on Iran, Mehdi Hosseini Matin said on Wednesday that such a breach would lead to the collapse of the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA). It would, he added, also affect the atmosphere around recent bilateral talks in Oman between Iran and the US to secure a separate mini-agreement covering the release of US prisoners, maintaining aspects of the nuclear deal and the release of Iranian assets frozen abroad. Matin said: “The UK and its European partners need to think strategically and it will be a big mistake not to lift sanctions. Europe should think twice. They will just have shot themselves in the foot. The structure of the JCPOA should be preserved, and if it is not they would be held accountable. We will not act now, but we will respond when we see what is announced.” Iranian officials said one possible response would be higher levels of enrichment of uranium by Iran or the country’s withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). In 2018, Donald Trump quit the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, saying he was going to apply maximum economic sanctions in an attempt to force Iran to agree a new deal to constrain its nuclear programme and its behaviour in its region. Trump’s successor, Joe Biden, sought to negotiate the terms for the US to rejoin the deal, but the talks in Vienna stalled amid disagreements over the UN inspection regime and Iran’s explanations for its past activities at specific nuclear sites. The UK, France and Germany remained signatories to the deal, which has so far prevented Iran producing weapons-grade uranium. Matin was responding to reports that the UK and other two European powers were planning to maintain sanctions related to Iranian missile production after 18 October, the date they are due to be lifted under the terms of the 2015 deal. The European powers have said repeatedly Iran is breaching the clauses on missile production in the deal. But Matin said the 2015 deal only “called upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear missiles, including launches using such technology”. He said the wording did not represent an obligation on Iran. Matin, who is the most senior Iranian diplomat in London, said Iran was not producing such weapons and added that any sale of drones by his country to Russia was not covered by the nuclear deal since these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were neither a weapon nor a missile. Ukraine had not fully taken up the opportunity offered to put its case that Iranian missiles were being used by Russia, he said. The 2015 nuclear deal’s three European signatories have insisted in more than a dozen letters to the UN secretary general since 2018 that Iran has breached different aspects of the ballistic missile clauses of the agreement, sending a destabilising message to the region. The UK ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, said this week: “Iran is in flagrant breach of UN resolution 2231 [which enshrines the nuclear deal] not least in the way it is selling UAVs to Russia for the war in Ukraine.” She added: “We think Iran has three times the amount of highly enriched uranium needed to manufacture a nuclear device, so the stockpiles are high and Iran’s ability to enrich uranium is high, so that is a situation that is causing us a lot of concern, so that is why we are working so hard to agree what to do next about that.” The lifting of the complex web of sanctions linked to Iran’s ballistic missile programme would affect a number of Iranian defence firms close to the Tehran regime. In the UK, the chair of Labour Friends of Israel, Steve McCabe, has written to the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, to say it would be outrageous if sanctions were lifted, given Iran’s egregious and consistent breaches of the nuclear accord. Matin insisted Iran’s increase in the amount of enriched uranium beyond the limits set in the JCPOA did not in itself constitute a breach of the deal since article 37 of the accord stated: “If sanctions are reinstated in full or part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under the deal.” All the steps Iran had taken after the US pulled out of the deal in 2018 were reversible, he added. Speaking to France 24, the head of the UN nuclear inspectorate in charge of verifying the nuclear deal admitted the accord was in very bad shape. Rafael Grossi said: “It is an empty shell, basically. No one has declared it dead, but there is no diplomatic activity around it. “If there is any alternative agreement I hope we will be invited to be the ones to inspect and verify that whatever commitments are made are for real and not just a piece of paper.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/02/network-of-geothermal-power-stations-could-help-level-up-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Network of geothermal power stations ‘could help level up UK’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/network-of-geothermal-power-stations-could-help-level-up-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/02/network-of-geothermal-power-stations-could-help-level-up-uk","fields":{"bodyText":"A network of underground geothermal plants is being touted as a way to help level up the UK after a report discovered many areas with the greatest geothermal potential lie beneath the towns and cities most in need of investment. Areas that have been earmarked by the government as part of its levelling up agenda are about three times as likely to be rich in untapped energy from the earth, according to an academic study commissioned by No 10. The University of Durham found these include Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, East Lindsey, Hartlepool, Northumberland and Bassetlaw, which all appear in the top 10 of the index used by government to identify local authority areas in need of levelling up. Other areas well-suited to producing geothermal heat and electricity include Newcastle upon Tyne, North East Derbyshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire and Nottingham. Harnessing geothermal energy involves drilling a borehole to depths of about two to three miles, to flow cold water at low pressures through the hot rocks beneath the Earth’s surface. A second borehole returns the warm water to the surface where it can be used to heat homes and businesses or generate electricity. Kieran Mullan MP, who was tasked with producing the report, said the “strong overlap” between areas in need of investment and the best geothermal locations was unexpected, but it could provide another reason for the government to look again at supporting the renewable energy technology. “Unlike wind or solar this technology provides baseload – it is there constantly. And our expertise in drilling in the North Sea means we are well placed to motor ahead,” Mullan said. The UK’s early steps into geothermal energy include a project in Seaham, County Durham, which will use water from mineshafts to heat 1,500 new homes and a scheme at the Eden project in Cornwall which generates heat to warm Eden’s rainforest and Mediterranean biomes as well as offices, kitchens and greenhouses. In theory, the UK has enough geothermal energy trapped underground to heat every home for a hundred years. Even by conservative estimates that account for realistic commercial and logistical limits, geothermal energy could help the UK to cut its imports of fossil fuels and rely only on the North Sea for its gas. “But we have catching up to do because across Europe there has been much stronger government intervention to support nascent deep geothermal industries in those countries,” Mullan said. Deep geothermal energy is abundant in Iceland owing to its unique geology but countries in western Europe are increasingly using geothermal energy to help produce green heating. Already more than 250,000 homes in Paris rely on geothermal heating and the German government has committed to spending €1bn (£860m) before 2035 to create 100 geothermal projects. Rishi Sunak said the report would help the government decide whether there was a bigger role for deep geothermal energy in the UK economy. “We have made rapid progress on switching to homegrown renewable electricity and have made energy security a key priority. Success is going to depend on pulling all the levers at our disposal,” the prime minister said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/29/pacific-pulling-power-western-leaders-rush-to-region-in-effort-to-counter-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T02:42:31Z","webTitle":"Pacific pulling power: western leaders rush to region in effort to counter China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/29/pacific-pulling-power-western-leaders-rush-to-region-in-effort-to-counter-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/29/pacific-pulling-power-western-leaders-rush-to-region-in-effort-to-counter-china","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, took off his suit jacket and tie on Friday and wandered through more than a mile of the wild forests of Papua New Guinea, accompanied by the country’s prime minister, James Marape. The leaders’ walk through the lush Varirata national park was underlined by the signing of a new environmental initiative – backed by French and EU financing – that will reward countries that preserve their rainforests. At the final stop on their forest walk, they both came to a panorama of partially forested hills stretching into the distance, newly named in the VIP visitor’s honour: “Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frederic Macron Lookout”. Macron’s Papua New Guinea tour capped off a wave of diplomatic manoeuvres across the Pacific this week that included trips by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. The flurry of high-level visits comes amid a growing battle between the US and China for influence in the South Pacific. Beijing has sought to establish influence through aid and financing projects and last year it struck a security agreement with Solomon Islands. In response, Washington and its allies have stepped up diplomatic efforts and expanded military cooperation in an effort to reinforce links with Pacific governments and provide a counter to China. Green diplomacy Macron began his trip in New Caledonia, followed by Vanuatu and then Papua New Guinea. The presidential palace said the purpose of Macron’s trip was as much to “re-engage” France in the Pacific as “offer an alternative” to the growing influence of China in the region. France assumes sovereignty for three territories in the Pacific: New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna. Macron used the visit to tell to Pacific leaders that France understands the threat they face from a warming Earth, from rising seas swamping low-lying islands to a loss of wildlife, wilder weather and the financial costs they impose. It is a message he emphasised on the eroded coastline of New Caledonia and in the sea-threatened archipelago of Vanuatu, where he joined a call for the phasing out of fossil fuels. Macron’s environmental push in the South Pacific is not unique: others including the United States, China, Australia and New Zealand finance significant climate change aid in Pacific island states. However, the so-called Forest, Climate, Biodiversity project, signed on Friday with Papua New Guinea and to be managed by the French development agency, was the key plank of Macron’s visit to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea sees renewed focus The visit by Macron – as well as from Austin earlier in the week – mark an increasing strategic focus on Papua New Guinea. This year the country in the south-west Pacific has received visits from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. The US president, Joe Biden, cancelled a planned trip due to the then unresolved US debt ceiling crisis. While in Port Moresby, Austin discussed the next steps following the recent signing of a defence cooperation deal that would expand the Pacific island nation’s capabilities and make it easier for the US military to train with its forces. The defence secretary, however, stressed the US was “not seeking a permanent base” in Papua New Guinea. “We have a longstanding relationship with Papua New Guinea and we share that vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific and we both really respect the rules-based and value the rules-based international order,” Austin said. Marape said Papua New Guinea’s military “stands to benefit, but more importantly … with our military, the economy and the country-to-country relationships will be strengthened going forward.” After the surprise security agreement between China and Solomon Islands was announced last year, Washington sought to present itself as a counter to Beijing’s expanding influence in the region. The United States – the dominant military force in the South Pacific since the second world war – responded by announcing new aid, opening embassies in the region and signing pacts, like the one with Papua New Guinea. China’s ‘problematic behaviour’ Blinken began his trip in to the region on Wednesday by officially opening a new US embassy in Tonga. While there, he called out what he saw as “problematic behaviour” by Beijing. During a press conference with the Tongan prime minister, Siaosi Sovaleni, Blinken stated that the US had no objection to China’s engagement with the region but there were concerns that its investments needed to be transparent and undertaken with sustainable finance. Blinken and Sovaleni later discussed the bilateral relationship, as well as regional and global issues, according to state department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Miller said the US was “following through” on commitments made by Biden to “elevate our diplomatic and development presence and engagement in the region”. He said the visit also highlighted US efforts to tackle the climate crisis in the Pacific. Blinken then travelled to New Zealand and has ended his trip with Austin for a meeting with their counterparts in Australia. While there, Austin sought to highlight what he labelled China’s “bullying behaviour”. China has imposed a series of official and unofficial trade barriers against Australian exports in recent years, including coal, wine, barley, beef, seafood and wood. Since a change in Australia’s government last year, the relationship between Canberra and Beijing has been seen to be thawing.

China and other countries, however, have threatened to further restrict Japanese seafood imports if the water discharge goes ahead. The EU announcement came after talks at a summit in Brussels between the European Council president, Charles Michel, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The EU’s decision to lift all remaining restrictions, possibly next month, comes days after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved Japan’s water release plans in a key safety review, saying the move would have “a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment”. The EU has loosened import curbs several times since 2011, when the plant was struck by a powerful earthquake and tsunami, triggering the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. But since 2021 it has required certificates showing levels of radioactive isotopes in wild mushrooms, some fish species and edible wild plants from Fukushima and nine other prefectures. The European Commission said the restrictions would be fully lifted – reportedly next month – adding that Japan would continue to monitor produce for radioactivity. “This will help drive forward the reconstruction of the devastated areas and is one we appreciate and welcome,” Kishida told reporters. The EU’s decision is seen as part of an attempt to make progress on the removal of Japanese trade barriers to EU beef, fruit and vegetables, whose access to Japan is limited by food safety rules. Eleven countries now maintain import controls on produce from Fukushima and other parts of Japan. China, a vocal critic of the water discharge, this week suggested it could widen restrictions on Japanese food imports, while Hong Kong said it would ban seafood from Fukushima and nine other prefectures if the water release goes ahead. “Our assessment shows prefectures near Fukushima have higher risks, so we are now taking a responsible way for our residents,” Hong Kong’s secretary for the environment and ecology, Tse Chin-wan, told reporters. Hong Kong is Japan’s second largest market, after mainland China, for agricultural and fisheries exports. It exported fishery products worth ¥75.5bn ($536m) to Hong Kong last year, according to Japanese government statistics. Russia’s consumer protection agency said it would step up supervision of marine products imported from Japan. South Korea’s government endorsed the IAEA report, but opposition MPs are skeptical of reassurances that the wastewater poses no risk to marine species and humans who consume them. During a visit to Japan this week, opposition MPs said the South Korean government had ignored concerns among members of the public, and called for more expert organisations to review the discharge plans. Speaking in Seoul, the opposition Democratic party’s Jung Choun-sook said the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has shown an “irresponsible attitude” towards public health in endorsing the IAEA report. “Isn’t Yoon the president of South Korea?” Jung said, according to the Yonhap news agency. “Trying to solve a problem directly related to people’s health and safety by relying on the goodwill of Japan is not a responsible attitude for a president.” More than 1.3m tonnes of water is being stored in about 1,000 tanks on the Fukushima Daiichi site, with the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), warning that it is quickly running out of storage space. Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system can remove most radioactive elements from the water – which becomes contaminated when it is used to cool damaged nuclear fuel – but it is unable to remove tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials have said the treated water will be diluted so that tritium levels are one-40th of the concentration permitted under the country’s safety standards, before being released into the sea. The operation is expected to take 30 to 40 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/aug/06/starmer-says-sunaks-lack-of-investment-in-wind-power-is-gift-to-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-06T22:39:21Z","webTitle":"Starmer says Sunak’s lack of investment in wind power is ‘gift to Putin’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/06/starmer-says-sunaks-lack-of-investment-in-wind-power-is-gift-to-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/aug/06/starmer-says-sunaks-lack-of-investment-in-wind-power-is-gift-to-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"Keir Starmer has condemned the prime minister’s climate policies, declaring the failure to invest in renewables such as wind turbines a “gift to Putin”. The Labour leader also described the Conservatives’ onshore wind ban as “ludicrous” and said it now means every family in the country is paying £180 more on their energy bills. “Every turbine we fail to build is a gift to Putin, who has strangled the international gas market we are hooked to,” Starmer wrote in the Times. “Last year, President Putin put his boot on the world’s neck by using energy as a weapon of war. But it is Conservative failure over many years that left Britain paying a heavy price.” Starmer’s comments followed a wave of criticism of green policies from Rishi Sunak, following the Tories’ narrow byelection win in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, which some have attributed to a protest vote against Sadiq Khan’s expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) in London. Ministers’ net zero plans were also heavily criticised by their own advisers in June, when the government caused dismay by approving a new coalmine in Cumbria. Sunak has also recently pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves in the North Sea. “David Cameron was told to ignore the long term and ‘cut the green crap’,” Starmer said. “He went along with it and oversaw a collapse in gas storage, prevented onshore wind, abandoned energy efficiency measures and stalled new nuclear projects. “Each cut corner has added to today’s energy bills, piling up costs for every family and business and forcing the government to borrow more. “The tragedy for Britain is that rather than learn from his predecessors’ mistakes, Rishi Sunak is making them all over again.” Starmer also waded in about the apparent divide in the cabinet over new cars being electric or hybrid by 2030. Last week, Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, suggested electric vehicle mandates could hamper investment in Britain and lead to job losses, in a sign that another of the government’s green pledges is in doubt. Badenoch was discussing the automotive industry’s concerns about a rule to be introduced in January that will require manufacturers to ensure at least 22% of new sales in the UK are of emissions-free models, rising each year to reach 80% by 2030. A manufacturer will be fined £15,000 for every polluting car sold over the limit, unless it can buy in extra allowances from another company. The UK ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars is due in 2030. However, there are widespread concerns over whether Britain has adequate infrastructure and capacity for the growth of electric vehicles. Starmer wrote: “Last week we had cabinet members arguing against all new cars being electric or hybrid by 2030, undermining the investor certainty we need to ensure a wide a range of affordable vehicles with the charging infrastructure to support them. “That’s why Labour’s plan will give these manufacturers clarity, turbocharge the rollout of electric vehicles, increase the availability of charging points and lower costs for households in the process. “While Labour is developing serious plans for the future of the British car industry and for British motorists, what is the prime minister focused on? “Trying to create a cultural wedge between motorists and those who want to tackle climate change. It won’t work because British people overwhelmingly both drive cars and want to tackle climate change.” Starmer also distanced himself from Just Stop Oil by criticising its call to immediately cease drilling for oil and gas, saying a Labour government would not revoke any existing licences and he would only block new oil and gas developments in the North Sea. Last week Sunak announced plans to grant more than 100 exploration licences for new oilfields and gasfields before the next election, which experts said could be catastrophic for the climate. Starmer wrote: “The likes of Just Stop Oil want us to simply turn off the taps in the North Sea, creating the same chaos for working people that they do on our roads. It’s contemptible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/08/two-dead-storm-alabama-south-carolina","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-08T16:12:21Z","webTitle":"Two dead and hundreds of thousands without power as storm hits eastern US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/08/two-dead-storm-alabama-south-carolina","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/08/two-dead-storm-alabama-south-carolina","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 300,000 homes and businesses in the eastern US were without power on Tuesday after another storm passed over the region, killing at least two people and disrupting air travel.

Across the US, more than 1,700 flights were canceled and nearly 9,000 were delayed, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Golf-ball sized hail was reported in Virginia, and a flash-flood warning was put out in Maryland, according to the National Weather Service. The Knoxville utilities board said damage across its service area in Tennessee was “widespread and extensive”. In all, more than 29 million people were under tornado watches Monday. But only one was reported – about 30 miles south of Syracuse, New York. “This does look to be one of the most impactful severe weather events across the mid-Atlantic that we have had in some time,” NWS meteorologist Chris Strong said in a briefing live-streamed on Facebook. By Tuesday, the parts of the storm system had moved into New England, where flash flooding is anticipated. Turbulent conditions are also expected across the eastern US through the rest of the week, the weather service said. Stormy weather patterns across the north-east of the US throughout the summer corresponds to intense heat across in the south and south-west, where Phoenix recently saw 31 days in a row of temperatures at least 110F. Seasonal monsoons additionally have been slow to arrive. When Biden arrives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on a re-election campaign swing that includes Utah and Arizona on Tuesday to showcase his work on conservation and clean energy, he will step off Air Force One into 100F heat as well as high, dusty winds.

More than 40 million people in the US are under a heat alert. Texas cities have reached an unprecedented heat index – which combines temperature and humidity. Corpus Christi has hit 125F (51C), while Rio Grande Village notched 118F (47C) and Del Rio marked 115F (46C). States including New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri are also experiencing scorching heat, with the National Weather Service predicting the temperatures to rise further and last into the week of 4 July. The heat follows a weekend of destructive storms that left hundreds of thousands of people without power. The heat dome, as it is known, has settled above Mexico and parts of the US south-west and is caused by hot ocean air that has become trapped in the atmosphere. “These conditions are very stressful to the people living in the region. We are seeing a really intense, wide-spread, and long-lasting event,” said Andrew Pershing, director of climate science at non-profit Climate Central. “Human-caused climate change made these conditions more than five times more likely.” Earlier this week, Texas’s power utility urged users to cut back on air conditioning to alleviate the stress on the grid. Emergency crews in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, region have responded to a record number of calls owing to the heat and lack of power, according to the New York Times. In Jackson, Mississippi, residents reported not having power and air conditioning for nearly 100 hours, NBC reports. An average of 702 heat related deaths happen in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, 69 people in Oregon died from heat caused by a heat dome. On Thursday, an Oregon county filed a lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, arguing that the oil and gas companies are accountable for the heatwave. Unrelenting heat presents particular health and safety risks to older adults, young children, pregnant women, people with chronic conditions and outdoor workers. People of color and low-income residents bear a higher burden from heat, whether because of their occupation or living in close proximity to heat exacerbating industries and heat-trapping highways. At home, vulnerable communities might lack adequate air conditioning. “If you’re struggling financially and worried about paying your electric bill, you might not run your AC long enough, which is going to increase your vulnerability,” Pershing said. Heatwaves like these “will become more common in the future as we continue to burn coal, oil and natural gas”, Pershing said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/14/labour-power-keir-starmer-politics-crises","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-14T05:00:01Z","webTitle":"If Labour wins power, will Starmer’s safe strategy become a huge risk? | Andy Beckett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/labour-power-keir-starmer-politics-crises","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/14/labour-power-keir-starmer-politics-crises","fields":{"bodyText":"The bigger Britain’s problems get, the more Labour seems to shrink. As almost every economic, social and public sector indicator flashes red, Labour politicians explain that regretfully they will only be able to do a limited amount in government about the worst set of interlocking crises in our modern history. The more disenchantment with politics grows, the more narrowly Labour defines the kind of politicians and party members it wants. It excludes or marginalises Corbynistas, leftwingers in general, respected local government radicals such as Jamie Driscoll, and even the mild centre-left organiser Neal Lawson. The few clearly left-leaning figures who remain – for now – in the shadow cabinet, such as Ed Miliband, are briefed against by anonymous Labour sources in the Tory press. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer has increasingly regular chats with Rupert Murdoch. There is a logic to all this purging and repositioning, lowering of expectations and policy trimming. It is the logic that has underpinned successful election campaigns by both main parties since 1997. From New Labour’s pledge cards, with their concrete but modest promises, to the Tory strategist Lynton Crosby’s advice to David Cameron to “get the barnacles off the boat” before his 2015 victory, electioneering in Britain has often been about discipline, repetition and minimising dissent and unnecessary commitments. It may not be inspiring or innovative, but it works, the advocates of this method argue. Look at Labour’s lead in the polls. Yet poll leads and election victories take a party only so far. Once in office, especially at a time of national crisis – as Starmer is likely to be – the gap between wary campaign politics and the more risk-taking and imaginative mode that crises often require can create great tensions in a government. Sometimes premierships are destroyed by them. If Labour wins power, will Starmer’s supposedly safe strategy become a huge risk? Despite the Tories’ claim to be the nation’s natural custodians, Labour usually takes office when Britain is in a mess. Unfortunately, such situations are the only time when many voters are prepared to give the party a try. One example of a cautious Labour government being overwhelmed in such a scenario is still infamous in the history of the party, even though it occurred almost a century ago. In 1929, Labour won power with unemployment rising and industrial relations tense, just as they are now. Within months, the Wall Street Crash and Great Depression made economic and social conditions much worse. Yet the chancellor, Philip Snowden, like today’s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, believed that Labour governments needed to prove their credibility by strictly controlling how much money they borrowed. He resisted calls to increase public spending, then supported cuts. The government disintegrated into pro- and anti-austerity factions. An early general election followed, in 1931, and Labour lost spectacularly, shrinking to 52 MPs. The Conservatives got 470. Given the deep problems of the current Tory party, it’s hard to see it making such a dramatic recovery. But a Starmer government struggling with all the problems left by its Tory predecessors, as well as with inevitable fresh crises, while being blamed for everything by the rightwing press, and also attacked by some of the leftwing Britons he has alienated, is only too easy to envisage. Yet a Starmer premiership doesn’t have to play out that way. Governments can rule cautiously, even in a period of crisis, if they are trusted. For the first two years of Tony Blair’s administration, Labour kept to the Conservatives’ existing spending plans, despite the rundown state of public services, and voters did not desert Labour in a disillusioned fury – probably because they believed, correctly, that better funding from the government would eventually be forthcoming. A prime minister can also persuade enough of the electorate to be patient if they have a clear project. Margaret Thatcher’s long, divisive premiership was partly sustained by the belief of a decisive minority of voters in her vision of a more competitive society. Occasionally, Starmer tries to give a Labour government a similar grand purpose. In January, he promised “a fairer, greener, more dynamic country with an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top”, and “a politics which trusts communities with the power to control their destiny”. So used are we to seeing him as Mr Cautious, these expansive moments do not get the consideration they deserve. He lacks Thatcher’s and Blair’s communication skills, which enabled them to embed their main message even in everyday announcements. He also lacks their consistent quality: the sense that they had an ideology, whether you liked it or not. In three years as leader, he has already shifted from the continuity Corbynism of his initial pledges to the jittery patriotic centrism of his pandemic period to the more confident critic of Conservative Britain that is his current incarnation. In office, he could easily change again. Optimists on the British left – there are still some – hope that he will be more radical in government than opposition, because circumstances give him no option. If public services are in even deeper crisis than now, after possibly another 18 months of Tory rule, then he will need new sources of revenue. With Labour’s ambition for Britain to have “the highest sustained growth in the G7” unlikely to be achieved quickly, if ever, and more borrowing ruled out, then this revenue will need to come from higher taxes. And with most taxpayers struggling financially, raiding the bloated stashes of the economic winners of recent decades is going to be very tempting – whatever reassuring things Starmer and Reeves say to the rich now. Such a sequence of events could be wishful thinking. But it’s too early to say for sure how Starmer might govern. Next week, Labour’s national policy forum meets to help decide what goes into its manifesto. Further policy announcements are likely at this autumn’s party conference, and during the election run-up, which could include another Labour conference in 2024, if Rishi Sunak delays the election as long as possible. If Starmer treats this whole period as an exercise in risk avoidance, and does the same in Downing Street, then he may join the list of failed British premiers.

The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to unveil the plan on Tuesday morning AEDT, with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and the US president, Joe Biden. The Australian government estimates that Aukus will support 20,000 jobs over 30 years, across the Australian Defence Force, the public service and private industry. It poses a looming challenge to educate, train and recruit the necessary personnel, but experts say Australia has a good base from which to expand its nuclear industry. Dr Patrick Burr, a senior lecturer in nuclear engineering at the University of New South Wales, said “we definitely have a healthy nuclear industry in Australia, but it’s often overlooked”, citing nuclear safeguards and research into nuclear materials, nuclear medicine and waste. “On the other hand … it needs to grow manyfold.” Prof Gregory Lane, who convenes the master of nuclear science program at the Australian National University, agrees. “There’s a lot of knowledge about nuclear science. It’s required in all sorts of different areas: mining, health, sterilisation of materials for general industry, industrial gauging.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup UNSW administers the only nuclear engineering degrees in the country, while the ANU is the only one to educate students in nuclear science. “The skills are available in Australia but there are specifics of [Aukus] that we’ve never had to deal with and they’re going to have to be developed over time,” Lane said, adding: “Fundamentally, we don’t have a nuclear power program in Australia.” The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto), a government agency, runs a nuclear research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. Lane describes the Ansto reactor as “one of the most technologically advanced reactors of its type”, which produces neutrons for experiments and to make medical isotopes. “But that’s a very different beast to a reactor that is used for power and then a reactor that you’re going put under water and needs to be absolutely failsafe.” Burr and Lane agree that some nuclear personnel will need to be trained overseas. V Adm Jonathan Mead confirmed last week that some Royal Australian Navy officers were completing a nuclear reactor course in the US and also enrolled in UNSW and ANU programs. Burr said UNSW had about 125 graduates each year across its undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, while Lane said more than 20 students were currently enrolled in the ANU master’s program. For the nuclear-powered submarines, “suitably qualified and experienced personnel” will be required at three tiers of expertise, Burr said. The first tier are those who are “nuclear aware”, which would require only several months of training, Burr said. “In a nuclear submarine … even something as simple as welding a pipe needs to be done by a nuclear-aware welder” – someone with additional training about the implications of working with nuclear-grade materials. “If the weld goes wrong while you’re at sea, it could be catastrophic.” The second tier are people who “have somewhere between five and 10 years of experience, and they typically have an education in engineering as well”. The third tier, requiring the most expertise, are those with 20 to 30 years’ experience and a PhD at a minimum. UNSW modelling, led by Dr Edward Obbard, forecasts that operating and maintaining eight nuclear-propelled submarines would directly require several thousand tier 1 personnel, about 2,500 people at tier 2 and about 200 tier 3 subject matter experts. Experts say scaling up local nuclear capabilities will require national coordination. “This needs to be a coordinated, collaborative effort from all nuclear training and education institutions in Australia,” Burr said. “Ansto will have a crucial role to play, not in education, but in some level of training and some level of government advisory.” Lane said: “We need to be looking at regulation, law, engineering, strategic studies, health – all of these things matter in supporting a nuclear submarine effort.” Ansto declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-03T19:00:17Z","webTitle":"Protest review – schoolgirls unite with the power of dissent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2023/may/03/protest-review-northern-stage-newcastle","fields":{"bodyText":"Hannah Lavery constructs her play from simple sentences. Her language is clear and direct. Each line builds on the last, with primary-school economy. At first, the picture she paints is unremarkable. It is all relay races, bird watching and maths classes. We hear about grandmas, fathers and big brothers. It is as familiar as the monkey bars on Amy Jane Cook’s pastel-coloured set with its pleasing geometric shapes. In interlinking monologues, we meet Alice (Kirsty MacLaren), determined to triumph in the school sports day; Jade (Tamara Fairbairn), certain her family history can enrich the curriculum; and Chloe (Esmé Kingdom), wishing she could connect with people as well as she can the environment. Excellently played, they are eager to please, prone to extravagant bursts of energy and, beneath it all, vexed about a world that is not quite right. Backed by Northern Stage, Fuel, Imaginate and the National Theatre of Scotland, Natalie Ibu’s energetic production has the innocuous air of the playground. Aimed at 8–13 year olds, it initially seems to be more about the excitement of learning than the trauma of high-stakes drama. Yet the more Lavery draws us in, the more the picture of innocent youth fractures. Could that be racist graffiti newly painted on Jade’s way to school? Did someone really dump a mattress in Chloe’s treasured woods? And how is it the boys always get chosen for the team when everyone knows Alice is the fastest? Like the “brittle welcome” that met Jade’s great grandmother and her “friends from the empire” during the war, the security of these girls is provisional. But, asks Lavery, what if they resisted? What if, with their chalk marks, posters and passions, they made a stand for feminism, inclusivity and the climate? What if their small changes could become big changes? As she asks those questions, and as the answers come into focus, so the structure of Protest shifts. No longer is this a play about solo turns, lone voices searching for confirmation. Now it is about collective action and the power of a united front. The girls come together and, in a breathtaking moment, the whole audience rises to assert its communal will.

And yet, in 1995, the renowned Irish artist (later called Shuhada’ Sadaqat) requested UK junglist M-Beat remix her track Fire on Babylon after the pair had met briefly backstage at Top of the Pops the year before. The result was glorious: expansive, shifting beats with her emotive vocal calling out on top. For M-Beat, real name Marlon Hart, the reason it worked was simple: “Her music had realness to it,” he says. “The common ground that we shared was that our music was very sincere.” At Top of the Pops, he recalls, “I’m an unknown council estate boy who has been lucky to have some songs chart. And I’m meeting this big star. But she was down to earth, she said she really liked our music.” Beyond dabbling with jungle, O’Connor’s affinity with Black music and, indeed, Black liberation was a through-line in her career. Her autobiography has joyous titbits such as describing Barrington Levy’s vocal genius on Here I Come (“He just cries out, ‘Shuddly-wad-dily-boop-diddly-diddly, w’oh, oh, oh!’ and it says all the millions of thoughts and feelings a man would have in that few seconds better than even Oscar Wilde could have”). As a child she was obsessed with Muhammad Ali, moved by the slavery drama series Roots (which would later inspire the title for her song Mandinka), and fell in love with reggae songs she heard on TV – a love that continued some years later as she visited record stores at Portobello Road market run by Rastafarian elders. Her late son Shane’s middle names were Ali, after the boxer, and Nesta, Bob Marley’s middle name. She recognised the power of hip-hop and, notably, the reasons the music industry feared it before exploiting it, writing: “A lot of kids of all manner are listening, and no one in the industry wants their top floors threatened by either the wrong skin colour or the wrong mindset – that is, anyone who cares about truth … When showbiz execs realise they can’t kill rap, they will hijack it.” After her death last month, the internet was awash with stories of O’Connor’s solidarity with Black musicians. The 1989 Grammys debuted a best rap performance category – the mostly white Recording Academy had previously ignored the genre and now insulted it by having the category non-televised. Many artists boycotted the awards show as a result and O’Connor, who was booked to perform, appeared on stage with the Public Enemy crosshairs logo shaved into the side of her head, broadcasting her solidarity. She used a win at the MTV awards the following year to call out the network for not playing rap videos (“censorship in any form is bad, but when it’s racism disguised as censorship, it’s even worse”), showing her support for Florida rappers 2 Live Crew in a time when the courts were trying to ban their album for its purported “obscene” content. She showed this solidarity and appreciation through her music, too, recording gospel, rap, wobbly dub, James Brown-sampling soul, and roots reggae. Sly Dunbar of prolific reggae production duo Sly and Robbie worked with O’Connor on her 2005 roots reggae album, Throw Down Your Arms, and also describes her as “down to earth. She come to Jamaica, we just cut the album in two weeks. She was a very caring person, very emotional – like she feels what you’re feeling, and she showed it very much. Sometimes she would talk about her faith; she was into [Jamaican activist] Marcus Garvey and finding herself within the whole Rasta thing and really reading the religion. People probably don’t know why she did it – but she knows why she did it.” Dunbar notes that O’Connor was very much “the one in the driver’s seat” for Throw Down Your Arms. She also worked with R&amp;B producers such as Wyclef Jean and Kevin “She’kspere” Briggs (the latter made the likes of No Scrubs and Bills, Bills, Bills) and in 1994 lent her haunting vocal to Ship Ahoy, a song by radical Irish-British socialist hip-hop group Marxman about the legacy of US slavery. (“It was quite a surprise for the receptionist to see one of the most famous singers on the planet rock up and ask for some random band making demos,” they told the Irish Examiner earlier this year.”) O’Connor also contacted MC Lyte about a collaboration on the remix of her 1988 track I Want Your (Hands on Me). In a Guardian article commemorating O’Connor after her death, Lyte noted: “I think she appreciated the genre for its honesty, and for the ability of those in it to speak a language that was not accepted by the mainstream.” That desire for truth, and her experiences of marginalisation and disfranchisement as an Irish woman in the music industry (not least one who was a mother and who had dealt with child abuse in her own youth) feel central to understanding O’Connor and what drew her to these voices. As journalist and professor Jason King recently wrote in his appraisal of O’Connor’s life as a “freedom singer” for NPR that she “saw parallels between the historical suffering and transatlantic dispossession of Black people and Irish people and she reflexively deployed her music in an attempt to lay down cultural bridges”. This awareness of connected sorrows is something that Boston-based singer-songwriter Shea Rose notes in O’Connor, too. “From understanding her life story, she’s a person that embodied a lot of suffering,” Rose says. “And because of that she could recognise and understand universal suffering in all areas of the world.” In 2016, Rose covered O’Connor’s 1990 track, Black Boys on Mopeds. The harrowing song was originally released as a response to the deaths of two young Black men: Nicholas Bramble, who was killed while being pursued by the police when it was mistakenly assumed he had stolen the moped he was driving, and Colin Roach, who died in suspicious circumstances in the entrance of a London police station. More than two decades later, after the deaths of Michael Brown, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile at the hands of the police in the US, the song remained horribly relevant and so Rose decided to release her version. It spoke to her, she says, because of how O’Connor drew from her own experiences to paint a bigger picture of what was going on in the world. “She gives these beautiful vignettes, these snapshots of different scenes of people who are marginalised, dealing with oppression, not being treated like human beings. And then the pinnacle in the chorus” – the lines ‘England’s not the mythical land of Madame George and roses / It’s the home of police who kill blacks boys on mopeds’ – “is the climax of what happens when we don’t treat each other with civility.” Of course, as Seun Kuti, Nigerian musician and son of Fela Kuti, points out, O’Connor’s politics were not limited to Black liberation. Seun appeared on her final album, 2014’s I’m Not Bossy, I’m the Boss, and stresses: “What we should really celebrate is not her standing up for artists or engagement with music from African people or Black people, but the fact that she stood for truth. That’s the biggest weapon in the artillery that people have to fight oppression. She was able to stand for the people by speaking truth to power, always. And in that aspect, I think she showed more respect for African people, African art, than any other thing that she could have done. And not just African peoples; I mean, she converted to Islam, this woman was speaking on behalf of Palestinian people, on behalf of Indian women. She lived a righteous life. And in a capitalist imperialist system like this, being righteous is crazy.” Seun compares how the mainstream media mocked O’Connor with the way his father was discredited for his revolutionary views. But as with Kuti, he sees the potential for her message to resonate long after her untimely death. “Her mission in life was for the world to be a better place for everybody,” he says. “I don’t think it’s too late for that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T01:00:53Z","webTitle":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","fields":{"bodyText":"Local governments in China approved more new coal power in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021, according to official documents. The approvals, analysed by Greenpeace, reveal that between January and March this year, at least 20.45 gigawatts of coal power was approved, up from 8.63GW in the same period in 2022. In the whole of 2021, 18GW of coal was approved. A Chinese Communist party (CCP) five-year plan from 2016 had placed a heavy emphasis on reducing the use of coal and developing clean energy sources. In 2020 Xi Jinping, China’s leader, pledged that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060. This prompted an era of reduced coal power approvals as local governments sought to keep their local economies in check with Beijing’s priorities. A rise in coal power approvals came in 2020 when the five-year plan came to an end, as local governments anticipated even tighter restrictions on coal expansion in the next round. But in 2021, China suffered huge power outages, leading to a dramatic shift in the CCP’s energy priorities. In September the price of electricity soared as factories reopened to service global demand as the rest of the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government had capped prices, so many power plants reduced output rather than operated at a loss. China relies on coal for more than half of its energy consumption. As homes in the colder north of the country faced the prospect of a gruelling winter without heat, the government’s rhetoric shifted from reducing coal to prioritising energy security. That resulted in a “myth that if you build more power plants, that will bring more energy security,” said Xie Wenwen, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. The war in Ukraine, which sent global energy prices soaring, was “another huge event that fuelled the energy security narrative”. Campaigners argue that in order to meet China’s growing energy needs, it is not more coal that is needed, but a more flexible grid. A report published this month by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, noted that technologies for storing clean energy “are not yet mature enough to be deployed at the scale considered essential” for China’s plans to expand the use of renewable energy. More than 75% of China’s coal, wind, solar and hydro resources are in the west of the country, while more than 70% of power consumption happens in central and eastern China. Five provinces on the east coast account for nearly two-fifths of China’s total consumption. Policymakers have yet to find a solution for efficiently rebalancing this problem. Still, in the 14th five-year plan, which covers the period until 2025, the government said that more than half of increased energy demands in that period should be covered by renewables. Between 2010 and 2021, renewable generation increased by an average annual rate of 19.2%, primarily from wind and solar power. But last year Xi said that coal would remain a mainstay of China’s energy mix that “would be hard to change in the short term”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-19T00:30:08Z","webTitle":"Albanese urged to take stand against nuclear weapons during G7 summit in Hiroshima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/albanese-urged-to-take-stand-against-nuclear-weapons-during-g7-summit-in-hiroshima","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Albanese is being urged to take a firm stand against nuclear weapons when he attends the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend. The prime minister has been invited to attend the summit in Hiroshima, which along with Nagasaki was devastated by the US atomic bombing in the closing stages of the second world war. Albanese is due to arrive in the city on Friday afternoon and will join the mayor of Hiroshima for a visit to the Peace Memorial Park, including the ruins of the former industrial promotion hall now known as the A-bomb dome. A Nobel prize-winning group, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), has written to Albanese to urge him to make good on Labor’s promise to join a new treaty to impose an outright ban on nuclear weapons. The party platform said a Labor government would sign and ratify the treaty, after taking account of factors including the need to work to achieve universal international support. Ican cited Albanese’s speech championing the treaty in 2018 when he denounced nuclear weapons as “the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created”. “At the 2018 National Labor Conference, you showed what strong leadership on this issue looks like,” said the letter from the co-chairs of Ican Australia, Dr Margaret Beavis and Associate Prof Marianne Hanson. “You now have the unique responsibility to show the world once again what leadership on this critical issue looks like. “We urge you to take the opportunity to advance Australia’s position on this treaty when you visit Hiroshima.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The letter argued the acquisition of nuclear-propelled, conventionally armed submarines under Aukus “sharpens the need for a binding and permanent commitment that Australia will not possess, host or assist with the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons now or in the future”. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is a relatively new treaty that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. The TPNW now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it. But it is opposed by the United States and other nuclear weapons states, which argue it is out of step with international security realities. The former Morrison government said the treaty’s terms were inconsistent with Australia’s obligations under the US alliance. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the TPNW “would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security”. Talei Mangioni, 29, who is a PhD candidate at the Australian National University’s School of Culture, History and Language, addressed a youth summit in Hiroshima late last month. She hopes Albanese makes progress on the issue. The Ican Australia board member said she was touched to hear directly from hibakusha (survivor) Keiko Ogura about the “invisible scars” of the 1945 bombing and about visits to Japan by Pacific activists in the 1980s. “At the moment Australia is really out of step with the rest of the region,” said Mangioni, who is of Fijian and Italian descent and whose research focuses on the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement. “Most Pacific countries have either signed or ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. If he were to commit to the TPNW, I think it would send a great message to the region. The nuclear test legacy is a very serious issue in the Pacific and also for Aboriginal communities in Australia.” During the Albanese government’s first year in office, Australia has taken some cautious steps to engage with the TPNW, including sending a backbencher as an observer to the first meeting of the parties in Vienna last June. Australia followed that up by shifting its position at a UN committee in October to “abstain” after five years of actively opposing the treaty under the Coalition. But Albanese and senior ministers have avoided giving a clear timetable for joining the TPNW. Responding to a question from the independent MP Zoe Daniel in March, Albanese said a world without nuclear weapons “would be a very good thing”. “What we will do, though, is work systematically and methodically through the issues in accordance with the commitments that were made in the national platform,” he told parliament. Australia is not a G7 member but has been invited by Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to attend the Hiroshima summit as an outreach partner. Albanese said the government was “showing the world that Australia is back as a partner, a leader and a force for stability and growth in our region”. The leaders of the four Quad countries – Australia, Japan, the US and India – are expected to have a meeting on the sidelines this weekend. It follows the cancellation of next week’s Quad summit in Sydney after the US president, Joe Biden, cut short his regional travel to deal with the debt ceiling crisis. On Friday Albanese is expected to meet with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/jun/27/a-nuclear-reactor-of-music-the-story-of-simple-minds-classic-album-empires-and-dance","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-27T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"‘A nuclear reactor of music’: the story of Simple Minds’ classic album Empires and Dance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/27/a-nuclear-reactor-of-music-the-story-of-simple-minds-classic-album-empires-and-dance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jun/27/a-nuclear-reactor-of-music-the-story-of-simple-minds-classic-album-empires-and-dance","fields":{"bodyText":"During a break in rehearsals for Simple Minds’ 2020 arena tour, conversation turned to the fact that the guitarist Charlie Burchill had moonlighted on saxophone on the band’s early records. Their drummer, Cherisse Osei, was intrigued. With some reluctance – Burchill likens his youthful forays on the sax to “the cat getting strangled” – he played Osei Twist/Run/Repulsion. A sound collage lurking with menaces on the second side of their 1980 album, Empires and Dance, Burchill’s foghorn alarums vie with a sickly semitone bass shift, the singer Jim Kerr’s torrential abstractions, and a woman reciting a passage from a Nikolai Gogol short story in its French translation. “Cherisse was like: ‘What’s that?!’” Burchill mimes a horrified facial expression. “Because it’s fucking bonkers.” Pondering whether Simple Minds would ever plan a themed album tour around Empires and Dance, the guitarist shakes his head. “I think it would be a bit obscure, that one.” Kerr, too, recently enjoyed a similar interaction. “We were playing some of Empires and Dance and one of the band said: ‘Love the new stuff!’ It’s great that it sounds that contemporary. Some of the people we work with weren’t even born when that album came out.” The two tales are illustrative. Empires and Dance can feel a long way away – not merely from the current iteration of the band that made it, but also from the world of music as it is now. Yet it is also a strikingly resonant record, almost disquietingly prescient. “Europe has a language problem”? OK. Keep talking. “Empires and Dance was massive for me,” says the Manic Street Preachers frontman James Dean Bradfield. “It was almost like learning a new language. It’s a nuclear reactor of musical orchestration from five working-class Glasgow boys – it’s fucking brilliant.” He says Empires and Dance taught him that “you don’t have to be like a bad actor, asking: ‘What is my motivation?’ You can just let the music come through you … It taught me to look a bit farther beyond and not to be worried of pretension, either. Go into your brain and see what’s there.” Sustaining an overpowering and unrelenting mood, music, voice and words perfectly in lockstep, Empires and Dance is a Mitteleuropean psychodrama. It strips a continent down to bare lightbulbs and hard wiring, the pomp and pretence of classical culture raised up only to be kicked in. Unwavering, uncompromising, steely, committed, it is powered by a fearsome cohesion of intent; not a single crack breaches a shared sense of purpose. For their previous album, 1979’s exquisite and bewildering Real to Real Cacophony, Simple Minds played outside the UK for the first time. Seventy-two hours in New York had felt like a fever dream, vivid but barely real. Europe made a deeper and more sustained impression. “That European tour was a big thing,” says John Leckie, the producer of Empires and Dance. “They were attracted to it. The Beatles, rock’n’roll, American country, Johnny Cash – forget all that. Europe was the future, the way forward.” At home, Kerr has a framed and mounted black-and-white photograph of the band in 1980, shot at the Berlin Wall. “We did grow up in the shadow of all of that,” he says. “We’d get to places with all these famous names we knew from history – bad history. I remember being in Paris and a synagogue was set on fire just down the road from where we were. In Germany, it was the Baader-Meinhof gang. When we got to Italy, it was the Red Brigade. All the stuff that, sitting here, you read about in the newspapers, it was in the air, it was around. I started to write sort of as a character moving through all of that.” Kerr calls Empires and Dance “a travelogue with spiky dance music. We were young men travelling through classical Europe, reading Camus, and it was all feeding the machine.” Burchill toured with a case filled with novels, which were passed around. Kerr borrowed The Master and Margarita, which made a deep impression. Reading Albert Camus and Mikhail Bulgakov by day, by night, crucially, they were listening to Chic, Kraftwerk, Donna Summer, Michael Rother and Grace Jones in the clubs. “We were bedding into the culture, because we were clubbing it every night and having a brilliant time,” says the former keyboardist Mick MacNeil. “Doing a lot of smoke, meeting a lot of women, thoroughly enjoying what age we were, on tour. It felt natural … We’d be listening to Grace Jones or something funky in a German nightclub and thinking: I really like that. Then you go back home and it obviously starts to bleed through.” As Simple Minds travelled by road from Hamburg to Berlin, barely 24 hours after arriving on the continent, they witnessed megatonnage of military hardware passing on the other side of the autobahn, a seemingly endless line of tanks, trucks and missile launchers, dozens of helicopters tracking them above. It was a huge military exercise involving British, American and West German forces. The cold war was at its height, but the second world war didn’t seem so far away, either. “In central Europe men are marching” – still. On Empires and Dance, everything about the continent’s strangeness is romanticised, catastrophised, heightened. Kerr travels through this stylised landscape as the observing alien-fugitive – dragged in, shoved out, exhilarated, frightened, spilling images and words. “It’s not defined, but it’s a travelogue,” he says. “The person seeing this stuff is a bit ambivalent. It’s voyeuristic. Churches everywhere, these great cathedrals and monuments, which, still, dominate everything. It broods, but it is somehow glamorous, too.” The singer’s agitated reportage layers old European decadence – prewar “drug cabarets”, postwar drudgery, the rot and stink of classical civilisation decomposing (the first image we have is of “cities, buildings falling down”) – on top of first-hand observations and secondhand imaginings of new European turmoil. The band follows his path deep into the heart of disco-rock darkness. Empires and Dance is nothing so overt as a concept album; MacNeil is keen to point out that there was no conscious attempt to “paint all those pictures” with the music. Through the mysteries of creative fusion, however, when recording began at Rockfield Studios in south Wales, an exhilarating osmosis occurred between the album’s themes and its sound. More than ever, the bassist Derek Forbes and the drummer Brian McGee built the rhythmic scaffold. McGee is Empires and Dance’s unerring pulse, its engine, allowing Forbes to take the melodic lead with a series of extraordinary basslines. Song structures emerged from long jams, stretching from midday until the early hours. “There would be a lot of tape editing if the arrangement needed it,” says Leckie. “It’s labour-intensive, but you get something special. If we’d done Empires and Dance on a computer, we wouldn’t be talking about it today.” The musicians felt liberated by the technology at their disposal. “The gear has always been really important,” says Burchill. “Every single album, especially those first five, you can hear the equipment developing. Almost by accident, something would come up. We’d say: ‘Don’t touch that, just leave that there!’ Then we’d start playing over the top of it.” At Rockfield, they honed the opening track, I Travel, into a hard ball of whirling dance-rock, a post-punk I Feel Love with MacNeil’s juddering Jupiter-4 riff at its heart. Leckie gathered the band around a table-tennis table to bash out the rhythm. Although there is plenty of clatter and kling-klang on Empires and Dance, it stops short of full industrial immersion. The hand claps left real blisters. The producer regrets that they didn’t go further: “I wish we had hit a metal girder or an anvil with a hammer!” Kerr sings it all as though standing at a lectern, a state-branded microphone in front of him, flanked by flags and colonels. If I Travel is a thrilling opener, many more highlights follow. On the almost unbearably taut Thirty Frames a Second, existential panic and the lure of the glitterball unite in perfect lockstep. The relentless Celebrate is chain-gang electro-glam, while the monolithic Today I Died Again is suffused with a dread that can be felt in the bones and the teeth. On This Fear of Gods, Forbes supplies yet another sublime, unyielding bassline as backwards reverb washes over Kerr’s abstract fragment, partly inspired by a recent reading of Jorge Luis Borges’ Labyrinths. The five lines protrude from the title phrase like the sharp points of a pentagram. These are the “song” songs on Empires and Dance. Then there are pieces that Leckie calls “the strange tracks. Fragments. Experimental kinds of things.” These include Constantinople Line, which may be the ultimate musical tour de force on an album filled with them. Kerr is a traveller on the old Orient Express route, Paris to Constantinople (now Istanbul). The train journey is symbolic of his floating identity. He is stateless and foreign, everywhere and nowhere, speaking “a traveller’s language / Caucasian talk”. The man is trapped between east and west, between countries and class. The band loved the obscurity and ambition of Kerr’s lyrics. Empires and Dance abounds in opposing or arresting images, free associations that hint at themes and a unified meaning. Words are used as texture, offering flashes of recognition, odd juxtapositions. Clothes are a recurring motif. There are soldiers everywhere, legionnaires, marines. Uniforms bleach away identity just as effectively as the poverty of oppression. “By the time we got to Empires and Dance, in retrospect, you can really hear Jim’s development,” says Burchill. “Tracks like I Travel and This Fear of Gods – wow! You listen to that album and feel like you’ve gone through some kind of a journey. It’s in a lot of the titles: Constantinople Line, Kant-Kino. Very Eurocentric.” What is Empires and Dance about? One can never quite pin it down. It’s a series of vaguely connected encounters and experiences that add up to something more substantial than simply a bunch of songs. Everyone is moving: on trains, on foot, going backwards, heading west. Asia looms; languages meet and confuse. “I was aware that he was trying to say something about Europe,” says Bradfield. “He was saying: yes, we have civilisation and we have history, but there is an undercurrent that we can’t decode. People still want more freedom, people still want more identity, and they will do anything to achieve it. That album tries to tell that story.” Kerr says: “The interesting thing for me is that, obviously, you grow away from it at a certain point. It’s like old clothes: I wouldn’t wear that now; what the fuck was I thinking? Then it somehow comes back and finds a new relevance, or is seen through different eyes. The issues never really go away. The geography has maybe changed, but the issues never change – war, violence, human rights, justice. When you go on the big themes, the idea that we could be sitting here now saying that Britain is no longer a member of the EU. Are you kidding me on? So the songs can always be relevant.” At the Lyceum in London on 20 June 1980, Simple Minds performed a set of almost all new material. The album was already finished and they were buzzed about it. “I thought that was the dog’s bollocks, that record,” says Kerr. “I thought: we’re fucking good.” As recently as March 1980, in Amsterdam, they were still filling out the set with covers and leaning too heavily on their influences. A few months later, on the other side of recording Empires and Dance, there was a new focus and intensity. Kerr was by now a magnetic, mesmeric frontman, tough but seductive. He wore plain T-shirts or white work shirts tucked into baggy trousers, his eyes lined with kohl, his dark fringe flopping over a pale face. He held the microphone lightly, by his fingertips, between tenderness and caution, as though it might be a baby or a bomb. “A great frontman, great ideas, great movement,” says Forbes. “A point of focus; weird-looking. He twisted words around and he twisted himself around. I think he got a bit more confident. He was always a bit inward, I think, but once he got up and moved about … he commanded the stage and then the rest of us just got on with it.” Says Kerr: “It might be some arts centre in Germany, but when we knew that we had done the business, that was the only oxygen we needed. We were growing in stature with every gig. ‘We can’t wait to play tonight, we’re going to destroy this place.’ It was very like that.” For Forbes, “the best times were [playing] the clubs. My job was to pull all the birds. Pull them and bring them back, because the band were all shy.” Empires and Dance was released on Arista/Zoom in late September. “It felt like the perfect title,” says Kerr. It kickstarted a trend in the early 80s for album titles linking two artfully (dis)associated phrases: Heaven 17’s Penthouse and Pavement, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s Architecture &amp; Morality, Wire’s Document and Eyewitness and Thompson Twins’ Quick Step &amp; Side Kick are among the records that quickly followed. The cover design, by the Artifex Studio, felt instantly iconic. A stark white border and faux-Cyrillic typeface framed Michael Ruetz’s photograph of a chipped statue of a deposed military grandee, shot against the backdrop of the Parthenon in Athens at dusk. “Straight away, it transported me to some kind of faux-chic communist statement,” says Bradfield. “That captures me. I can see that they’re talking about some point where you’ve passed the delusion of greatness, you’ve passed the creation of vanity and hubris. Now, we’re in reality. Civilisations can stand or fall by their moral structures. This is gamechanging. Now, we’ve got to stand on our own two feet; there is no more delusion. That is what I saw when I saw the cover.” The artwork amplified the darkness and agitation of Empires and Dance, which at times can feel very real. You listen and worry a little about Kerr’s state of mind. He sounds hollowed out, racked, driven from peace: “Play me fear / Only rhythm I hear.” “Being in a band, half of it isn’t reality, especially when you’re performing night after night,” Kerr says. “It was a hyper-reality. From first thing in the morning to last thing at night, my head would be full of it – movies and books and characters. Mad with it all. It was our life at that time.” He recalls sleepless days and nights in the Columbia hotel, the staple scruffy, downright lawless London base for most mid-level travelling bands living away from home on the record company’s tab. He remembers staying up all night, feverishly plotting “mind-blowing” music, living on “three yoghurts a day” and “the girl who would visit at midnight … I still don’t know her name”. They were charged, unforgettable times. Yet everything seemed provisional. Many of the British shows out in the sticks were far from packed. There were long, dismal drives in a tiny van. Beneath the japes, McGee was becoming increasingly unhappy. On top of it all, they felt they could be dropped at any moment. “The only darkness was that, in our naivety, wanting to be an art-rock band, we assumed that we would never be a big band, but if you could get a following, well, even the idea of being a cult group sounded good,” says Kerr. “But the realities came in on Empires and Dance. We were three albums in, never really sold anything, the debt was piling up and there was talk of the plugs getting pulled. There was a shadow there. The counterpoint of that was that every time we played, people would go mental. It might have been 50 or 500, or if we were opening up for someone much more prominent than us, we would blow them off.” They were championed by influential music journalists such as Paul Morley, Adam Sweeting and Chris Bohn, and considered the peers of bands such as Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and Siouxsie and the Banshees. In NME, Morley noted that the music on Empires and Dance was remote but not sterile – a crucial distinction – and lauded Kerr’s “grudge against reality”. This, he wrote, was music that goes “directly against all rock conditioning … melodramatic yet modernist. An authentic new torch music.” The 12-inch of I Travel, hand-tooled by Leckie, made a splash in the clubs and helped Simple Minds make small strides in the margins of the incipient new romantic scene. They had kudos, a growing and fervent fanbase and a superb new album of which they were inordinately and justifiably proud – yet Empires and Dance stalled just outside the Top 40 in the UK and spent only three weeks in the Top 100. The first pressing of the album amounted to just 7,500 copies. “Empires and Dance should have been a smash hit and that’s when we really fell out with Arista,” says their former manager, Bruce Findlay. “I get angry, because we never had the commercial success on record that we were having live.” By now, Ben Edmonds, the A&amp;R man who had signed Simple Minds, had left the label. Aside from the fact that, as Leckie says, “no one at Arista was into them”, the primary problem was financial: the band wasn’t paying its way. “We had so much debt and I think they knew they were just going to get more of this stuff,” says Burchill. “They didn’t know what it was. It was kind of evident that we had to go.” Yet the quality of the album and the strength of the critical reaction “gave us a certain power”, says MacNeil. “It was like: ‘We don’t care how much debt we owe you, we know we have something and you’re not really doing it for us.’” Kerr adds: “There was a feeling that everything was just really good, and the lyrics felt right, and it really felt like it was going somewhere. The record company didn’t feel that, but we did. The landscape was Joy Division, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen … [Empires and Dance] felt part of that, but unto its own – and as good. It wasn’t bravado. It just felt like this was the stuff we wanted to be listening to, as well as be making, and when you get to that level you don’t really have any doubts.” • This is an edited extract from the paperback edition of Graeme Thomson’s book Themes For Great Cities: A New History of Simple Minds (Constable), out now"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/23/ed-davey-tactical-voting-can-lock-tories-out-of-power-for-a-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-23T06:00:34Z","webTitle":"Ed Davey: ‘Tactical voting can lock Tories out of power for a generation’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/23/ed-davey-tactical-voting-can-lock-tories-out-of-power-for-a-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jul/23/ed-davey-tactical-voting-can-lock-tories-out-of-power-for-a-generation","fields":{"bodyText":"The Tories could be locked out of power for a generation if supporters of other parties vote tactically at the next general election, the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, says on Sunday, after his party chalked up another stunning West Country byelection victory. A massive 29% swing to the Lib Dems saw Sarah Dyke take the Somerton and Frome seat, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 19,200. Davey’s party now has a comfortable 11,000 majority of its own, the largest it has ever had over the Tories in the constituency. In June last year the Lib Dems won Tiverton and Honiton from the Tories, overturning a 24,000 Conservative majority as Boris Johnson’s reputation reached its nadir. Tactical voting clearly played a large part in the latest victory, with Labour’s share of the vote dropping sharply to just 2.6% compared with almost 13% at the general election in 2019, putting the party way back in fifth place. The Lib Dems were themselves squeezed in the other two byelections held on Thursday: in Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire, where Davey’s party won only 3.3% of the vote compared with 8.6% in 2019, and in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where it won only 1.7%, down from 6.3% in 2019. As Davey hailed his party’s recovery in its traditionally strong territory of the south-west, he told the Observer that there was now a clear opportunity to remove the Tories from office at the next election and keep them out for the foreseeable future, if tactical voting occurred across the West Country and more widely. “It is no secret that some Labour and Green party voters lent us their votes in Somerset and we are very grateful for their support,” he said. “In many seats across the south-west, voters at the next election will be faced with a similar choice between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. “My message to all voters who want to get rid of this out-of-touch Conservative government is clear: if the Liberal Democrats can win back our heartlands in the West Country, it could lock the Conservatives out of power for a generation.” The Lib Dems, who suffered a near wipeout at Westminster after forming a coalition government with the Tories in 2010, are now rebuilding at national and local government levels. Having returned only eight MPs to Westminster in 2015, they are now up to 15 after their victory in Somerton and Frome and have their eyes on 15 other Tory-held seats in the West Country alone, where the Conservative majorities are lower than in Somerton and Frome. They now run eight councils in the West Country, up from two in 2016. Naomi Smith, chief executive of Best for Britain, which campaigns for better democracy and favours parties working together to remove the Conservatives, said her organisation would be providing guidance to voters ahead of the next election. “In the absence of opposition parties standing aside for one another to defeat this failing government, progressive voters have little choice but to make tactical decisions come polling day,” she said. “But voters can’t take for granted who the main challenger to the Tories is, so Best for Britain will provide constituency-level guidance. For as long as we have an arcane first-past-the-post system that structurally favours the right, such tactics will be necessary.” Neal Lawson, the director of Compass, a centre-left pressure group, who is facing possible dismissal from the Labour party for encouraging people to vote tactically, said it had gained 250 members since his argument with Labour came to light last month, suggesting support for his argument. He added: “To translate big by election wins into a more widespread general election and deep political victory means Labour and the Lib Dems, and also the Greens, systematically squeezing the Tory vote and building an ideas agenda for lasting change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T10:00:51Z","webTitle":"12m Americans believe violence is justified to restore Trump to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/january-6-trump-political-violence-survey","fields":{"bodyText":"Two and a half years after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, an estimated 12 million American adults, or 4.4% of the adult population, believe violence is justified to restore Donald Trump to the White House. Though the number of adults who believe this has declined since the insurrection, recent survey data from the University of Chicago reveal alarming and dangerous levels of support for political violence and conspiracy theories across the United States. The university’s Chicago Project on Security &amp; Threats (CPOST) research center has been conducting Dangers to Democracy surveys of American adults on political violence and attitudes towards democracy since shortly after the January 6 attacks. In new data from April shared exclusively with the Guardian, researchers found a continued support for violence to achieve various political goals on both sides of the aisle, and a general distrust for democracy. The results are particularly alarming as the 2024 election approaches without essential safeguards that some lawmakers say could help prevent another violent attack on US democracy. For the next year and a half through the 2024 election, CPOST will be releasing new survey data tracking continued dangers to democracy every three months. The data will be published first with the Guardian. This data will be critical at a time when efforts to erode democracy feel increasingly prevalent in the United States, from candidates who deny the results of their elections to governmental taskforces attempting to prosecute people who unintentionally violate voting laws. “We’re heading into an extremely tumultuous election season,” said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs CPOST. “What’s happening in the United States is political violence is going from the fringe to the mainstream.” The most recent survey from April 2023 found that an estimated 142 million Americans believe that elections won’t solve America’s most fundamental problems – up from 111 million last September. And one in five American adults still believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, representing very little change from 2021. “What you’re seeing is really disturbing levels of distrust in American democracy, support for dangerous conspiracy theories, and support for political violence itself,” Pape said. Pape said it was important to track sentiments about political violence, comparing it to the kindling for a wildfire. Though many were unaware that the events on January 6 would turn violent, research shows that public support for violence was widespread, so the attacks themselves should not have come as a surprise. “Once you have support for violence in the mainstream, those are the raw ingredients or the raw combustible material and then speeches, typically by politicians, can set them off,” he said. “Or if they get going, speeches can encourage them to go further.” Before the January 6 insurrection, there was chatter on online forums and among far-right groups about potential political violence when Congress met to count electoral votes and certify Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election. But it was Trump’s speech at the White House Ellipse that day that touched off the actual violence, Pape said. That’s why it’s important to track public sentiment about political violence regularly. The instigating event, usually a speech or comment by a person in power, is unpredictable and can set people off at any moment, but the underlying support for violence is more predictable and trackable. The survey found that almost 14% – a minority of Americans, but still a significant number – believe the use of force is justified to “achieve political goals that I support”. More specifically, 12.4% believe it’s justified to restore the federal right to abortion, 8.4% believe it’s justified to ensure members of Congress and other government officials do the right thing, 6.3% think it’s justified to preserve the rights of white Americans, and 6.1% believe it’s justified to prevent the prosecution of Trump. Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University and the author of a forthcoming book on public trust in the military, said that while public support for political violence might seem extreme, a confluence of factors is necessary for actual violence to occur – which is still rare. On January 6, there was a time-sensitive action, an already existing rally, and inciters including Trump who encouraged others to commit violence. “You needed all of that at the same time to turn what would have been latent sentiment of the sort that this survey captures into actual violence,” he said. In addition to wide support for Trump’s big lie about the 2020 election, the survey also found that significant numbers of American adults believe conspiracy theories about the US government, and the number of believers has remained steady over almost two years. For example, 10% of American adults in April said they believe the government is run by Satan-worshipping pedophiles. “The survey confirms what we already knew, which is that rhetoric is really hyperbolic in American political life,” Feaver said. “You can get folks to express support for pretty extreme statements.” An even greater percentage of American adults said they believe in the “great replacement” theory, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that holds there is an active effort to replace white people with non-white populations, including immigrants and other people of color, in white-majority countries. While much of the survey reveals an alarming level of political polarization in the United States, there are areas where the majority of people do agree. Almost 55% of American adults feel like elections won’t solve our most fundamental political and social problems, and close to 50% believe political elites on both sides of the aisle are the most corrupt people in America. Perhaps more optimistically, the largest share of Americans believe in a potential solution to political violence. More than 77% think Republicans and Democrats in Congress should make a joint statement condemning any political violence. “There’s a tremendous amount of opposition to political violence in the United States, but it is not mobilized,” Pape said.

The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, who is from Hiroshima, chose the G7 venue to lend seriousness to his personal call to world leaders to at least agree a roadmap to resume nuclear arms control talks. In February, Russia pulled out of the 2010 New Start treaty, a pact that sets limits on the deployed strategic nuclear arsenals of the world’s two largest nuclear powers, although Moscow said it would nevertheless abide by the limits for the moment. Kishida intends to take world leaders arriving this week for the summit to the harrowing Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, where they will see graphic depictions of the US attack in 1945. An open letter signed by six former heads of state, 20 cabinet-level ministers and experts from 50 different countries including China, Russia and the US lends momentum to Kishida’s G7 theme by saying the world needs more nuclear arms control, not less. The letter says: “United States-Russia strategic stability talks are in limbo and the New Start treaty, which has played an indispensable role in ensuring reciprocal security, is now in question. “As the only existing nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, the world’s two largest nuclear-armed countries, the treaty’s collapse or expiration without a replacement would threaten a destabilising arms race.” Worsening big-power competition is making nuclear war more likely, the leaders warn, and “failure to agree on a new nuclear arms control framework to replace New Start before it expires in February 2026 would also make it more difficult to bring China, France and the United Kingdom into multilateral arms control, as all three are not ready to consider limits on their nuclear arsenals until the United States and Russia bring down their nuclear stockpiles”. The letter was organised by the European Leadership Network and Asia-Pacific Leadership Network and signed by former world leaders, including Ernesto Zedillo, the former president of Mexico, Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand and Ingvar Carlsson, the former prime minister of Sweden. In Russia, the signatories include Alexei Arbatov, the director of the International Security Center at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations; Pavel Palazhchenko, the head of the international centre at the Gorbachev Foundation, and Sergey Rogov, who until March last year, was a member of the scientific council of the national security council and a former adviser to the Duma international affairs committee. One of the most prominent signatories in China is Prof Chen Dongxiao, the president of Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. China has been clear in warning Russia not to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, a threat that has repeatedly been made by Moscow, including by transferring nuclear weapons to Belarus. UK signatories include the former head of MI6 John Scarlett, the former foreign secretaries Malcolm Rifkind and David Owen, as well as the former defence secretaries Des Browne and Tom King. The 256 signatories acknowledge they all have different views about geopolitical competition but say “we all agree that it is long past time to start prioritising nuclear arms control and taking unilateral, bilateral and multilateral actions”. The letter urges Russia and the US to compartmentalise nuclear arms control and isolate it from other disputes by confirming that they will not exceed the New Start limits on deployed nuclear forces, which thus far have not been violated, as well as agreeing to remove the obstacles to full implementation of their New Start obligations. It also calls for the resumption of the work of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, the body that agrees details of US and Russian inspections of each others’ military sites under the terms of the New Start treaty. The body has not met for nearly two years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/25/victorian-electoral-commission-wants-power-to-issue-on-the-spot-fines-at-polling-booths","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-25T07:31:28Z","webTitle":"Victorian Electoral Commission wants power to issue on-the-spot fines at polling booths","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/25/victorian-electoral-commission-wants-power-to-issue-on-the-spot-fines-at-polling-booths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/25/victorian-electoral-commission-wants-power-to-issue-on-the-spot-fines-at-polling-booths","fields":{"bodyText":"Candidates and party workers who harass voters at polling booths could be issued with on-the-spot fines under a proposal being floated by the Victorian Electoral Commission. Appearing at a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the 2022 state election on Friday, the deputy electoral commissioner, Dana Fleming, said there was a threefold increase in complaints about the behaviour of candidates and party workers at polling booths since 2018. “There is no doubt that the climate has changed over the past three elections and in particular this one,” she said. “I’m going to read out what one candidate wrote to us in the election, that this was ‘one of the most bitter, divisive and antagonistic campaigns of my 16 years in politics’. I can only concur with that.” Of the 2,000 complaints the VEC received, the most frequent (278) related to the “conduct of campaign workers, candidates or political parties”, according to the commission’s submission to the inquiry. Fleming said candidates and party workers at the upcoming Warrandyte byelection were also unable to behave when asked to participate in a trial of low-sensory voting. “I personally wrote as acting commissioner to every single candidate and party in relation to that … they were asked to not approach voters who were neurodiverse,” she said. “I can only say that trial was a failure.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Fleming said the experience made her doubt whether introducing a code of conduct for polling booths would help. “If we can’t rely on good behaviour … for our most vulnerable voters, I must admit I would have some concerns about something as simple as a code of conduct unless there were consequences,” she said. Instead, Fleming said the VEC will recommend empowering senior officials to issue formal warnings and fines. “That would be much more effective,” she said. There were also almost 150 complaints to the VEC about electoral integrity, which Fleming said mostly related to “unhappiness with the trading and preferences above the line and group voting tickets” or GVTs. Victoria is the only jurisdiction in Australia that uses GVTs, which allow voters to choose just one party above the line on their ballot, after which their preferences are directed according to agreements between parties. During the campaign, the so-called “preference whisperer” Glenn Druery made headlines after videos were leaked of him boasting that he had helped deny the Greens seats in 2018 to deliver the Labor government an amenable crossbench. Guardian Australia also reported on a sting to undermine his preference arrangements. Fleming said the media attention during the campaign helped bring the issue to the public’s attention. “It does go to the integrity of the electoral process. We need the community to believe and trust that the electoral outcomes and the people who are elected to represent them have been done so properly,” she said. “There is no doubt [there is] unhappiness in the community that this is the current system.” Earlier, the inquiry’s chair, Labor MP Luba Grigorovitch, and deputy, Liberal MP Evan Mulholland, revealed Druery was asked to appear as a witness at its public hearings but declined. “This is disappointing. There are important questions for Mr Druery to answer, given the prominent role he’s played in recent Victorian elections,” Grigorovitch said. Mulholland said “multiple submissions to this inquiry” raised concerns about Druery. Mulholland and fellow Liberal MP Brad Battin also used Friday’s hearing to grill the VEC director of communications, Sue Lang, for appearing on radio station 3AW after the commission referred an investigation into the then opposition leader, Matthew Guy, and his former chief of staff to the anti-corruption watchdog just nine days before the election. During the interview, Lang said the commission “received no satisfactory response from anybody”, leading the Liberal party to complain of “unprecedented interference” in the election. Lang said she told a 3AW producer she would not be commenting on the referral but was asked by the host, Neil Mitchell, regardless. Battin said Mitchell had provided him with a conflicting account. Defending the decision to make the referral during the campaign, Fleming said the VEC “can’t press pause” on its responsibility to administer the Electoral Act. However, she confirmed the matter was under investigation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-08T04:42:01Z","webTitle":"‘Chasing unicorns’: NSW Liberal minister rejects federal opposition push for nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/08/chasing-unicorns-nsw-liberal-minister-rejects-federal-opposition-push-for-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The New South Wales energy minister and treasurer, Matt Kean, has accused the federal Coalition of “chasing unicorns” over its push to overturn the moratorium on nuclear power in Australia. Since it lost power at last month’s election, the new federal opposition has begun a push for the longstanding ban on nuclear power to be lifted. Despite doing little to advance it as an energy source during its time in government, new Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has called for a “mature” conversation about the role of nuclear power in Australia. The new leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has indicated that support for nuclear energy could be a part of the Coalition’s future policy platform, while former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has backed calls to overturn the moratorium. “I don’t think we should rule things out simply because it’s unfashionable to talk about them,” Dutton said on Monday. But amid a reduction in new nuclear projects globally, Kean poured cold water on the push by his Coalition colleagues in Canberra on Wednesday, saying pursuing nuclear energy generation in Australia was currently a “fantasy”. While conceding nuclear “may have a role to play in our energy system in the future”, Kean said he hoped for a role for emerging nuclear technologies – such as small modular reactors – but that they would not help address rising energy costs in the short to medium term. Kean referred to the UK government’s underwriting of the construction of the Hinkley Point C station to the tune of about $300 a megawatt-hour, which he said was “three times more expensive than the current electricity bills at the height that we’re paying right now”. He said the cost and timeline of new nuclear energy meant it was not realistic to consider it as an option. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Not only that, they started the build of [Hinkley Point C station] in around 2008,” he said. “It’s now 2022 and it still hasn’t been turned on, so we can’t wait 20 years to chase some fantasy, which is large-scale nuclear. “What we need to do is focus on things that are going to lower household bills today and set us up for more prosperity in the future.” In 2019 the former federal Coalition government held a parliamentary inquiry into the role of nuclear. Chaired by the new shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, it recommended the government consider small modular reactors, which produce less energy but, proponents say, would be easier to keep safe. But many small nuclear reactor proposals overseas have been beset by problems , and Kean said that two of the firms pushing the use of the technology – Rolls-Royce and US firm NuScale – wouldn’t have prototypes ready for construction until the next decade. “So people talking about nuclear as an asset to our energy challenges right now are literally chasing unicorns,” Kean said. “This is a fantasy, which is not ready at the moment. But who knows, at some time in the future, we may crack the code of small nuclear reactors and that could play a role in our energy mix. “But right now, we are focusing on the things that we know work [and] that we know are going to drive down household bills and that’s why we’ve got our energy roadmap here in NSW to roll out solar, wind [and] pumped hydro storage with transmission lines. Because we know that that’s the best way to lower household bills to keep the lights on and to deliver clean, reliable electricity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T19:00:39Z","webTitle":"Strength and power of Manchester City can reinforce Premier League dominance | Karen Carney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league","fields":{"bodyText":"The Premier League is the dominant force in the Champions League: Saturday’s final will be the fifth in six years to feature at least one English team. Football generally works in cycles, though, and the rest of the continent will be plotting to take over again. In the five finals before 2018, there was not an English side in sight and Spain was lording it over its rivals. Real Madrid won four out of five from 2013 in their dominant cycle, but they have been overtaken. Manchester City enter their second Champions League final in three years against Internazionale, who are the first Italian team since 2017 to reach this stage of a competition Serie A has dominated in the past. In the 10 seasons starting in 1988-89 an Italian club reached nine finals and won four. There are numerous reasons why the English game is enjoying a glorious spell. It is no coincidence the biggest clubs can attract the best managers. Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel have taken English teams into the Champions League with knowledge gained elsewhere of how to beat the best in Europe. They arrived with experience of different leagues. Managers learn from one another, too. Mikel Arteta and Erik ten Hag worked with Guardiola at City and Bayern Munich respectively and they are pushing one another to be at their best. Guardiola keeps evolving, changing things tactically each season to maintain City’s challenge for trophies. Klopp brought his pressing style to Liverpool and has taken them to three Champions League finals. Those styles and philosophies have added to the English culture of technical play and fandom, aided by players wanting to be with those managers. Guardiola knows what worked for him in the past will not necessarily work now. At Barcelona, he, in essence, invented the false 9 for Lionel Messi; at Bayern he did the inverted full-back with Philipp Lahm; this season we have seen him create John Stones’s hybrid role, which was carefully thought out and planned, and it has paid dividends in the biggest matches. Top managers’ tactics only work if they have the right players and the Premier League can attract the best in the world. Almost every team in Europe would like Erling Haaland but City were able to snare him because they have a coach everyone wants to work with. If we look at the clamour to sign Ilkay Gündogan it shows what incredible players City have. Players under Guardiola will be more desirable to bring in because of their skillset. The competitive nature of the Premier League is helping its clubs in Europe. City rarely had an easy weekend this season and had to fight for their points, regardless of who they were playing. There is strength throughout the league, which means the best teams have to push themselves. As an indication of how strong the Premier League is, Leicester won it seven years ago and were relegated this season. No other competition can boast this strength in depth. The need to maintain standards benefits a club such as City when they face quality opposition in the Champions League. What sets City apart, as Internazionale will know, is the physical advantage they have because of the high tempo required in the Premier League. I was at the FA Cup final, which was not City’s best performance, and got to watch from behind Guardiola’s dugout. It gave me a great perspective. I usually think in advance about what I am going to learn about the technical or tactical aspects but what really surprised me seeing City close up at Wembley was the sheer physicality of their team. The defence is really imposing – John Stones is slighter than Manuel Akanji, Rúben Dias and Kyle Walker, but he is still a big presence. Technically and tactically they are superb, but if they are drawn into one-v-one battles, they are physically dominant too – and then there is Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne and Haaland. Not many teams will be able to compete with that on a physical level and then we have to add in how good City are technically and tactically. If anyone tries to bully City, they are going to fail. United really struggled in those physical one-v-one battles. It was something I had never noticed and it was interesting to see. If City have to mix it up and go long, getting Haaland to pin the ball to hold it up, they can do that too. They have every attribute required and character to go with it. They can win the duels, meaning they get the ball back quickly, and their work rate does not give opponents the chance to build a couple of passes or have any respite in possession. That is why sides have to counterattack against them or pick their moment wisely and City are well set up to deal with that. Bayern and Real Madrid learned to their cost about City’s relentless pressing and clinical nature. They will take these lessons and look at how they can close the gap to instigate a new cycle of dominance for German or Spanish football. But the Premier League has the momentum and I cannot see that changing any time soon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T15:24:02Z","webTitle":"Wisconsin senate supermajority win gives Republicans impeachment power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/wisconsin-senate-supermajority-impeachment-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Wisconsin Republicans won a supermajority in the state senate on Tuesday, giving them the necessary votes to impeach statewide officials, including the state’s Democratic governor and potentially state supreme court justices. Wisconsin Republicans now control 22 of the senate’s 33 seats after Dan Knodl, a Republican, narrowly defeated Democrat Jodi Habush Sinykin in a special election to represent a district that includes Milwaukee’s northern suburbs. Republicans also control 64 of the state assembly’s 99 districts. The Wisconsin constitution authorizes the state assembly to impeach “all civil officers of this state for corrupt conduct in office, or for crimes and misdemeanor” by a majority vote. A two-thirds majority is required in the senate for a conviction. Republicans got their supermajority on the same night Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the state supreme court, giving liberals a majority on the bench when she is seated in August. The new liberal majority could strike down the state’s legislative districts, which were drawn by Republicans and give them a virtually impenetrable majority in the legislature. The court is also expected to strike down the state’s 1849 abortion ban. It is not clear whether state lawmakers will move forward with impeachment. The assembly has only once before impeached an official – a judge in 1853 who was acquitted, according to the Associated Press. It’s also not clear who qualifies for impeachment, as the constitution does not define who is a “civil officer”. Knodl, the Republican candidate who won on Tuesday, has said the legislature’s impeachment power would “certainly be tested” if he were elected. He has said he would consider impeaching Protasiewicz, who is currently a circuit court judge in Milwaukee, if she remained on the bench there. He did not say whether he would consider impeaching Protasiewicz as a supreme court justice, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Duey Stroebel, a Republican state senator, told the New York Times that impeaching Protasiewicz over rulings on abortion and electoral maps was not likely “but certainly not impossible”. “If she truly acts in terms of ignoring our laws and applying her own personal beliefs, then maybe that’s something people will talk about,” he told the Times. “If the rulings are contrary to what our state laws and constitution say, I think there could be an issue.” “We can’t say what the legislature will do or how likely any action is. But for this gerrymandered legislature to take steps toward removing democratically elected officials would be a profound abuse of power,” said Dan Lenz, a lawyer for Law Forward, a progressive non-profit legal group. Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin – Madison, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he thinks the legislature is ready to “play hardball”. “Republicans, in their majority for the last 12 years, have not been shy about exploring what tools are available to them and trying to push them as far as possible,” he said. Republicans in Pennsylvania and Ohio in recent years have toyed with the idea of impeaching judges over their rulings on gerrymandering. Talk in both states quickly fizzled. One of the jurists threatened with impeachment, former Ohio Republican supreme court justice Maureen O’Connor, said she never really took impeachment talk seriously. O’Connor was one of the jurists threatened with impeachment after voting with Democrats to strike down GOP-friendly gerrymandered maps. “It wasn’t going to go anywhere – political drama,” she said earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T23:52:52Z","webTitle":"‘Big mistake’: Biden condemns Putin’s withdrawal from nuclear treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/22/biden-putin-russia-nuclear-arms-control-new-start-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden on Wednesday night condemned as a “big mistake” Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend his country’s participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. The comment came as the US president closed out his wartime visit to Europe, working to shore up partnerships with allies on Nato’s perilous eastern flank – even as Putin was drawing closer to China for help as his invasion of Ukraine neared the year mark. Biden’s meeting with leaders of the Bucharest Nine nations in Warsaw came at the conclusion of a whirlwind, four-day visit to Ukraine and Poland meant to reassure allies that US support in fending off Russia is not at risk of waning. In dramatic counterpoint, Putin on Wednesday played host in Moscow to Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist party’s most senior foreign policy official, as US intelligence warned that Beijing is considering supplying arms and ammunition to the worn-down Russian military. The flexing of alliances was a fresh indication that both sides are digging in for prolonged conflict in Ukraine with the fighting expected to intensify with the arrival of spring. Biden had delivered a ringing speech on western unity in Warsaw, a day after he swept into Kyiv unannounced for a visit with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. As Biden spoke in Poland, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. Biden has now called that departure “a big mistake”. The exit is expected to have an immediate impact on US awareness of Russian nuclear activities. However, the pact – known as New Start – was already on life support following Moscow’s cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that each side has accused the other of violating. “You’re the frontlines of our collective defense,” Biden told the Bucharest Nine, which comprises Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. “And you know, better than anyone, what’s at stake in this conflict. Not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world,” he added. These countries have worried that Putin could move to take military action against them next if he’s successful in Ukraine. Biden responded to that anxiety by pledging that Nato’s mutual defense pact is “sacred” and that “we will defend literally every inch of Nato”. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting, pointed to past Russian conduct in Georgia and Ukraine and said: “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/01/gun-lobby-nra-national-shooting-sports-foundation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T10:00:33Z","webTitle":"‘Even more insidious than the NRA’: US gun lobby group gains in power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/gun-lobby-nra-national-shooting-sports-foundation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/01/gun-lobby-nra-national-shooting-sports-foundation","fields":{"bodyText":"A business trade group representing 10,000 gunmakers, dealers and other firearm firms is emerging as a rising force in the US and starting to eclipse – in some respects – the might of the powerful but scandal-plagued National Rifle Association. Meet the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry’s conservative and aggressive lobbying group. Its range of activities is broad but always geared to zealously and single-mindedly preserving and extending the power of the gun industry. It has been lobbying Congress to pass bills that would block financial institutions from using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in making investment and loan decisions to protect gun companies’ bottom lines. Meanwhile, gun manufacturers are relying on this same group to mount legal challenges to several state laws that limit the gun industry’s highly prized and unique protection from contentious liability laws enacted by Congress in 2005. During Donald Trump’s presidency, the NSSF used its lobbying muscle to help prod his administration to move regulation of gun exports from the state department to the commerce department, a shift that seems to have yielded financial dividends for gun exporters due to the department’s pro-business approach. In the past few years, as the 5-million-member NRA has been battered by financial woes, internal rifts and legal threats from the New York attorney general and private interests, the NSSF has expanded its legal and lobbying spending to fight gun-control efforts nationwide, while boosting gun rights and industry sales. “The NSSF functions as the gun industry’s voice, with a singular focus on expanding the market for all types of firearms, including assault weapons and short-barreled rifles, and is eclipsing the NRA’s lobbying power on Capitol Hill,” said Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy and research group. The rising clout of the NSSF is underscored in part by the group’s increased spending on lobbying, which has outpaced the NRA’s lobbying spending in recent years. For instance, in 2020 and 2021, the NSSF reported spending $4.6m and $5m respectively on federal lobbying. By contrast, the NRA spent $2.2m and $4.9m. Further, the NSSF’s legal muscle has expanded in the last year since the NSSF tapped the former solicitor general Paul Clement as an outside lawyer to fight laws in seven states that limit the protections from lawsuits that were granted by Congress. Clement has also mounted legal challenges for the NSSF against new gun-control measures in New York, New Jersey and other states that have been enacted in the wake of a supreme court decision last year against a New York law limiting concealed-carry permits to those people who can show a “proper purpose” for having such weapons outside their homes. The NSSF’s board of governors reflects the group’s financial interests and clout: the board includes top executives from major arms companies such as Daniel Defense and Smith &amp; Wesson, which made the AR-15 military-style assault rifles used in the Uvalde and Highland Park mass shootings. Little wonder the NSSF, founded in 1961 and once best known for hosting an annual and lavish “Shot” (Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade show) in Las Vegas, has become a more active and visible player waging legal and lobbying battles to boost arms company interests, say experts and gun control advocates. “The NSSF burrows in on every nook and cranny of gun regulation as it works to ensure that the gun industry’s financial interests are consistently and zealously represented – on even the most arcane issues. For NSSF, gun violence prevention legislation is literally bad for business,” said Rand. The NSSF’s growing influence is reflected in part by the group’s revenues, which soared to over $51m in fiscal year 2022, versus $36m in fiscal year 2016. The revenue hikes at NSSF have come as the group’s membership has grown in the past few years to 10,000 from 8,000, said NSSF’s general counsel and top lobbyist, Larry Keane. Keane said the NSSF has four full-time lobbyists and is recruiting a fifth for its Washington office, which opened in 2012. Overall, the American gun industry has mushroomed in recent years. Gun sales surged during the pandemic, as almost 60m guns were bought by Americans between 2020 and 2022, according to the Trace, a non-partisan news outfit that reports on gun violence. In 2008, about 8m guns were sold, but in 2016 gun sales had almost doubled to 16m. Gun experts say the NSSF has become a more prominent player in battles to benefit the gun industry’s bottom line. “The NSSF has stepped up its political activities in at least three ways: much more political lobbying and related activities in DC and elsewhere; filing lawsuits against gun laws around the country in the courts, especially after the supreme court’s 2022 Bruen decision; and promoting gun manufacturing and sales data, which is increasingly being cited in court cases by gun-rights litigants,” said Robert Spitzer, the author of several books on gun issues and an emeritus professor at Suny Cortland in New York. Spitzer added: “Unfortunately, their data is problematic, because they don’t fully reveal their methodology, and they have a vested interest in inflating their numbers to support the argument that the more guns and gun accessories in circulation, the more futile gun laws are.” NRA veterans also say the NSSF has become a more robust tool for gun interests. “Given the dumpster fires at the NRA, industry has increased its engagement at NSSF,” a former NRA board member told the Guardian. The NSSF’s key battles now range widely, from the halls of Congress to many states nationwide where legislative and legal fights have intensified. Keane said the NSSF had been working with a multi-industry coalition which includes fossil-fuel firms, dubbed the Fair Access to Banking Coalition, to push for Republican-sponsored bills in the House and the Senate that would curb financial companies from using ESG guidelines in making investment and loan decisions. Keane said that the NSSF’s push for these bills stems from gun-industry complaints about “discrimination” by financial institutions that have adopted ESG guidelines, which have led to decisions by banks and other financial firms being made for “political and not business” reasons. But Nick Suplina, a senior vice-president for law and policy with Everytown for Gun Safety said the “NSSF is riding the coattails of the fossil fuel industry in passing these bills, and made common cause, because doing what is best for society might hurt their bottom line”. He added: “As more businesses and banks recognized that customers expected them to do their part in addressing widespread social harms, big coal and the gun industry have embraced a culture-war veneer to mask their profit motive: declare war on woke corporations. “As a result, the NSSF has pressed legislation that abandons free-market principles and restricts companies’ freedom to set reasonable risk standards for doing business with the gun industry, while fossil-fuel companies try to prohibit consideration of environmental impact.” With Democrats in control of the Senate, the bill’s passage is not likely, but given that Republicans control the House, it could pass there. On another battlefront, Keane said that NSSF members are troubled about several state laws that “gut” the controversial and unique liability protections Congress granted the gun industry in 2005, and “open up the industry to new litigation”. To date, seven states including California, New York and New Jersey have passed laws that permit some litigation against gun companies, thereby undercutting the sweeping liability protections that Congress gave the industry. The NSSF has tapped Clement, the former solicitor general, to fight these state laws in court, because, Keane said, they “open up industry” to lawsuits which Congress blocked in 2005. As the NSSF has become a more robust force in pushing gun-industry priorities, gun-control advocates see similarities and differences with the NRA. “Make no mistake: the NSSF is even more insidious than the NRA with its ever-expanding lobbying operation and abnormally cozy relationship with its regulator,” said Adzi Vokhiwa, the director of federal affairs at Giffords, the gun control advocacy group. “The NSSF hides behind its public identity as a simple trade association, while aggressively working to undermine any and all attempts to slow this nation’s devastating gun violence crisis.” Vokhiwa, for instance, noted that the NSSF ran a television ad blitz, its first ever, to scuttle the Biden administration’s first nominee to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, David Chipman, by stressing his role as a Giffords adviser after 25 years of serving as an ATF agent. “From leading dangerous smear campaigns against ATF director nominees who publicly promise to better regulate the gun industry, and bullying members of Congress to vote against even the most reasonable pieces of legislation regulating guns, the NSSF continues to value gun-industry profits more than the American people’s right to live in safe communities,” Vokhiwa said. Other gun-control advocates say the NSSF, like the NRA, has often exploited fears of gun owners and pushed conspiracy theories about “big government” efforts to undermine the second amendment, in order to rally opposition to gun-control measures. “The firearms industry was peddling anti-government conspiracies long before Trump came along talking about the ‘deep state’,” said Suplina. “That includes claiming that even modest proposals for gun-violence prevention, like requiring background checks on every gun sale, are part of a sinister government plot to disarm all Americans. “The industry seems to hope that paranoia will drive more people to purchase their products and has in fact recognized that, after mass shootings, fear of new laws drive gun sales.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
