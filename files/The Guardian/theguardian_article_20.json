Here’s where we stand: Two civilians have been killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40 km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike on the northeastern city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning has also left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has said. Joe Biden has boarded Air Force One, concluding a historic trip to Poland and Ukraine ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden vowed that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato” territory ahead of talks with Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. All members of the Bucharest Nine (B9) have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. President Biden and the B9 leaders “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of Wednesday afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said he urged Joe Biden to seek Nato deployment of additional military equipment, including Himars artillery or attack helicopters, in the Baltic states, during the US president’s meeting with B9 leaders. He said Biden was silent but took notes as he listened to Nausėda and others on deploying air defence systems in the Baltics and other eastern flank countries. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, has met Vladimir Putin in Moscow, as China and Russia reaffirm their close bilateral relationship just days before the first anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. Wang told Vladimir Putin that Beijing will play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency reported. Earlier on Wednesday, Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expected to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Xi Jinping, China’s president, is expected to visit Putin in Russia in the coming months, although an exact date has not been announced. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Russia’s parliament on Wednesday approved Vladimir Putin’s move to suspend the treaty. Biden has said Putin “made a mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Vladimir Putin has praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland” in a speech at a rally in Moscow to mark a year of war in Ukraine. Thousands gathered at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to attend a concert marking the “Defenders of the Fatherland” Day. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will meet UN secretary general, António Guterres, to discuss ongoing support for Ukraine as the UN’s security council meets this week, the US state department has said. Blinken is expected to travel to New York tomorrow to attend the security council meeting on Ukraine, marking one year of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. EU countries have failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons. Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has urged the UN to establish a special tribunal to try Russia for crimes of aggression to ensure Moscow’s invasion “never will be repeated” anywhere. Ukraine’s victory “would mean the victory of human rights over lawlessness, torture and destruction”, Zelenska said in a video address to a special meeting at the UN on human rights violations in Ukraine. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the UN this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit was an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. A group of 10 EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a leading humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing from bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks occurring in the home and in communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. On Tuesday, Japan’s finance minister said financial leaders of the G7 nations would meet tomorrow, on the sidelines of the G20 gathering in India, to discuss measures against Russia. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. It comes after Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia has been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war live blog today. Thanks for following along, we’ll be back tomorrow. Britain has begun to “warm up” its production lines to replace weapons sent to Ukraine and increase production of artillery shells to try to help Kyiv push back Russian forces, defence minister Ben Wallace has said. Wallace earlier spoke with Ukrainian soldiers who were training to use the UK’s Challenger tanks, which he said would arrive in Ukraine in “the spring”. In an interview with Reuters, Wallace said he believed Britain was in a good place to help Ukraine but needed to sustain the provision of weapons. Asked whether the UK had the commercial capacity to continue to provide Ukraine with weapons such as artillery shells, he said: We have laid contracts ... We’ve started to already now receive some deliveries of that for our own restocking and also some of it to Ukraine. He said shells could be made fairly quickly but “the key is to make sure that we place the orders, and we’ve started placing those orders over the last 10 months and that starts to sort of warm up those production lines”. He added: Absolutely part of the effort this year is sustainability - how can we, the international community, stimulate supply chains, how can we stimulate our own supply chains for our own equipment and that’s been one of the changes Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, has urged the UN to establish a special tribunal to try Russia for crimes of aggression to ensure Moscow’s invasion “never will be repeated” anywhere. Ukraine’s victory “would mean the victory of human rights over lawlessness, torture and destruction”, Zelenska said in a video address to a special meeting at the UN on human rights violations in Ukraine. She said: Regardless of our country or nationality, we have the right not to be killed in our own homes. However, Ukrainians are being killed in front of the whole world for already a year now. Ukrainians are being killed in their own cities, villages, apartments, hospitals, theatres. She added: In any city of Ukraine, in London, Berlin or New York we have the right to live free, not to be killed or tortured. The right not to be blown to pieces by a Russian missile. Each of us has this right. CBS News’ Pamela Falk has a clip of Zelenska’s speech to the UN meeting: Group of Seven (G7) finance ministers meeting in India tomorrow will discuss financial support to Ukraine, according to German finance ministry sources. Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, will also join the talks, chaired by Japan, in the Indian city of Bangalore on Thursday. International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva is expected to give an update on a planned aid programme for Ukraine at the meeting, Reuters is citing sources as saying. The IMF aims to adopt the new aid programme for Ukraine by the end of March, they said. The G7 meeting will be followed later in the week by a gathering of G20 financial leaders from the world’s major economies, to be hosted in Bangalore by India, which has the G20 presidency. The president of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, said he urged Joe Biden to seek Nato deployment of additional military equipment, including Himars artillery or attack helicopters, in the Baltic states. Nausėda, speaking to reporters, said he made the request to the US president while in a meeting with Bucharest Nine (B9) leaders of countries on Nato’s eastern flank. He said: I have talked about deployment of so-called critical enablers - this includes airspace surveillance systems, attack helicopters, Himars artillery. We can hardly afford to purchase this, it but it could be deployed (by allies) to the Baltics on rotational grounds. He said Biden was silent but took notes as he listened to Nausėda and others on deploying air defence systems in the Baltics and other eastern flank countries. Some of the B9 leaders discussed the prospect that Ukraine would be “several steps closer” to gaining Nato membership after a planned summit in July in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, Nausėda said. Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty with the US will not increase the risk of a nuclear war, Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Both chambers of Russia’s parliament voted today in favour of Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend the treaty. Interfax news agency has quoted Ryabkov as saying: I do not believe that the decision to suspend the New Start Treaty brings us closer to nuclear war. Meanwhile, a senior Russian defence official said Moscow will stick to agreed limits on nuclear missiles and keep informing the US about changes in its deployments, despite the treaty’s suspension. A top defence ministry official, Maj-Gen Yevgeny Ilyin, told the Duma that Russia would continue to observe agreed restrictions on nuclear delivery systems - meaning missiles and strategic bomber planes, Russian state-owned Ria news agency reported. Russia would also continue to provide the US with notifications on nuclear deployments in order “to prevent false alarms, which is important for maintaining strategic stability”, Ilyin was quoted as saying. President Joe Biden has been pictured boarding Air Force One, following his three-day visit to Poland and Ukraine. Russia has said it is studying China’s global security initiative (GSI), Xi Jinping’s flagship security proposal. On Tuesday, Beijing launched a government concept paper on Beijing’s plans for a global security initiative, first announced by Xi at the Boao forum in April 2022. The paper described the ideals and principles underpinning Beijing’s plan, rather than specific details or logistics. The initiative would be UN-backed, and “advocate a concept of common security, respecting and safeguarding the security of every country”, to resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, the paper said. It also explicitly rejected the use of sanctions – a long-held position of Beijing’s. It emphasised respect for “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”, which Beijing regularly cites in dismissing international criticism of its activities, including its plans to annex Taiwan. Speaking today, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: The positions of the two countries on the most pressing international issues coincide or are close, which the Russian and Chinese leadership has repeatedly spoken about. She added that China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, and Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, did not discuss a reported Chinese plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement, Zakharova said: We note statements by some Western politicians and media reports regarding some kind of ‘Chinese peace plan’. As usual, they distort the real picture. She added: The Chinese partners briefed us on their views on the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis, as well as approaches to its political settlement. There was no talk of any separate plan Joe Biden and the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9) east European Nato allies “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine and underscored their shared commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes” according to a White House account of this afternoon’s meeting in Warsaw. The readout said the leaders “discussed the strengthened defensive posture on Nato’s eastern flank”. Nato has doubled its presence there over the past year, from four to eight multinational battle groups. There are 10,000 US soldiers now in Poland alone and the US has announced the establishment of a permanent base there, but the Poles and other east European leaders would have liked to see moves to build up eastern defences still further, ensuring a force that could repulse a Russian attack rather than simply acting as a tripwire. Further reinforcements are likely to be discussed at the Nato summit in Lithuania in July, when the leaders “looked forward to further strengthening alliance unity and collective defence”, according to the White House. President Joe Biden has now left the meeting with the Bucharest Nine (B9) in Warsaw, and boarded Air Force One, bringing an end to a historic trip to Ukraine and Poland ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sebastian Smith from AFP news agency writes that the American president stumbled as he climbed the stairs to his plane, before continuing up to the cabin. Two people have been killed in Russian shelling of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine today, according to regional officials. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the regional military administration, said an 81-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man were killed during shelling of the village of Novotyahinka, about 40 km (25 miles) from Kherson city. A Russian missile strike earlier today on the northeastern city of Kharkiv has also left two civilians wounded, Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will meet UN secretary general, António Guterres, to discuss ongoing support for Ukraine as the UN’s security council meets this week, the US state department has said. Blinken is expected to travel to New York tomorrow to attend the security council meeting on Ukraine, marking one year of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The pair will discuss the broad range of economic, security, and humanitarian support the US and other UN member states are continuing to provide to Ukraine, the state department said in a statement. In particular, they will discuss “the imperative to sustain and expand the Black Sea Grain Initiative as a vital means of addressing the global food security crisis”, it said. Subversive Slovenian industrial rock band Laibach are set to be the first foreign group to perform a full concert in Kyiv since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The group will play Bel Etage Music Hall on 31 March, under the concert title Eurovision – an arch reference to the fact the Eurovision song contest, won by Ukraine in 2022, will not be hosted in the country this year, but rather Liverpool in the UK. In a statement announcing the concert, the band said: While the rest of Europe prepares to celebrate its idea of freedom and solidarity on 9 May in Liverpool, Laibach is taking Eurovision back to Ukraine, where it belongs and where the only true and real vision of Europe is taking place right now. Proceeds from the concert will be donated to charity. Speaking to the Guardian via email as a group, they added: They say that while weapons speak, art is silent. We don’t agree with that. Some of the most important works of art and music were created during war. Even in the most unbearable times of holocaust, art gave meaning and power to life, to resist the violence of war. Read the full story here: All members of the Bucharest Nine (B9), the nations on Nato’s eastern flank, have jointly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, a Polish presidential adviser said. Leaders of the B9 have gathered for a meeting in Warsaw, along with President Joe Biden and Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. The Polish adviser told reporters: All allies agreed that they would support each other in the event of a threat. The next point of the declaration was the condemnation of the brutal, bloody war against Ukraine, which is being waged by Russia. All members of the Bucharest Nine signed these words. Fifteen minutes before midnight, a young Russian conscript named Danila, who had been sent to fight in Ukraine, picked up his phone to write a message to his family and friends back home in a small town in the Samara region. It was 31 December. “We congratulated each other, wished each other the best for the New Year, and then he was gone,” said a close friend who wrote with him that night. Minutes later, a US-made Himars rocket slammed into Professional Technical School No. 19 in Makiivka, a city in eastern Ukraine under Russian occupation. It took nearly 50 days for Danila’s remains to be identified beneath the rubble. His family spent weeks calling local hospitals and a military hotline, where they were told to wait for news that never seemed to come. The massive strike that killed at least 100 soldiers from a single Russian region, most of them mobilised to fight in Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, exhibits the tensions on the home front that have been stoked by the war, and how the Kremlin has dipped into a deep well of patriotism and propaganda to maintain its war effort despite the deaths of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers in the past year. The friend, who agreed to speak with the Guardian anonymously, described Danila, in his early 20s, as a welder who had worked for an uncle in Crimea before returning to his native Samara for the weekend and receiving a summons to go to war. As a self-professed patriot who said he would “never let Russia be occupied”, he did not try to dodge the draft. “When he got his call-up papers, he immediately said that he was going,” said the friend. “He said: ‘What am I, some bum or loser to run away from this? That means my fate is to be a soldier.’” Read the full story here: Joe Biden told leaders from the Bucharest Nine countries that the US would defend “every inch” of Nato. The US president spoke alongside leaders of the eastern European nations in Warsaw, reiterating US support for the alliance. He said not only Ukraine was at stake, but “freedom”. At the UN general assembly in New York, a debate is due to begin due on a Ukrainian-drafted resolution calling for a Russian withdrawal and a cessation of hostilities. The resolution, co-sponsored by at least 70 countries, is intended as an alternative to peace proposals for an immediate ceasefire that would lock in the territorial gains Russia has made from its invasion. It is the latest in a series of tests of strength at the UN general assembly, all of which Ukraine has won overwhelmingly. Ukrainian, US and European officials said they expected the resolution to win the support of over 130 of the 193 UN member states, with about 50 states abstaining, absenting themselves, or unable to vote due to unpaid UN membership dues. At a previous vote on the legality of the war in October, only Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria voted with Russia. The resolution reaffirms the UN body’s “commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders” It calls for Russia to “immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine” and for “a cessation of hostilities”. In particular it appeals for “an immediate cessation of the attacks on the critical infrastructure of Ukraine and any deliberate attacks on civilian objects, including those that are residences, schools, and hospitals.” The resolution also calls for legal accountability for war crimes “ensure justice for all victims and the prevention of future crimes.” It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

Russia’s parliament has approved Vladimir Putin’s move to suspend the New Start nuclear arms treaty.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you the latest from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. EU countries on Wednesday failed to agree on a new set of sanctions against Russia meant to be in place for the one-year anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Friday, four diplomatic sources in Brussels have told Reuters. “There are several issues outstanding, including on rubber and reporting obligations of Russian assets in Europe,” said one of the sources, who all spoke under condition of anonymity due to confidentiatlity of the negotiations among the 27 EU states. More talks among Brussels representatives of EU member countries were due on Thursday afternoon, said the sources. Russia’s embassy in London has published some quotes from ambassador to the UK Andrei Kelin’s interview with Al Arabiya News. In it, he says: The Kremlin is ready for peace talks at any moment. Peace talks started in April last year, but then the US and the UK decided that Ukraine should fight and they just stopped them, and the president of Ukraine has made a decree that there will not be peace talks at all. We cannot understand this. Ukraine has become a real danger for Russia. It has a big military potential, and we have to reduce this. The “special military operation will continue until its goals will be achieved. The common goal is to stop the discrimination and killing of Russians in Donbas. For eight years, the west chose not to see Kyiv regime’s hostilities against the Russia-speaking population in the east. Meanwhile, those people were being discriminated, shelled and killed. The frontline is now more or less stable, but we have to go further because Ukrainian armed forces continue to shell Donetsk. Kelin also spoke about the prospect of the west sending tanks and perhaps fighter jets to Ukraine. He told viewers “We have already destroyed all tanks that have been in Ukraine before. We have destroyed all tanks that have been sent from different countries. We are going to destroy new tanks when they arrive, as well as the jets.” The International Federation of Journalists said on Wednesday it had suspended the membership of Russia’s main journalism trade union after it established branches in occupied regions of Ukraine. “The IFJ is an organisation built on international solidarity, on principles of cooperation between member unions and respect for the rights of all journalists. The Russian Union of Journalists’ actions in establishing four branches in the annexed Ukrainian territories have clearly shattered this solidarity and sown divisions among sister unions,” the IFJ president, Dominique Pradalie, said in a statement, Reuters reported. The head of the Union of Russian Journalists told state news agency Tass that the move violated the IFJ’s charter and would hurt the world body financially because it would no longer receive substantial membership fees from Russia. Finland and Sweden are proceeding “hand-in-hand” towards Nato membership, the Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, said on Wednesday, but added that Turkey controlled the decision to ratify the applications for the two Nordic countries. “We proceed hand in hand in terms of the things that are in our own hands,” Reuters reports Niinisto told a joint news conference with the Swedish and Norwegian prime ministers, but added: “Ratification is not in our hands.” Klaus Iohannis, the president of Romania, has tweeted to say that today’s meeting “reconfirms the strength of our ‘Bucharest nine’ format”. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, told Vladimir Putin that Beijing will play a “constructive” role in reaching a political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine, Russian state-owned Tass news agency is reporting. Wang was quoted as saying: The Chinese side will, as in the past, firmly adhere to an objective and impartial position and play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis. In its readout of the meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang pledged to strengthen cooperation between the two countries. Wang told Putin that Beijing was willing to work with Russia to deepen political trust, extend pragmatic cooperation, and play a constructive role for both countries in promoting world peace and development, the Chinese ministry said. The Swiss government is seeking parliamentary approval to send 140m francs (£125m) in further humanitarian aid to Ukraine and Moldova, the government has said. Switzerland has already allocated 1.3bn francs to support Ukraine, including 270m francs to help people in the country and 1.03bn francs to support Ukrainians who have fled to Switzerland. The government said continued support was needed to improve the “precarious situation” of the people in Ukraine, where 40% of the population was reliant on aid. Foreign minister Ignazio Cassis, speaking at a news conference, said: In a humanitarian way, diplomatically, and with reconstruction in mind, we can support Ukraine. Most of the money - 114m francs - is earmarked for Ukraine, with 26m francs for Moldova. The aid envisaged includes shelters for schools, repairs to hospitals and energy infrastructure, or small loans to small agricultural businesses. Removal of mines and psychological and social support for the population are also among the projects which could be supported. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, spoke after Joe Biden, where he said he was “so pleased and so impressed” with the US president’s “outstanding leadership”. Biden’s visit to Kyiv sent a clear message of steadfast support to Ukraine and of the US's “ironclad commitment to the security of Europe”, Stoltenberg said. He said Vladimir Putin was “preparing for more war” and so Nato allies must sustain and step up support for Ukraine. “We must give Ukraine what they need to prevail,” he urged. Stoltenberg said: We don’t know when the war will end but when it does, we need to ensure that history does not repeat itself. We have seen Russian aggression over many years – Georgia in 2008, Crimea and Donbas in 2014, and then the full fledged invasion of Ukraine last year. We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression. Nato allies have never been more united. President Joe Biden has been speaking ahead of talks with leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9) and Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Biden says leaders of the B9 are the “frontlines” of Nato’s collective defence as well as “for the freedom of democracies through Europe and around the world”. He says the US has repeatedly stepped up to provide critical security assistance to Ukraine, and critical support to “literally millions” of refugees. Together we’ll continue our enduring support for Ukraine as they defend their freedom over the past year, with your countries around this table, providing collective leadership, He says it is “absolutely clear” that the US will defend “literally every inch of Nato”. President Joe Biden has said Vladimir Putin “made a mistake” by suspending the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. During his state-of-the-nation address yesterday, Putin declared that Moscow was suspending its participation in the 2010 New START treaty. The Russian leader said Moscow could not accept US inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its Nato allies have openly declared the goal of Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. Both houses of Russia’s parliament have now voted to suspend the treaty. In his first comments since Putin’s announcement, Biden condemned the Russian decision to pull back from the treaty. Joe Biden is now meeting the leaders of the Bucharest Nine (B9), a collection of nations on the most eastern parts of the Nato alliance and closest to Russia. The alliance includes Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Biden is wrapping up his four-day visit to Poland and Ukraine with talks with B9 leaders, where he will seek to reassure that the US is highly attuned to the looming threats and America’s ironclad commitment to the mutual-defence treaty. Many within the alliance worry that Vladimir Putin could move to take military action against them next if he is successful in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s appearance on stage at the rally at Moscow’s Luzhniki stadium only lasted a few minutes, but he did take the chance to issue a rallying cry for Russians to get behind the country’s armed forces fighting in Ukraine. The Russian leader praised soldiers who are “fighting heroically, courageously, bravely” to “defend the fatherland”, adding that the “whole country” supports them. He then led the crowd in chants of “Russia, Russia, Russia”. Vladimir Putin has met China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, to discuss cooperation between Beijing and Moscow. The Russian president also told Wang he was looking forward to a visit to Moscow by his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and to a deepening partnership between the two countries. Vladimir Putin has arrived at Luzhniki stadium in Moscow to take part in a rally marking one year of the war in Ukraine and “Defender of the Fatherland” Day. The Financial Times’ Max Seddon has been covering the performances at the event, as well as Putin’s speech. Nato must “seriously plan” for the likely future reality of a Russian-controlled Belarus, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has warned. Vladimir Putin will “very likely secure significant gains in restoring Russian suzerainty over Belarus” and use it as a launch pad to further threaten Ukraine and Nato’s eastern flank, regardless of the outcome of his invasion of Ukraine, the ISW said in its latest update on the war. It said: Russia’s likely permanent gains in Belarus present the west with a decision about how to deal with the potential future security landscape on Nato’s eastern flank. Russia’s federation council, the upper house of parliament, has approved Vladimir Putin’s move to suspend the New Start nuclear arms treaty, state media is reporting. The State Duma, Russia’s lower house, earlier also voted to approve the decision to suspend the pact – the country’s last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US. Putin announced the suspension in a major national address yesterday, claiming that Moscow could not accept US inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its allies have openly declared the goal of Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. Women in Ukraine are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence 12 months after Russia invaded the country, with reports of abuse on the rise, according to a leading humanitarian organisation in the country. Women fleeing from bombed houses and their home towns are reporting attacks occurring in the home and in communal shelters, said Marysia Zapasnik, Ukraine country director for the International Rescue Committee. “We are noticing higher levels of gender-based violence that is related to displacement,” she said. So support networks are not there and levels of stress among all members of the community, unfortunately, sometimes manifests itself in gender-based violence. So in collective shelters we’re noticing higher levels of that, as well as having cases referred to us. The IRC is currently focusing its relief efforts in the east and south-east of Ukraine where there is heavy shelling and fighting. It estimates that 17.6 million people in the country are in urgent need of humanitarian aid, while 6 million have been internally displaced. Zapasnik gave a recent example of a woman who was attacked in a collective shelter and fled, grabbing only her handbag and a jumper. After being found by police wandering the streets in her slippers, she was referred to the IRC which provided psychological support, money to buy clothes and organised access to a safe house. Zapasnik said sexual violence and domestic abuse were increasing. “High levels of stress tend to increase levels domestic violence as well,” she said. It’s a very sensitive topic and it’s something that that wasn’t discussed in Ukraine before the war so it is hard to discuss openly. We need to make sure that we do everything we can to protect women, including those that we’re working with.

India does not want the G20 nations to discuss additional sanctions on Russia during its one-year presidency of the bloc, according to officials. Six senior Indian government officials have told Reuters that the macroeconomic impact of the war in Ukraine would be discussed in this week’s G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs, but that India does not want to deliberate on additional actions against Russia. One of the officials said: India is not keen to discuss or back any additional sanctions on Russia during the G20. The existing sanctions on Russia have had a negative impact on the world. On Tuesday, Japan’s finance minister said financial leaders of the G7 nations would meet tomorrow, on the sidelines of the G20 gathering in India, to discuss measures against Russia. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government has not openly criticised Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and instead called for dialogue and diplomacy to end the war. India has also sharply raised purchases of oil from Russia, its biggest supplier of defence hardware. During his meeting with Vladimir Putin, Wang Yi said “a crisis is always an opportunity” with regard to the international situation and said that the Sino-Russian relationship was “never dictated by any third parties”. Both leaders emphasised the importance of “multipolar” approaches to international affairs – a worldview that rejects what China describes as the United States’ “unipolar” approach to dominating global leadership. China’s top diplomat Wang Yi met Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, in Moscow on Wednesday as China and Russia reaffirmed their close bilateral relationship ahead of the one year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In brief televised remarks Wang said that China and Russia were ready to deepen their strategic cooperation. Earlier in the day Wang met Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, where he said he expects to reach a “new consensus” on advancing the relationship between the two allies. Putin said that “Russian Chinese relations were proceeding as planned” and talked of reaching “new milestones” in areas such as bilateral trade. Putin also said that the two countries had “ongoing cooperation” in international affairs and expressed Russia’s gratitude to China. Putin described the international situation as “quite complicated” and said that Sino-Russian cooperation was “important for stabilising the international situation”. Spain plans to send six 2A4 Leopard tanks to Ukraine, defence minister Margarita Robles has been quoted as telling lawmakers. That number could increase over time, she said. We are repairing right now six Leopard 2A4 vehicles ... with the possibility - if needed and if our allies request it - of increasing that number. Robles said last month that Spain was open to sending German-made Leopard tanks and would act in coordination with its western allies, after Germany agreed to send the tanks and said Nato allies could do the same. Spain has 108 2A4 tanks, according to security and defence researcher Felix Arteaga of the Elcano thinktank. About half of Spain’s tanks are in its north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and 53 are mothballed at a military base in Zaragoza and would need to be refitted, he said. Belgium has said it is investigating a Russian “spy ship” detected in the North Sea around mid-November last year. The ship was detected in the Belgian North Sea around mid-November last year, Vincent Van Quickenborne, the Belgian justice and North Sea minister, said in a statement headlined “Russian spy ship off our coast in November”. While the presence of Russian ships in the North Sea is not forbidden, Belgium said it was monitoring the situation closely, in the context of the war in Ukraine. Van Quickenborne said: We don’t know the exact motives of this Russian ship, but let’s not be naive. Especially if it behaves suspiciously close to our wind farms, undersea gas and data cables and other critical infrastructure. It comes after Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD said Russia has been attempting to gain intelligence to sabotage critical infrastructure in the Dutch part of the North Sea. A Russian ship was detected at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea as it tried to map out energy infrastructure, MIVD head General Jan Swillens said at a news conference on Monday. Meanwhile in Moscow, thousands of people are gathering at Luzhniki stadium for a rally-concert marking one year of the war and the “Defenders of the Fatherland” Day. Vladimir Putin is expected to attend and speak later. The New York Times’ Valerie Hopkins is at the stadium: The Moscow Times reports that a governmental institution forced 70% of its workers to go to today’s pro-war rally, where organisers have also promised to distribute hot meals and Russian flags to attendees. The paper quotes one state employee as saying: To be honest, I think it’s absurd. We have to go and there’s nothing we can do with it. The authorities are using it as a propaganda tool to show off in the eyes of Z-patriots and those who watch TV. I wouldn’t go to the event voluntarily. As we reported, Vladimir Putin is meeting China’s top diplomat Wang Yi in Moscow. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, had earlier confirmed the Russian leader’s meeting with Wang. Wang also met with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, earlier today where he said he looked forward to clinching new agreements during his visit. Wang, speaking through an interpreter, said: I am ready to exchange views with you, my dear friend, on issues of mutual interest, and I look forward to reaching new agreements. He added: No matter how the international situation changes, China has been and remains committed, together with Russia, to make efforts to preserve the positive trend in the development of relations between major powers. He added that he would work to “strengthen and deepen” relations between Moscow and Beijing. President Vladimir Putin is meeting the top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi, in Moscow, according to pictures. The pair were pictured sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, as shared by the BBC’s Stephen McDonell. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over the Russia-Ukraine war live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Vladimir Putin’s threat to suspend Russian participation in New Start, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US, represents a blatant attempt to divide American opinion over the war on Ukraine by raising the specter of nuclear armageddon, experts and policymakers warned on Tuesday. Putin announced his intention to halt participation in the agreement towards the end of a belligerent 100-minute speech in which he charged the US and western powers with trying to inflict “strategic defeat” on Russia. His fiery rhetoric prompted instant reaction across the political spectrum in Washington. Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who was a Russian specialist at the White House National Security Council from 2017 to 2019, told the Guardian that Putin was “playing to the rifts in the United States”. The strategy was to increase political discord in an attempt to embolden calls for an end to US support for Ukraine. She said: It’s playing to all those people who want Ukraine to surrender and capitulate to avoid a massive nuclear exchange and world war three, a kind of nuclear armageddon. Thomas Graham, Russia director within George W Bush’s National Security Council, agreed that part of Putin’s calculation was to provoke “certain circles in the US to wonder whether the risks of supporting Ukraine are worth it”. Read the full story by Ed Pilkington and J Oliver Conroy: Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, reported that two people have been injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv on Wednesday morning. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said a shopping mall has been struck by Ukrainian fire in the Russian town of Shebekino, severely injuring one person. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the United Nations this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said. Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration also said he wanted the ports of Mykolaiv included in the deal, and that Russia’s current occupation of the Kinburn spit as an obstacle. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. A group of 10 EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The 10 countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the United Nations’ behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the United Nations nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is occupied by Russian forces. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. I am handing you over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Anton Gerashchenko, who is former deputy minister in the internal affairs department of Ukraine, and currently acts as an adviser, has suggested in a post on Telegram that Ukraine should work with Moldova to restore territorial integrity to the latter. In a post he tagged “my opinion”, Geraschenko said: If the people of Moldova and the authorities decide to restore territorial integrity, then with the support of Nato and Ukraine, this can be done in 24 hours. Now Moldova has a unique geopolitical and historical chance to gain independence from Russia. The separatist enclave of Transnistria, which exists solely due to the support of the Russian Federation, has been “sandwiched” between Moldova and Ukraine for a year now. Moldova needs to muster up the courage and, with the support of Nato allies and Ukraine, to restore its territorial integrity, using all available methods for this. Thus, Chișinău, instead of Kyiv, should end the 30-year history of mockery of Moldovan independence. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has posted to Telegram to say that a shopping mall has been struck in the Russian town of Shebekino. He wrote: The shelling of Shebekino. Shells hit the mall, causing it to catch fire. According to preliminary data, there is one victim. A man with shrapnel wounds was taken to the Central district hospital. Doctors assess his condition as extremely serious. All necessary assistance is provided. Operational services are on site, rescuers have begun extinguishing [the fire]. Ukraine will ask Turkey and the United Nations this week to start talks to roll over the Black Sea grain deal, seeking an extension of at least one year that would include the ports of Mykolaiv, a senior Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. The Black Sea grain initiative brokered by the UN and Turkey last July allowed grain to be exported from three Ukrainian ports. The agreement was extended in November and will expire on 18 March unless an extension is agreed. “A formal proposal will come out from us this week on the need to work on an extension,” Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of restoration, told Reuters in an interview. He said the exact date of the talks, which have previously taken place in Turkey, had not yet been set. “We will request … to extend it not for 120 days but for at least one year because the Ukrainian and global agricultural market needs to be able to plan these volumes in the long term,” Vaskov said. He said Ukraine would insist on an increase in the number of inspection teams “in order to eliminate the accumulation of vessels waiting for inspections”. Vaskov said Mykolaiv’s ports, which accounted for 35% of Ukrainian food exports before the Russian invasion, were ready to join the initiative and would need a maximum of two weeks to start operations. He said Kyiv did not see Russia’s occupation of the Kinburn spit as an obstacle to adding Mykolaiv’s ports to an extended deal. The spit of land overlooks the route that ships would use to sail from Mykolaiv’s ports into the Black Sea. “If the ports (of Mykoliav) are included in the initiative, there will be an obligation not to attack ships carrying agricultural products, which can work even in the current situation,” Vaskov said. Pope Francis, speaking two days before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on Wednesday called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations, saying no victory could be “built on ruins”. Francis, who has appealed for an end to violence in Ukraine at nearly every public appearance since Russia’s invasion of the country on 24 February 2022, spoke at his weekly general audience at the Vatican. “It has been a year since the start of this absurd and cruel war, a sad anniversary,” he said. “The number of dead, wounded, refugees and displaced people, the destruction and economic and social damage speak for themselves,” Francis said. Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andrii Yurash, attended the audience along with a delegation of Ukrainian officials. “May the Lord forgive so many crimes and so much violence. He is the God of peace. Let us remain close to the martyred Ukrainian people who continue to suffer,” Reuters reports Francis said. A group of ten EU member states have called for stronger action to stop Russia sourcing military parts through front companies in neighbouring countries and evading western sanctions. The ten countries, which include France, Germany, Italy and the Baltic states, write that “2023 must be the year of success in countering circumvention”, warning that public support and international legitimacy of sanctions could wane if they are deemed ineffective. In an informal paper the group argues that special attention should be given to western components used in Russian weaponry and military equipment, parts that are not easily replaced and could disrupt Russia’s military production if they were to disappear. They write: We see that Russia is transitioning into a full-on military economy with a view to sustaining its war efforts. Alternative supply chains are created through the use of front companies and intermediates in the circle of countries around Russia. Special focus should be put on western components that are crucial to the Russian military industry. A small disruption of these production chains therefore quickly has a significant impact in the Russian ability to produce weapons and military equipment. The recommendations include: Better cooperation between national and EU authorities, to ensure good information sharing between customs, tax authorities, prosecutors and intelligence. Better information sharing between national capitals and Brussels. Issuing warnings to individuals and companies in non-EU countries helping Russia evade sanctions that their help for Moscow risks “severe consequences for their access to the internal market”. Diplomatic coordination on how to deal with non-EU countries helping Russia evade sanctions. Creating a watchlist of companies and sectors of concern to raise awareness. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has urged member states to speed up delivery of ammunition from their stocks to Ukraine “as a matter or urgency”. Building on comments at the Munich Security conference over the weekend and at Nato headquarters on Tuesday, Borrell said the EU was” looking into the question of joint procurement” of ammunition and “how to ramp up the production capacity of the European defence industry”. In a letter to EU defence ministers seen by the Guardian, he promised proposals ahead of a meeting in Stockholm on 7-8 March. The European Commission intends to reimburse member states for ammunition sent to Ukraine and carry out joint procurement through the European Peace Facility, an EU military fund. The EPF has released €3.6bn to pay for military equipment for Ukraine over the last twelve months. Borrell writes “As a matter of urgency, I call on all of you to speed up the delivery of ammunition that you could provide from your stocks… The future of Ukraine is at stake.” Just a few miles from the Ukraine’s southern frontline, Russian missiles have been pummelling a village near Zaporizhzhia, and turned a newly refurbished medical clinic into a ravaged, abandoned shell. The Guardian’s Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry meet civilians who have refused to flee the bombardment and troops who are determined to fight back. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv region, has posted to Telegram to report that two people have been injured in Russian strikes on the city of Kharkiv this morning, where there have been reports of at least four explosions being heard. He wrote: According to preliminary data, ‘arrivals’ were recorded in Kharkiv. Infrastructure objects were in the sights of the occupiers. According to the regional centre of emergency medical assistance, two people were injured. They are in a light condition and are being treated by specialists. Early reports seem to indicate there have been at least four explosions in Kharkiv this morning so far. Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reports its correspondents in Kharkiv have heard explosions. Several people have posted to social media to note the same. Denis Pushilin, who is the leader of the occupied Donetsk region which Russia claims to have annexed, has posted a message to the Telegram app warning citizens that he anticipates increased Ukrainian military activity as the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of approaches. He told residents: Dear friends, we know from experience that the enemy is always active on anniversaries. There is information that in the next two-three days shelling by Ukrainian armed forces will intensify. Our artillery units are engaged in active battery and counter-battery combat, air defence is in an enhanced mode. Nevertheless, please be careful, do not move around the streets without unnecessary need. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plans to attend in person a Nato summit taking place in Vilnius in July, Ukraine’s ambassador to Lithuania told local newswire BNS. Reuters reports the Lithuania presidential office has said the Vilnius summit on 11-12 July will be attended by most leaders of the Atlantic alliance, including the US president, Joe Biden. “That is our plan,” ambassador Petro Beshta said about the Zelenskiy visit in an interview with BNS published on Wednesday. Zelenskiy has made only two foreign trips since Russia invaded Ukraine almost a year ago – one to Washington in December and another to London, Paris and Brussels in February. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports that in an unspecified number of regions in Russia, some commercial radio stations broadcast air raid alerts as a result of a cyber-attack. Tass reports the Russian emergencies ministry issued the following statement: The ministry of emergency situations of Russia reports that this information is fake and does not correspond to reality. We kindly ask you to follow the messages in official sources. Tass reports the department added that as a result of a hacker attack on the servers of some commercial radio stations in several regions, information about the alleged announcement of an air raid alert and the threat of a missile strike was broadcast. During the last twelve months Russia has claimed that targets within Russia, most usually in the Kursk and Belgorod regions which border Ukraine, have been struck by fire from inside Ukraine. Russia on Wednesday expressed “deep concern” over the United Nations’ behaviour regarding the rotation of staff at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Reuters reports that in a statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said the United Nations nuclear body was “disrupting” the scheduled changeover of IAEA staff stationed at the plant, which is under the control of Russian forces, without good reason. Russian officials on Wednesday continued to blame the US and the west for President Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend Moscow’s participation in the New Start treaty, as Russia’s parliament looked set to rubber-stamp the move. Reuters reports ex-president Dmitry Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of the Russian security council, said the move was a “long overdue” response to the US and Nato in effect declaring war on Russia. “This decision was forced on us by the war declared by the US and other Nato countries on our country. It will have a huge resonance in the world overall and in the United States in particular,” Medvedev said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. The head of Russia’s Duma, the lower house of parliament, also blamed the US for the breakdown. “By ceasing to comply with its obligations and rejecting our country’s proposals on global security issues, the US destroyed the architecture of international stability,” Vyacheslav Volodin said in a statement. My colleague Peter Beaumont reports that air raid sirens are sounding again in Kyiv. Here are some images that have been sent over the news wires from Russian-oocupied Mariupol in southern Ukraine. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. While the foreign ministry has said it would continue abiding by the treaty’s restrictions, a suspension of the treaty may mean that it will be harder for the US to monitor compliance. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts say it would be a serious blow if Putin went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments. John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, said in an interview with the Washington Post that the move is “entirely symbolic”. He believes that Putin made the announcement to pressure Biden into approaching Russia about ending the war, “so Russia can dictate the terms under which that would happen”. In a speech ahead of the upcoming one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New Start. Signed by then US president Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, in 2010, the New Start treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy. Together, the US and Russia own 90% of the world’s nuclear weapons. In this context, “deploy” means ready for immediate use, rather than have in storage. Weapons kept in storage are “non-deployed”. According to an explainer of the treaty written by the EU parliament, “Warheads count as deployed if loaded onto a missile that is itself deployed”. Under the agreement, Moscow and Washington are committed to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and a maximum of 700 long-range missiles and bombers. Each side can conduct up to 18 inspections of strategic nuclear weapons sites every year to ensure the other has not breached the treaty’s limits. The treaty came into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five more years after Joe Biden took office. Russia’s flagship frigate equipped with new generation hypersonic cruise missiles has arrived in the South African port of Richards Bay for exercises that will include China, Russia’s RIA state news agency reported on Wednesday. South Africa was due to launch the joint exercises on Friday. It calls the drills routine but they have fuelled domestic criticism and fears they could endanger relations with western partners. The beginning of the exercises coincides with the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and follows Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to suspend its last major nuclear arms control treaty with the United States The ship, named “The Admiral Gorshkov of the Fleet of the Soviet Union”, had arrived at Richards Bay “performing the tasks of a long-range voyage”, RIA reported, citing a statement from the Russian Northern Fleet. The Gorshkov warship, which was sent off from Russia on 4 January, carries the Zircon missiles which have a range of 900 km (560 miles) and can travel at several times the speed of sound, making it difficult to defend against them. In late January, the ship tested its strike capabilities in the western Atlantic Ocean. The UN general assembly meets today, two days ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Kyiv and its allies hoping to garner broad support for a resolution calling for a “just and lasting peace.” The draft resolution, sponsored by 60 countries, is to be voted on after the close of debate – not expected until at least Thursday. The text “underscores the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.” Like previous resolutions, it reaffirms the UN’s “commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine” and calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Russia’s first criminal case against a member of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, accused of forcibly seizing power and ill-treatment of civilians, has gone to court, the state TASS news agency reported on Wednesday. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on the Telegram messaging platform in June that it had charged Senior Sergeant Anton Cherednik of the Marine Corps of Ukraine’s forces with the alleged crime of cruel treatment of civilian population. TASS, citing unnamed sources at the Southern District Military Court in Russia’s Rostov-on-Don, said that Cherednik was also charged with murder and training for the purpose of carrying out terrorism. Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports and the charges. TASS said the court will consider the case “in the near future. More now on Biden’s meeting today with the Bucharest Nine. Most members of the group – made up of the countries on Nato’s eastern flank who joined the western military alliance after being dominated by Moscow during the cold war – are strong supporters of military aid to Ukraine, and officials from countries in the group have called for additional resources such as air defence systems. At the meeting, Biden plans to reaffirm commitments over their security and discuss support for Ukraine before he returns to Washington. Russia regards Nato, which could soon expand to include Sweden and Finland, as an existential threat. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda’s message to Biden will be that it wants “greater involvement of the US in Europe, Nato’s eastern flank and, of course, more aid to Ukraine,” his chief foreign policy adviser told Lithuanian radio on Tuesday. “Lithuania and other like-minded countries have several requests, which concern air defence, forward defence presence, air defence systems, and greater investments in the defence industry,” Asta Skaisgiryte said. The former Soviet republic on Russia’s doorstep joined Nato in 2004 and plans to host Biden in July for the security alliance’s leaders’ summit. As the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches on Friday, the picture looks very different to the first weeks of the war, when hundreds of Russian tanks poured over the border and airborne forces attempted to capture Hostomel airfield, outside Kyiv, as a springboard to take the capital. Here we look at the status of the conflict and what might happen next. There are different ways to assess who is winning the war. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is close to achieving its stated war aims, which in Ukraine’s case involves liberating all occupied territory. It is probably safe to say that the current trajectory of the conflict is going much better for Ukraine than for Russia – and that the continuing influx of new weapons from the west will maintain that trajectory. But Ukraine, as the EU’s head of foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, warned recently, is heavily dependent on the west for arms, including artillery ammunition, which has exposed a potential vulnerability for Kyiv in the east, where artillery has dominated the battles. What is also unclear is how much of a gamechanger weapons such as main battle tanks are likely to be in bringing the war towards a close, or how quickly. So for now, the war grinds on. Read more on where things stand here: Kazakhstan may send the first batch of oil via Russia’s Druzhba pipeline to Germany in the coming days, possibly on Wednesday, Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Kazakhstan’s Energy Minister Bolat Akchulakov as saying on Wednesday. “I really hope that it will go today,” Akchulakov said. Kazakh supplies are meant to replace those of Russian crude that the European Union pledged to stop buying as part of wider sanctions prompted by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline remains exempt from sanctions, but Germany’s refineries in Leuna and Schwedt - which are connected to the pipeline - have not ordered any Russian crude for this year. Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking region wedged between the Dniester River and the Ukraine border. It seceded from Moldova after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1992, the separatists fought a war with Moldova’s pro-western government, which ended in hundreds of deaths and the intervention of the Russian army on the rebels’ side. In a 2006 referendum that was not recognised by the international community, 97.1% of voters backed joining Russia, dealing a blow to Moldova’s hopes of following Romania and other ex-communist eastern European states into the EU. Transnistria is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot. Moldova’s president, Maia Sandu, has made clear her opposition to Transnistria’s secession. She wants Russian troops stationed along Transnistria’s frontier with Moldova to be replaced with an observer mission from the Organisation for Security and cooperation in Europe, a proposal rejected by Moscow. More on Transnistria here: The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has said Moscow’s military chiefs are refusing to supply the group with munitions and are seeking to destroy it, accusing them of “treason”, in an escalation of the war of words between senior Russian officials and the private army boss. Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenary force, which has recruited from prisons across Russia to bolster its ranks, is playing a key role in the efforts to capture the city of Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east. The battle has exposed tensions between the Wagner group and the Russian army, though the Kremlin denies any rift. “[Moscow’s] chief of general staff and the defence minister give out orders left and right not only to not give ammunition to PMC Wagner, but also to not help it with air transport,” Prigozhin said in a voice message shared by his press service on Tuesday. “There is just direct opposition going on, which is nothing less than an attempt to destroy Wagner. This can be equated to high treason,” he added. Russia’s defence ministry has denied limiting ammunition shipments to volunteers at the front, but made no mention of the Wagner group private army or of Prigozhin’s accusations. “All requests for ammunition for assault units are met as soon as possible,” it insisted, promising new deliveries on Saturday and denouncing as “absolutely false” reports of shortages. “Attempts to create a split within the close mechanism of interaction and support between units of the Russian [fighting] groups are counter-productive and work solely to the benefit of the enemy,” the statement read: Putin has revoked a 2012 decree that in part underpinned Moldova’s sovereignty in resolving the future of the Transdniestria region – a Moscow-backed separatist region which borders Ukraine and where Russia keeps troops. The decree, which included a Moldova component, outlined Russia’s foreign policy 11 years ago which assumed Moscow’s closer relations with the European Union and the United States. The order revoking the 2012 document was published on the Kremlin’s website and states that the decision was taken to “ensure the national interests of Russia in connection with the profound changes taking place in international relations”. It is part of a series of anti-western moves announced by Putin on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden is still in Poland, where he will meet with leaders of the so-called “Bucharest Nine” countries, Nato’s eastern European members, and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg. The Bucharest Nine, or B9, was formed in 2015 in response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. Its members are Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia. Biden is expected to return to Washington on Wednesday evening. On Tuesday he delivered a speech in Warsaw in which he rallied the allies, saying, “When Russia invaded, it wasn’t just Ukraine being tested. The whole world faced a test for the ages.” Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Coming up today: US President Joe Biden is in Warsaw, Poland, where he will meet with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and the ‘Bucharest Nine’ nations, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovakia. And Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin launched two verbal attacks against top brass on Tuesday, accusing them of depriving his Wagner fighters of munitions in what he called a treasonous attempt to destroy his private military company. More on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments: Ukraine told schools on Tuesday to hold classes remotely from 22-24 February because of the risk of Russian missile strikes around the first anniversary of Moscow’s 2022 invasion. Speaking before a crowd of thousands in the gardens of Warsaw’s Royal Castle, Joe Biden hailed the resilience of Ukraine’s people and the benevolence of Poland and other western allies in helping fend off the Russian invasion. The US president said the attack on Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, and said new sanctions against Russia will be announced this week. The foreign ministers of the G7 have said their countries would continue to impose economic costs on Russia and urged the broader international community to reject what they described as Moscow’s “brutal expansionism”. Russian president Vladimir Putin has given a long televised national address to the joint houses of the Russian parliament, in which he blamed the west for starting the war in Ukraine and promised a new fund to help those who had lost loved ones in what he referred to as Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine. Putin also announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of warheads it could have deployed. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said he regretted Russia’s decision to suspend its participation in the New Start bilateral nuclear arms control treaty and urged Moscow to reconsider. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces were maintaining their positions on the frontline in the east after Russia reported it was advancing on its main target in the area. Russia, trying to secure full control of two eastern provinces forming Ukraine’s Donbas industrial region, has launched repeated assaults, securing its biggest gains around the mining city of Bakhmut. Eighteen Russian MPs are expected to attend a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna on Friday, the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and have been invited to a nationalist ball."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T13:55:49Z","webTitle":"Energy makes the headlines, but reset on diplomacy is Albanese’s real power play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/dec/09/energy-makes-the-headlines-but-reset-on-diplomacy-is-albaneses-real-power-play","fields":{"bodyText":"For weeks, all eyes have been on soaring energy prices, and what the governments of Australia will do to give households and businesses relief. Governments answered part of the national water cooler question on Friday, agreeing to new price caps for coal and gas, and to rebates for people on low and middle incomes. The impact of the proposed price caps seems clear. Power bills will increase, but they will be lower than they otherwise would be in the absence of government intervention. Consumer rebates are still a bit of a work in progress, requiring final agreement between the treasurer Jim Chalmers and his state counterparts. While energy has dominated the headlines since October, other important policy conundrums are gathering speed as we stagger towards the summer break. The Albanese government has been pushing ahead in diplomacy, security and in defence policy. This week, Labor’s Clare O’Neil reset key priorities in the national security portfolio most associated with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton – home affairs. During a speech to the National Press Club, O’Neil, the current home affairs minister made it clear she would retire the made-for-2GB-mantras of stop the boats and bad bikies. Replacing them? A sharper focus on cyber security, a new civics and social cohesion program to address misinformation and threats to democracy, and greater coordination around the natural disasters intensified by the climate crisis. While O’Neil was hosing out hoary chestnuts from home affairs, the defence minister Richard Marles and the foreign minister Penny Wong met their counterparts in the United States. This week’s “Ausmin” discussion in Washington hung a lantern over the growing US military presence in Australia. The talks this week also moved Australia closer to operationalising the Aukus nuclear submarine pact, while working through how to solve the yawning capability gap that exists in the interim. Let’s open with a Saturday morning mind bender about Aukus. Readers: do we think the Albanese government would have initiated the Aukus agreement if Anthony Albanese and Co had been in government during the last parliamentary term? I think about this sliding doors question periodically. It’s interesting to me, because I don’t know the answer. Sometimes I think it must be no. Other times, I think, given the dangerous state of the world, all roads lead all Australian governments to an Indo-Pacific nuclear submarine junction. While we are playing hypothetical, it’s important to be clear. Labor did have an opportunity to say no to Aukus back in opposition. Albanese did not have to endorse Morrison’s plan. Paul Keating counselled against it. But the political risk of resistance was high. With an election bearing down, Morrison was absolutely desperate to create a point of difference with his political opponents – so desperate that he ultimately escalated and branded Marles a “Manchurian candidate” in the parliament. This conduct was so unbecoming Canberra’s intelligence establishment emerged from the shadows and rebuked Morrison in plain sight. So we know what happened. Labor said yes to Aukus, which draws Australia ever deeper into the military complex of the US. As well as the rolling to-and-fro about Aukus, this week Australian ministers in Washington agreed to “preposition stores, munitions, and fuel in support of US capabilities in Australia” and agreed to “increase rotations of our air, land and sea forces”. The general atmospherics of the week suggest the Albanese government is journeying deeper down the US integration path with few, if any, qualms. But I’d caution readers against a one-dimensional reading of events. A reading that says the Albanese government, in a brain dead partisan risk aversion trance, is all the way with Uncle Sam, does miss an important nuance. Australia is absolutely saddling up with the US – a choice that was made long before we entered the current era of Chinese militarism and nationalism. Australia made this choice years before we could see the possibility of a military conflagration over Taiwan. But that doesn’t mean Australia isn’t hedging our bets. If we look past the razzle dazzle of Ausmin and Aukus to the looming defence strategic review, the important nuance comes into focus. This arms-length review, established by Albanese and Marles, and reporting early next year, is an exercise in establishing whether or not Australia can defend itself in light of current threats. The process is examining defence force structure, posture and preparedness. It will consider what sort of investments Australia should make if we want to be able to defend the country against sudden lethal aggression. At one level, the policy question the review asks is entirely routine. All responsible governments make provision to defend their territory against hostile incursions. Governments also adjust those plans in the light of evolving threats, and expert assessments of the capability of adversaries. But given Australia sits under the military umbrella of the US, and given the government seems to be walking even further down that road, why is the same government asking a pointed policy question that goes right to the heart of our national sovereignty? Here’s a theory. Perhaps the government is asking that question because we can no longer fully rely on the US to be a reliable security partner. Now don’t get me wrong. Joe Biden has certainly revived the US as a responsible global citizen that respects the value of alliances. But how long is Biden there? How long before the reactionaries break back? The resurgence of populist isolationism in the US casts a long shadow across world. If I were Albanese, I’d want insurance against the whims of Donald Trump 2.0, or Ron DeSantis – or whomever. In an interesting interview with the Australian back in November, Albanese was direct about his intentions. He said Australia needed missiles, and drones, and enhanced cyber capabilities. He flagged increasing Australian military capability within five years. He said he wanted the strategic review to provide advice about the optimal means of self defence. More than this, Albanese said Australia needed to “project force” – quite the declaration from a life-long leftwinger from inner-city Sydney. The moral of the story this weekend is things are generally more complicated than they look. Australia is going further into the US military complex, while hedging our bets. And if we look to defence’s policy companion, diplomacy, we see mirrored complexity. Over the past six months, the Albanese government has managed to stabilise the relationship with Beijing. This has happened because China has chosen to resume open diplomacy, and because Labor has sought to lower the temperature in the theatre of domestic politics. This relational reset with China has happened at the same time as the government has made our increasing integration with the US more explicit. It’s also coincided with a Wong-led soft-power offensive in the Pacific which is all about repelling Chinese influence. Australia has turbo-charged diplomacy while simultaneously signalling our inclination to strengthen deterrence. These two objectives are superficially contradictory, but as Marles put it in a speech earlier this year: “The idea that Australia has to choose between diplomacy and defence – or, as some critics would have it, between cooperation and confrontation – is a furphy, and a dangerous one at that”. So where does all this leave us? The simple answer is in a quantifiably different place to the past three years, where foreign and defence policy was very often crafted as a kabuki play for a domestic audience. When a government’s international statecraft is tuned for the TV news and talkback radio, to amplify intra-day partisan messaging, things are simple. There are goodies and baddies, and heroes and villains; rinse and repeat. The change of government has reset the terrain. We are now back to Australia prosecuting foreign and defence policy for its own ends, in a dangerous world. The cross-currents will be strong enough at times to feel a bit scary, and a bit confusing. But it’s all pretty interesting. I recommend we all fasten our seat belts, secure our tray tables, and watch how our fate in the region is reshaped over the next 12 months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T19:59:17Z","webTitle":"Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","fields":{"bodyText":"Iran has enriched uranium particles up to just short of weapons grade, placing further pressure on western powers to issue a third censure of Iran at a meeting of the nuclear watchdog board next week. In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-30T07:30:42Z","webTitle":"Escape from Model Land by Erica Thompson review – the power and pitfalls of prediction ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/dec/30/escape-from-model-land-by-erica-thompson-review-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-prediction","fields":{"bodyText":"“The only function of economic forecasting,” wrote the great American economist John Kenneth Galbraith, “is to make astrology look respectable.” It is characteristic of Erica Thompson’s sprightly and highly original new book on the uses and abuses of mathematical modelling that she dares to turn Galbraith’s verdict on its head. The medieval practice of casting horoscopes, she shows in one typically engaging section that embodies her most important themes, has a surprising amount to teach us about the modern practice of using models to guide policy. The topic is an exceptionally important and timely one. The Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and turbulence in financial markets are just three examples of how fundamental mathematical modelling has become to decision-making in many areas of modern life. Thompson’s argument is not, of course, that scientific forecasting has made no progress over the past half-millennium. Today’s researchers benefit from a world awash with data on natural phenomena and human behaviour, making the raw material for model-building vastly richer than it once was. Mathematical and statistical techniques are far more sophisticated – and we have modern computing power to help us crunch the numbers. These differences make the artificial worlds which modern economists, meteorologists and epidemiologists build dramatically more hi-res than anything the benighted court astrologer could come up with. But just like their medieval counterparts, today’s “Model Lands” – the hypothetical worlds we construct in order to explore the future – have no practical value until their analyses and predictions are applied in real life. It is in this all-important step – the escape of Thompson’s title – that the parallels between astrology and mathematical modelling become particularly relevant. The central common challenge is working out how much of what we learn in pristine but artificial models remains valid in messy but concrete real life. One way of figuring this out is quantitative: you compare the predictions of the model against new, incoming data. A critical obstacle here is that predictions based on modern mathematical models, no less than those based on medieval horoscopes, usually depend on an extensive hinterland of assumptions. That makes testing the validity of their forecasts intrinsically difficult: were the assumptions wrong, or was it just that not enough assumptions were included? Another problem is that the fresh, real-world data needed to test the results is often not even available. It will flood in quickly and easily for day-ahead weather forecasts, for example – but might arrive centuries too late to discriminate between today’s long-term climate models. That’s why, Thompson explains, a second, qualitative way of determining the success of predictions is much more common: reliance on expert judgment. The pitfalls of this route were also well known to the medieval courts. Only those versed in the most cutting-edge mathematical knowledge were skilled enough to interpret medieval horoscopes. As such, it was in practice impossible for the client to come to their own conclusions. The result was that an exclusive guild, whose true competence remained unknown, ended up marking their own homework. The same could be said today. Another hazard stalking ancient and modern modellers alike is that they fall in love with the sheer beauty and complexity of their own constructions. Having eaten the lotuses of Model Land, they can’t bring themselves to escape. Scenarios and predictions are simply accepted as if the model actually is real life. “Such naive Model Land realism,” Thompson warns, “can have catastrophic effects because it invariably results in an underestimation of uncertainties and exposure to greater-than-expected risk.” Anyone who remembers Goldman Sachs’s chief financial officer blaming the global credit crunch of 2007 on the occurrence of “twenty-five standard deviation events, several days in a row” knows what Thompson is getting at. If it couldn’t happen in the model, it just wasn’t meant to happen in real life. It’s not all bad news. Thompson is a data scientist and mathematical modeller herself, and her book is far from an exercise in model-bashing. It is instead a nuanced and constructive critique of what remains an invaluable analytical method – just not necessarily for the reasons you might expect. For example, even though the astrologers’ models of natural forces and human behaviour were wrong, the practice of casting horoscopes could still be a useful aid to policymaking. They brought systematic thinkers into the orbit of otherwise impulsive rulers; it allowed the discussion of important, otherwise taboo subjects in the safe context of interpreting the stars; and it could give decision-makers the public narrative they needed in order to act. The same applies today. As Thompson shows, mathematical model-building can still be a constructive tool, even if the models themselves are flawed. As Dwight D Eisenhower said: “Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable”. • Felix Martin is the author of Money: the Unauthorised Biography (Vintage) Escape from Model Land by Erica Thompson is published by John Murray (£14.99).

This approach will come as no shock given the City’s current form has its roots in Margaret Thatcher’s big bang, but what is surprising is that the Labour party too is pushing for further deregulation. In nearly 30 years campaigning on finance, I cannot recall both major political parties promoting the interests of finance so aggressively. Yes, the UK needs a successful financial sector, but deregulation and financialisation – a process whereby financial markets and institutions gain greater influence over policy and economic outcomes – is dangerous and costly for the rest of us. History has a profound lesson for an incoming Labour government. Before the 2008 financial crisis, New Labour allowed finance to become too big by adopting a permissive approach to regulation. This left the UK one of the most exposed global economies when the credit crunch came – and people are still paying the price. Today, mainstream banks are more resilient, but fault lines have shifted into the shadow banking system. Despite Brexit, the City remains one of the largest global financial centres and pursuing deregulation has consequences for the global financial system. Labour needs to recognise the risk of a regulatory race to the bottom. Beyond increasing the risk of acute crises, deregulation and financialisation also cause everyday environmental, economic and social harms. The City now promotes itself as key to preventing climate catastrophe yet still generates huge fees financing climate harm. Yet, Labour won’t commit to giving financial regulators a duty to protect the environment from finance. Financial market activities have inflated property prices, excluding younger generations from home ownership and leaving others exposed to huge mortgage debts, and pushed up private sector rents. Financialisation contributes to regional and household inequality as the huge earnings and bonuses in the finance sector outstrip the wages of ordinary workers and those with wealth gain most from rises in asset values. We have made almost no progress on financial inclusion post 2008. Millions of households have no or low savings, and so are dangerously exposed to financial shocks. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, recently found that nearly 13 million people had low financial resilience. Banks piled into speculative activities, depriving real economy firms of much needed finance. City short-termism still hinders the ability of real economy firms to plan for the future. Company boards focus on pushing up share prices to keep investors happy (and to earn bonuses) by increasing dividends, which reduces the resources available for long-term research and development and investing in people. Despite all we know, Labour wants finance to play an even bigger role in our lives. Private finance is a costly way to fund public policy goals. The state can raise taxes or borrow more cheaply – even when government borrowing costs are rising. Lenders and investors expect good returns for providing finance for projects and those returns have to be paid for in some way. Take Labour’s green plan. Labour had said it would invest £28bn a year in green initiatives with matched funding from private finance. By definition, using more costly private finance would push up the total cost of the green transition, feeding through to higher bills for households. If that isn’t pro City enough, Labour would “de-risk” investments for private finance by allowing pension funds and insurers to invest alongside the British Business Bank. We face the prospect of the state underwriting the risk of losses, allowing financial institutions to bank the rewards. A case of heads the City wins, tails we lose. So, even though deregulation and financialisation doesn’t make sense, why is it core to Labour’s economic policy? One reason may be this obsession with appearing “fiscally prudent”. In power, Labour would limit public spending, and using City finance to fund policy goals would keep costs off the state “balance sheet”. But, this is a false economy, a financial conjuring trick that would transfer higher costs to households. Let’s hope Labour recognises the need to make the City work for the environment, real economy and society. There is still time to develop a more progressive agenda for finance.

Set in Osun state in the early 00s, Ayòbámi Adébáyò’s compelling second novel explores the country’s inequalities and contradictions. A Spell of Good Things interweaves the fates of two families and describes how political failings affect their lives and lead to personal tragedy. Yèyé, the matriarch of a well-off middle-class household, recognises that good fortune is precarious: “Life was war, a series of battles with the occasional spell of good things.” She hoards her gold jewellery and dreams of marrying her eldest daughter, Wúràolá, an exhausted resident doctor, to their friends’ son, Kúnlé. From bitter experience, Yèyé knew that “real wealth was intergenerational” and “parentage would often matter more than your qualifications”. A patriarchal society obliges women to conform to familial expectations. However well educated they are, a good marriage is essential: “The husband’s house was the destination of all good girls when they became women, just as heaven was the destination of all good people when they died.” Representing a younger, more outspoken generation, Wúràolá’s feisty sister, Mótárá, counts the times she is reminded how to “behave in her marriage, in her husband’s house, towards her in-laws”. Extreme poverty exists alongside obscene opulence. Adébáyò illustrates what happens when the two worlds collide. After their father loses his job as a teacher, 16-year-old Eniolá and his family are beset by hardship. Eniolá and his bright sister Bùsólá’s education is abruptly curtailed and their mother resorts to begging to pay their school fees. Both families recognise the importance of education, but only one has the means to fulfil their children’s academic aspirations. Eniolá meets Yèyé at the local tailor’s where he runs errands, unable to afford an apprenticeship. Adébáyò vividly conveys how deprivation fuels Eniolá’s descent from determined schoolboy to politician’s thug. This immensely readable novel is a blistering indictment of the abuse of power (political and domestic) and the ubiquitous violence that can destroy lives overnight.

Thanks for joining us. It has been an extraordinary and historic day in China. Here are the main developments: China’s Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third leadership term on Sunday and introduced a new Politburo Standing Committee stacked with loyalists, cementing his place as the country’s most powerful ruler since Mao Zedong. Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang is likely to succeed Li Keqiang as premier when he retires in March. The other members of the seven-man Standing Committee, China’s top governing body, are Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, who return from the previous committee, and newcomers Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi. Li Qiang is also new to the Standing Committee. All are perceived to have close allegiance to Xi, 69, who was also re-appointed on Sunday as chairman of the Central Military Commission. The unveiling of the Standing Committee and the larger 24-member Politburo comes a day after the closing of the ruling Communist Party’s 20th Congress, where amendments were added to the party charter aimed at cementing the core status of Xi and the guiding role of his political thought within the party. The new Politburo contains no women members, where previously there was at least one, and has reduced in number to 24 from 25. The Standing Committee lineup is further confirmation that Xi’s grip on power is undiminished by the events of a tumultuous year, including a sharp economic slowdown, frustration over his zero-Covid policy, and China’s increasing estrangement from the West, exacerbated by his support for Russia’s Vladimir Putin. More from Helen Davidson – the Standing Committee was formally selected by the powerful Politburo, the ranks of which were also revealed on Sunday. Shockingly, the new Politburo contains no women members, where previously there was at least one, and has reduced in number to 24 from 25. Xi and the members of the Politburo Standing Committee: Here is some more reaction via Reuters: Ja Ian Chong, political scientist, National University of Singapore. “It certainly seems to be a consolidation of Xi’s position. This means that policies will be more directly attached to Xi for good or ill. I guess that translates to more focus on party-state control over business, less dependence on imports even as the PRC (People’s Republic of China) seeks to export. So probably more direct party-state direction of the economy. Investment will likely seek to meet those above goals, especially if they can bring in technology. So while there may be opportunities for investors, they have to look to both market forces and political preferences more. So more of what we have already been seeing. “Probably no lifting of Covid-zero policy in the near future, and more assertiveness in foreign and security. Even more broadly, US-PRC friction will continue to grow.” Dylan Loh, assistant professor, Nanyang Technology University: “It’s quite clear that the Politburo have been stacked with Xi loyalists and that would mean he has a much freer rein and mandate in pursuing his domestic and foreign policies as collective leadership and decision making has been de-emphasised over coalescing around Xi and implementing his decisions. It seems that he has not elevated a potential successor for now, which gives him the flexibility for a fourth term. Regarding investment, I do not think China’s policies will turn sharply because of this line up, I think by and large Xi’s priorities have not changed.” “Wang Huning’s presence also indicates to me that the ideological bent of the party and Xi will continue and even deepen.” Helen Davidson has some snap reaction to Xi’s speech: Quite a short speech from Xi Jinping just then, announcing the line-up of the new Standing Committee. All are seen as Xi loyalists, with the surprise addition of Cai Qi. Hu Chunhua was nowhere to be seen. 59-year-old Hu was considered to be the least Xi-aligned prospect and, having risen through the ranks as a member of the Communist Youth League faction, was perceived by some analysts as a potential threat to Xi - in as much as that is possible in the current context. Xi’s speech touched on several of the same points he made during his 104-minute address at last Sunday’s Congress opening. He warned again of “choppy waters” and “dangerous” storms in China’s future dealings with the world. But he said China’s economy would continue “opening up”, and with global development and Chinese development both needing each other. China has hit economic troubles in the last year or so, with major slowdowns in growth. But he said China had created the twin miracle of fast economic growth and long term social stability, and these fundamentals would not change - suggesting the tight grip he has over the people’s lives and freedoms would remain. He praised the successes of the CCP in boosting the prosperity of the Chinese people, and reaffirmed commitments to grow even more, into a “modern socialist nation”. He again pledged to achieve “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”, a goal which requires the annexing of Taiwan. Before leaving the stage, he invited the world’s media to visit China, saying he “welcomes unbiased and truthful stories about China”. He then takes no questions. Some analysis is coming in via Reuters: “In terms of policymaking, it does mean that there is likely to be more deference to Xi Jinping’s own views about how to move the country and the economy forward,” said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore. “An abnormally lopsided victory for one faction, which is rare in the tradition of the Communist Party, in the past there would be a rough balance of power,” said Willy Lam, Senior Fellow at US think tank the Jamestown Foundation. “It means there won*t be any checks and balances. Xi Jinping also has total control over the larger Politburo and Central Committee,” he said. Economic growth ‘downgraded’ as key party goal Chris Miller, professor at Tufts University, Massachusetts, said Congress has “reaffirmed Xi’s decisive role in ruling the Communist Party, marking a continued shift away from collective leadership of party elites toward a personalised dictatorship.” “It also appears to have confirmed the downgrading of economic growth as a key party goal, relative to other agenda items such as zero-Covid and the party’s political and ideological control. “On tech, the key theme was self-sufficiency in science and technology, which is to be expected given the increasing decoupling of the US and Chinese tech sectors,” professor Miller said. Li Qiang, the party secretary of Shanghai and a Xi ally, is likely to be appointed the next premier after Li Keqiang steps down from premiership in March after two terms. After it was revealed on Saturday that Wang Yang, previously thought to be a top contender for the post, was excluded from the list of some 200 central committee members, Li emerged to be a strong premier candidate in his current capacity as Shanghai’s party chief. Shanghai has historically been a breeding ground for top national leaders. While Li’s prospects might have been dented by the chaos of Shanghai’s protracted Covid lockdown, analysts say Xi values loyalty and trustworthiness above all and Li’s strong rapport with Xi over the years has put him in good stead. Li was Xi’s chief of staff from 2004 to 2007 when Xi was Zhejiang province’s top party boss. After Xi became China’s top leader, he promoted Li first to governor of Zhejiang and then party secretary of Jiangsu province, providing him with the regional governing experience and credentials he needed for bigger roles. Unlike most of the previous premiers, Li had no experience as a vice premier, but analysts say Li could be made a vice-premier in the next few months by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and could then be appointed premier in March. Li has proven himself to be a loyal follower of Xi - even when Shanghai’s two-month Covid lockdown caused widespread discontent and exacted heavy economic cost, Li insisted on strictly implementing the “zero Covid” policy in Shanghai according to “the spirit of the important instructions by Party Secretary Xi Jinping.” Cai Qi was the big surprise entry to the PSC. Although he had featured on some long-lists of potential candidates, the Beijing party secretary had not been widely tipped as a likely member. His entry is another sign of how Xi values both loyalists and people he knew rising up through the ranks. Like Xi, he spent many years in Fujian province at the start of his career, and moved on to Zhejiang. More recently he has been a prominent champion of the Zero Covid policy embraced by Xi, and successfully oversaw the 2022 winter Olympics. Xi ended his speech with an invitation to the world’s journalists to visit China. It’s worth noting that conditions for journalists - both foreign and local - have diminished greatly under Xi’s rule. US journalists from major outlets were expelled in 2020. Some quick reaction from China watchers: Xi Jinping has finished speaking. Reuters reports that Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang followed Xi onto the stage at the Great Hall of the People, meaning he is likely to succeed Li Keqiang as premier when he retires in March. The other members of the seven man Standing Committee, China’s top governing body, are Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, who return from the previous committee, and newcomers Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi. All are perceived to have close allegiance to Xi. The speech is ongoing. “China’s development can’t leave the world and the world’s development also needs China,” says Xi. Xi says China has created the twin miracle of fast economic growth and long term social stability. These fundamentals will not change. China will “open its door ever wider”, and will pursue “high quality development” he says, using a term which is being increasingly heard from Chinese officials no longer able to talk about China’s high speed growth which has dramatically slowed in recent months. Xi is still speaking. He has said China must remain on high alert for challenges “like a student on never-ending exams”. He says the party “can only become invincible if it is committed to self reform, even if it has had a glorious past.” He said the party is stronger and more dynamic because of its struggles and achievements in the last century. Xi’s political thought now officially drives the party’s ideology - not just because he is the current leader but also after constitutional changes this week enshrined him as being at the “core” of the party. Here is Xi Jinping (C) and other new members of the Communist Party of China’s Politburo Standing Committee: Xi is repeating his warnings of “choppy waters” and “dangerous storms” to come - it’s heightened language compared to previous meetings which were more focused on peace and development, and reflects how much more isolated China has become from the west, with numerous disputes and tensions. Xi is praising the CCP’s work in achieving its first centenary goal of “moderate prosperity for all”, and says the work now is for the second goal of achieving a modern socialist nation, and the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” - a goal which requires the annexation of Taiwan. “We have fought long and hard to open a Chinese path to modernisation,” he says. “The enormity of the task is what makes it great and infinitely glorious… Successive generations of Chinese have devoted themselves to this glorious goal. We should always remember their dedication and sacrifice.” A loyal stalwart of Xi Jinping, Li Xi is already part of the top leader’s core inner circle. Li started his career in the party’s powerful the Organisation Department and rose steadily through the ranks in a series of key positions in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanghai, Liaoning, and finally Guangdong over a period of 18 years. As the party chief of affluent Guangdong province which borders Hong Kong, he has already been in the 25-member Politburo for the past five years and is one of the most powerful non-Standing Committee politicians in the country. Li is the top official responsible for the development of the Greater Bay Area, Xi’s master plan for an integrated economic powerhouse of nine Chinese cities with Hong Kong and Macau. “I was reelected as the general secretary of the CPC central committee,” Xi says, before presenting the six other members. They are: Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, and Li Xi Xi Jinping has been confirmed as leader of China for a precedent-breaking third term, after a week-long political meeting eliminated key rivals and strengthened his political power. Xi and the six members of the new Politburo Standing Committee have just walked on stage. Xi has been confirmed as the general secretary and is going to make some remarks. Xi Jinping has walked out at the front the group. The press conference is beginning – stay tuned. The stage is set in Beijing: Xi Jinping opened the Congress meeting last week with a speech laying out his vision for the next five years in China. Helen Davidson and Emma Graham-Harrison looked at the key take-aways: Some scenes from the party congress area over the past few days: Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China’s leadership has remained unchanged. It is all male. Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping’s “new era” of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country. The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made President or Premier. Emma Graham-Harrison asks, where are the women at the top of Chinese politics? On Saturday Xi Jinping strengthened his power as leader and elevated his status within Communist party (CCP) history, with major political resolutions announced on the final day of a key political meeting. The CCP congress approved amendments to its constitution, including the “Two Establishes” and “Two Safeguards”, aimed at enshrining Xi as at the core of the party and his political thought as its underpinning ideology. A list of reappointed delegates also confirmed the premier, Li Keqiang, would be retiring from politics, along with several other senior party figures. Analysts said their exclusion was a strong sign that the next politburo standing committee (PSC), to be unveiled on Sunday, would be dominated by Xi’s allies and his power would be further consolidated. Helen Davidson has the details here: Verna Yu has spoken to some experts about Xi’s third term could mean for China. Chen Daoyin, a political commentator formerly with Shanghai University of Political Science and Law said after the 20th party congress, China is expected to continue its current conservative and hawkish stance. He said domestically, it will continue to suppress dissent and internationally, it will be confrontational and adopt the “dare to fight” spirit as mentioned by Xi many times during the congress. He expects China to clash with the United States and Europe on issues over sovereignty, security and development. “‘Struggle’ is the main theme of this congress: It will ‘struggle’ internally and externally. It will ‘dare to fight’ and be ready for tit for tat,” said Chen. Willy Lam, a senior fellow at Washington-based think tank Jamestown Foundation, predicted the personality cult surrounding Xi will exacerbate. The party and country risk becoming a “one-voice chamber” where only one voice will be heard. The supreme leader has almost totally abandoned the institutional reforms started by Deng Xiaoping and largely followed by ex-presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. There was high drama at the closing of Congress on Saturday when former leader Hu Jintao was led out of the Great Hall of the People. Hu, who is 79, and stepped down as head of the party 10 years ago, seemed confused and reluctant to leave his seat on stage. His unexpected exit prompted rampant speculation. It is unclear why he was removed, but China’s official news agency said he was feeling unwell. Emma Graham-Harrison reported on Hu’s unscheduled departure: Today we are expecting Congress delegates to elect the Standing Committee - the apex of Chinese political power at which Xi is set to sit firmly at the top. The Standing Committee is then expected to be unveiled to foreign and domestic media at a press conference around noon (0400 GMT, 3pm AEST) at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. A list of officials in the new Central Committee earlier revealed that four out of seven members of the Standing Committee will be replaced, allowing Xi to further pack the top body with loyalists. “Whichever way you look at it, it’s almost a total victory for Xi,” Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told Agence France-Presse. The move will allow Xi to get a third term as China’s president. So what exactly is the Chinese Communist party’s Congress meeting, and why is it so important? Helen Davidson has the answers. When Xi Jinping was 13 years old, at the height of China’s Cultural Revolution, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary before a frenzied crowd in Beijing. Among his accusers was his own mother, forced to join in the taunting. China’s future leader was targeted mostly because his father, a top Communist cadre, was purged by Chairman Mao Zedong. His fall dragged the family down too; Xi’s half-sister died, reportedly after intense abuse. Half a century later, the teenage boy publicly humiliated in the capital has become China’s most powerful ruler since Mao, and perhaps – given his singular control of a superpower – the most powerful man in the world. Hu Jintao ‘not feeling well’ when he left China congress, says state media Former Chinese president Hu Jintao was “not feeling well” when he was escorted out of the closing ceremony of a congress of the ruling Communist party on Saturday, according to state media. China’s official news agency Xinhua said in a tweet late on Saturday: “Xinhuanet reporter Liu Jiawen has learned that Hu Jintao insisted on attending the closing session of the party’s 20th national congress, despite the fact that he has been taking time to recuperate recently.” A second tweet said: “When he was not feeling well during the session, his staff, for his health, accompanied him to a room next to the meeting venue for a rest. Now, he is much better. Read the full story here: China’s president Xi Jinping is poised to secure a historic third term in power, cementing his position as the nation’s most influential leader since founder Mao Zedong. Xi is all but certain to be unveiled as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party again - tilting the country decisively back towards one-man rule after decades of power-sharing among its elite. His anointment will cap a week-long gathering of the party faithful in China’s capital during which high-ranking cadres endorsed his “core position” in the leadership and approved a sweeping reshuffle that saw several top officials step down.

Reuters report that the ammonia pipeline, the world’s longest, stretches about 2,470 kilometres (1,534 miles) from Russia’s Togliatti on the Volga River to three Black Sea ports. It has been shut down since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. There was no recorded leakage from the late Tuesday shelling that hit the pipeline near the village of Masiutivka and an overnight shelling near the village of Zapadne, said Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. “There is no threat to people’s lives and health,” Sinehubov said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted.Sunak said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. US military chief Milley said Ukraine is “well prepared” for a counteroffensive. The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he “does not understand” how there are any doubts that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. George Barros, an analyst at the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, has shared these images showing the extent of the flooding southeast of Kherson city: The Associated Press has this sketch from the evacuations: As shelling from Russia’s war on Ukraine echoed overhead, dozens of evacuees on an island in the Dnipro River scurried on to the tops of military trucks or into rafts to flee rising flood waters caused by the breach of a dam upstream. The unnerving bark of dogs left behind further soured the mood of those ferried to safety. A woman in one raft clutched the head of her despondent daughter. A stalled military truck stuck in swelling waters raised the panic level as Red Cross teams tried to manage an orderly evacuation. Nobody knew just how high the waters rushing through a gaping hole in the Kakhovka dam would rise, or whether people or pets would escape alive. The scrambled evacuation by boat and military truck from an island neighbourhood off the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson downstream on Tuesday testified to the latest human chaos caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities accused Russian forces of purposely destroying the dam. Russian authorities blamed recent Ukrainian military strikes. “The Russians have hit the dam, and didn’t think of consequences,” said Oleksandr Sokeryn, who fled his house with his family after it was completely flooded. “They should not be forgiven.” Officials on both sides said the massive dam breach had caused no civilian casualties, and the hurried escape was aimed to keep it that way. Rishi Sunak said that if the bursting of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on Tuesday was proven to be intentional, it would represent a “new low” in Russian aggression, BBC reporter Chris Mason tweeted. The British PM said the UK’s military and intelligence agencies were looking into the blast and it was too soon to pre-empt the cause and make a definitive judgment, while he was travelling to Washington for his upcoming meeting with Joe Biden, BBC’s Mason said. Here are some recent photos of residents from the areas affected by flooding: The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam has been widely condemned as a possible war crime. John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the national security council, said the US was assessing whether it a war crime Multiple Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that if Russia had attacked the dam it would be a war crime under the terms of the Geneva conventions. The conventions mention dams, which are listed under “works containing dangerous forces”: Article 56 – Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces 1. Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Hi, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our coverage of the war in Ukraine and the attack on Nova Kakhovka dam. I’ll be with you for the next while. If you see news you think we may have missed, have questions, or live near Nova Kakhovka dam get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Russia’s UN envoy was accused of floundering in a mud of lies when he claimed at an emergency session of the UN security council that Ukraine was guilty of a extremely dangerous strategy and a war crime by destroying Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. Sergiy Kyslytsya, the Ukraine envoy to the UN, said it was typical of Russians to blame the victim for its own crimes, noting that Russia has controlled the dam for more than a year and it would have been physically impossible to blow it up by shelling. He said the dam was mined by the Russian occupiers who blew it up and accused Russia of floundering in a mud of lies. Kyslytsya also said the flooding caused by the explosion was going to be far worse on the Ukrainian occupied side of the Dnipro river. “By resorting to scorched earth tactics, or in this case to flooded Earth tactics, the Russian occupiers have effectively recognised that the captured territory does not belong to them, and they are not able to hold these lands,” he said. Neither French US or British representatives at the UN directly claimed there was evidence of Russian responsibility, but called for an investigation and insisted their support was unwavering to Ukraine. The United States said it was “not certain” who was to blame for a burst dam in Ukraine, but it would not make sense for Ukraine to have done this to its own people and territory, while Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the disaster. The 15-member UN security council met on Tuesday at the request of both Russia and Ukraine after a torrent of water burst through a massive dam on the Dnipro River, which separates the opposing forces in southern Ukraine. When asked if the United States knew who was responsible, deputy US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, told reporters ahead of the council meeting: “We’re not certain at all, we hope to have more information in the coming days.” “But, I mean, come on … why would Ukraine do this to its own territory and people, flood its land, force tens of thousands of people to leave their homes – it doesn’t make sense,” Wood said. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said earlier on Tuesday that it did not have any independent information on how the dam burst, but described it as “another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine”. The head of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev will hold in Minsk security talks with his Belarusian counterpart this week as well as the security heads of several other countries in the region, Russia’s news agencies reported. Patrushev is to hold talks with the head of Belarus security Alexander Wolfovich on Wednesday and the heads of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), on Thursday, TASS reported. The CSTO is an intergovernmental military alliance consisting of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Asked whether the subject would be raised with the US President Joe Biden at their meeting on Thursday, Rishi Sunak added: “Of course I’ll be discussing Ukraine with President Biden, generally, but the immediate response is humanitarian. “So we had already put resources and funding in place to support both the UN and the Red Cross to respond to situations like this. “And they are now being able to divert those resources to particularly help the humanitarian response and the evacuation in this area as a result of what’s happened. “So we were already thinking ahead about situations like this, and I’m pleased that the UK is continuing to support Ukraine in lots of different ways.” Rishi Sunak said the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine would mark a “new low” in the conflict if Russian forces were found to be responsible. The UK’s prime minister said the immediate priority was the humanitarian response to the catastrophe, which has flooded villages, endangered vital crops and threatened drinking water supplies. Sunak, speaking to reporters as he travelled to Washington for talks with US President Joe Biden, said if it was an intentional act to blow up the dam it would be “the largest attack on civilian infrastructure” since the start of Vladimir Putin’s war. He said attacks on civilian infrastructure were “appalling and wrong”. Sunak said: “Our military and intelligence agencies are currently looking at it, so it’s too soon to pre-empt that and make a definitive judgment. “But what I can say is if it is intentional, it would represent, I think, the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war, and just would demonstrate the new lows that we would have seen from Russian aggression. “Attacks on civilian infrastructure are appalling and wrong. We’ve seen previous instances of that in this conflict so far, but it’s too early to say definitively.” In his nightly address, president Zelensky also said Ukrainian prosecutors had already approached prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague “to involve international justice in the investigation of the destruction of the dam”. And for the second day running, Zelenskiy singled out military units fighting in and near the long-besieged eastern city of Bakhmut while giving no details of the clashes, Reuters reports. Here are some more images sent to us on the news wires on Tuesday afternoon showing the aftermath of the explosion and collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Ukraine: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russia-occupied south of his country as “an environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Zelenskiy made the claim in his nightly video address to the nation on Tuesday, adding that only liberation of the whole of Ukraine from the Russian invasion could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts, Reuters reports. “Such deliberate destruction by the Russian occupiers and other structures of the hydroelectric power station is an environmental bomb of mass destruction,” he said. He said that he destruction of the dam would “not stop Ukraine and Ukrainians. We will still liberate all our land. Only the complete liberation of Ukrainian land from the Russian occupiers will guarantee that there will be no more such terrorist attacks.” The government of Spain has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in a statement issued Tuesday night, the Guardian’s Madrid correspondent Sam Jones reports. The statement stops short of blaming Russia for the incident, but makes clear Spain believes a crime has taken place: This act, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law, affects the lives and safety of thousands of people in the region and represents a huge environmental harm. Here’s our sketch from the Guardian’s defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh in Kherson, following the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam: On what should have been a Kherson street corner, Larysa Musian, a hydrologist, sits and watches the flood waters rising. The Dnipro River used to be 300-400 metres away, but after the dam at Nova Kakhovka was breached at 2.50am on Tuesday, it has burst into the city, flooding the first two or three blocks of the lowest lying quarter. Every half hour, Musian rises from her stool, carrying a square charcoal grey ruler. The water, she says, is rising “6 to 8cm every half hour” and is 3 metres above where it was before the dam burst. She phones through her figures to colleagues in the regional monitoring centre in nearby Mykolaiv. “When it goes back to 5cm an hour, and then four, we can start saying it has stabilised,” Musian continues, as she returns to her perch. But it is not clear when that will happen, not least because “we cannot say for sure how much water passed the dam, because it was controlled by the Russians”. For now, the river waters continue to rise visibly, in line it seems with Musian’s calculations, lapping farther up the dry streets, the latest avoidable tragedy to hit a city already blighted heavily by the 15-month war. As a scientist, what does she think of who did this? “It’s inhumane and dumb,” she says, and the culprits were “Russians who did this deliberately; I’m not thinking it was an accident.” Not everybody wanted to speak to the Guardian, but those who did knew who to blame – “Muscovites”, another resident said. The nearest Russian positions are only 2.5km away, and since Ukraine managed to liberate Kherson in November, the invaders have responded with incessant and at times deadly shelling. The low-lying area was already largely deserted and war damage is all too visible. Now it is being flooded in smelly, dirty, oil-coated river water. Read the full story: The senior US military leader, chair of the joint chiefs General Mark Milley, says that while few conclusions can be drawn from an increase of fighting in Ukraine, the country is ‘well prepared’ to carry on the battle against the Russian invasion. But he also cautions the war will be “lengthy”. Milley was speaking with the Associated Press at the American Cemetery in Normandy, France, final resting place of almost 9,400 troops who died 79 years ago during the allied D-Day invasion on 6 June, 1944. He said it was up to Ukraine to announce whether its counteroffensive campaign has formally begun, but he said Ukrainian troops are ready for the fight: There’s activity throughout Russian-occupied Ukraine and fighting has picked up. It’s our estimation that the Ukrainian military is well prepared for whatever they do. They choose to fight in the offensive fight or in the defense, they’re well-prepared. As time goes on, he says, the fighting will vary: Like the battle of Normandy or any other major battle, warfare is a give and take. There will be days you see a lot of activity and there will be days you may see very little activity. There will be offensive actions and defense actions. So this will be a back-and-forth fight for a considerable length of time. You can read Milley’s D-Day anniversary interview with the AP here. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov is warning, again, of an “escalation” in the war in Ukraine if western allies provide F-16 fighter jets for use in the conflict. “We must keep in mind that one of the modifications of the F-16 can ‘accommodate’ nuclear weapons,” he said Tuesday in a speech at a military base in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, according to Reuters. “If they do not understand this, then they are worthless as military strategists and planners.” A number of nations, including the UK, have said in recent weeks that they want to help procure the fighter jets for Ukraine. Joe Biden has not committed to supplying aircraft, but has said the US will back an international effort to train Ukrainian pilots to fly them before doing so. John Kirby, White House coordinator of strategic communications for the National Security Council, spoke to reporters about F-16s on Tuesday: The purpose of providing advanced fighter aircraft is to help Ukraine defend itself defend its airspace and its territorial integrity, period. To Lavrov, he added: If you’re worried about Ukrainian military capabilities, then you should take your troops and leave Ukraine.

Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details,” he said. Here’s what you need to know about the dam: John Kirby, coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council, has just spoken at the White House, and says the US is “assessing” the attack on the Nova Kakhovk dam. He was asked if the Biden administration considers it a war crime: I don’t have a determination on that to speak to today. I would just say we’re still trying to assess what happened here, but the Russians had illegally taken over that dam in the reservoir many months ago, and they were occupying it when this explosion happened. It’s very clear that the deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war, and in the additional protocol to the Geneva Convention that the Russians have themselves signed, destruction of civilian infrastructure, such as dams, are clearly articulated in their violations of that code. But again, we haven’t made a decision. We’re still talking to the Ukrainians. Kirby is also promising that more support for Ukraine will be coming in short order as a potential “repercussion” of the attack: I guarantee you, you’re gonna see additional security assistance packages in coming days and weeks. We’re going to continue to make sure that Ukraine can succeed on the battlefield, as President Biden has said. If Russia is concerned about Ukrainian military capabilities, best thing that they can do would be to leave Ukraine. We have made our concerns about strikes inside Russia very clear to Ukrainian officials. They’ve acknowledged that and they have assured us that they won’t use US-made equipment to strike inside Russia. We don’t want to see the war escalate and, and there’s no apologies for that. But I won’t go into detail about the private discussions that we’re having with with Ukrainians. Reuters reports that Russia’s foreign ministry said it summoned Belgium’s ambassador on Tuesday to protest what it said was the use of “Belgian weapons” by pro-Ukraine militants that attacked Russian territory last month. This claim has not been independently verified. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said “35 to 70 towns will be flooded” along the Dnipro River after the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam. He also said there could be problems accessing clean drinking water while speaking at a briefing on Tuesday. “There will be big problems with drinking water even where there is no flooding. In the whole region,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Andrei Alexeyenko, chairman of the Russian-appointed government of Ukraine’s Kherson province, said the small town of Oleshky, which lies on the southern bank of the Dnipro River, was almost completely flooded. On Telegram, Alexeyenko posted videos showing one car standing in flood water up to the window and a lorry driving along a highway in water at least a foot deep. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU commission, said on Twitter that Russia would have to “pay for the war crimes committed in Ukraine”. She called the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam an “outrageous attack on civilian infrastructure [that] puts at risk thousands of people in the Kherson region.” She also confirmed that the EU has engaged its civil protection mechanism, which would “rapidly deliver” dirt water pumps, fire hoses, mobile water purification stations and boats to those affected by the dam explosion. NBC News reports that the US government has intelligence that indicates Russia is behind the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam, according to two US officials and one western official. President Joe Biden’s administration was working to declassify some of the intelligence and share it as early as Tuesday afternoon. The western official said the collapse appears likely to make it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to conduct a river crossing. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, writes about the long-term impacts of the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse The people living along Ukraine’s lower Dnipro river must contend with the immediate consequences of the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam and flee for safety with whatever they can salvage, but the wider impact could make itself felt for generations. Downstream, the flood waters will subside somewhat as the surge reaches the Black Sea, but many of the villages and towns along the course of the Dnipro may not be habitable again unless and until a new dam is built. Thousands of homes and livelihoods have been swept away, along with countless domesticated and wild animals. The ecological trauma of such an inundation of water and silt has changed the landscape in an instant, wiping away islands and wetlands. It could take years if not decades for the fauna and flora to bounce back. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called it the “largest human-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. It is the country’s misfortune to have also been the site of the Chornobyl disaster in 1986, arguably the last calamity on such a scale. Read more: Devastation from Kakhovka dam collapse could take decades to heal Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, said he “did not understand” how there could be any doubt about whether Russian forces blew up the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement given to the Guardian, the senior aide said the dam could not have been destroyed through shelling or “any other external influence” - while another adviser to the president said the attack amounted to a war crime. In the statement, Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said: “At 2:50am this morning, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric Station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within. “We know that Russian troops had mined the hydroelectric Station in the early days of the full-scale invasion, so the pre-meditated blast is the only plausible explanation. Any alternative theories are nothing less than false Russian propaganda narratives.” Dasha Zarivna, a senior adviser in the Ukrainian presidential office, who was born and raised in Kherson, said: “The dam bombing is another unprecedented Russian war crime against Ukraine, which will have catastrophic consequences both for its population and other countries. These include environmental and economic consequences, a great risk from radiation and further serious disruption to food security. “Last October, President Zelenskiy said: ‘All the world leaders should let Russia understand that a terrorist attack on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station will be equated to the use of weapons of mass destruction’. Now it has happened. World leaders must recognise the equivalence, and now must act decisively. It is essential to isolate the terrorist state as completely as possible. Any economic ties with Russia outside of humanitarian activities should be regarded as complicity in its war crimes.” The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, calls the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam a consequence of the Russian invasion, Reuters reports. Speaking to reporters, Guterres said “one thing is clear, this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” “Attacks against civilians and critical civilian infrastructure must stop. We must act to ensure accountability and respect for international humanitarian law,” he continued. Guterres added that it was a “monumental humanitarian, economic and ecological catastrophe.” “At least 16,000 people have already lost their homes – with safe and clean drinking water supplies at risk for many thousands more,” he said. He added that the UN was coordinating with the Ukrainian government to send support including drinking water and water purification tablets. Ukraine and Russia have both asked the UN security council to meet to discuss the incident. Here are some images of nearby residents wading through flood water after the Nova Kakhovka dam explosion. Reuters reports that Finland will expel nine diplomats working at the Russian embassy in Helsinki, accusing them of working on intelligence missions. “Their actions are contrary to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,” the president’s office said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that it would inform the Russian ambassador of the expulsions. The decision was made at a meeting between Finnish president Sauli Niinisto and the country’s ministerial committee on foreign and security policy. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has blamed Russia for the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Speaking a townhall organised by broadcaster RTL, Scholz said: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Scholz also said that he intends to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, again, but added he had not done so for a long time and now was not the right time. Kira Rudik, a Ukrainian MP and leader of the liberal Holos party, said Ukraine was “one step away from a nuclear tragedy” after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. When asked about the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station during an interview with GB News, Rudik said: “President Zelenskiy has warned the world in October last year that Russians have mined the Kakhovka power plant dam and that we were one step away from from the real tragedy. Right now, it happened. “For the last year we have been saying to the world the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is critical and again we are one step away from a nuclear tragedy. “If Russians are good at anything, they’re good at committing false flag operations. So let’s do possible and impossible things to make sure that we secure the station.” She added: “As of right now, the situation is not dangerous but we cannot guarantee that that will not change and we are calling for international support, for the UN to make sure that we install international inspectors at the nuclear plant because we do not know what’s going to happen there.” There has been some reaction to the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse on the other side of the Atlantic to Europe. Reuters reports that a Biden administration official said the US was “very concerned” after the Russian-controlled dam burst, and was trying to find out more about the potential impact. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the destruction “was another example of the horrific consequences of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine”. Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said the disaster was “absolutely devastating for lives and livelihoods across the region”. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for the collapse of the dam. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Tuesday of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as part of a plan to redeploy units from the nearby Kherson region for operations against Russian forces. Reuters reports that a Russian defence ministry statement signed by Shoigu said the dam breach and resultant flooding were designed to prevent Russia from attacking near Kherson, while allowing Ukraine to “transfer units and equipment from the Kherson front to the area of offensive operations”. The widening of the Dnipro River by the flood water from the destroyed dam is likely to make it harder for Ukrainian troops to form a bridgehead and oust Russian troops from the left bank of the river and the southern portion of the Kherson oblast that Russia occupies and has claimed to annex. [See Dan Sabbagh’s analysis of potential military impact of the dam’s destruction at 10.27 BST] Here are some images we have been sent over the news wires of Russians from the Shebekinsky district in Belgorod region receiving humanitarian aid after being evacuated. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam as a distraction from ongoing border skirmishes in Russia’s Belgorod region, and suggested it will have a negative impact on Russia’s own ability to hold on to territory it occupies in Kherson region. On Telegram, Hanna Maliar posted: The Russian terrorist army has committed another crime that is capable of causing a serious ecological and humanitarian catastrophe. The purposeful undermining of the dam was carried out by the Russian occupiers in order to stop the process of de-occupation by the defence forces of Ukraine and shift the vector of public attention from the events taking place in the Belgorod region. Instead, the Russian occupiers had the opposite effect. Currently, civilians in the temporarily occupied settlements of Kherson region and Crimea are in a critical situation, as the destruction of the dam deprived them of fresh water. In addition, positions of Russian military units were flooded, which could lead to large-scale washing of Russian minefields and their detonation in a chaotic manner. Earlier, the governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, issued a denial in a video message that anti-Kremlin forces were in the settlement of Novaya Tavolzhanka, saying “there are many insinuations” but “today there is no enemy in the Belgorod region. People ask a lot about Novaya Tavolzhanka. There is no enemy on the territory of Novaya Tavolzhanka.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted to Telegram to say he met the pope’s peace envoy Cardinal Matteo Zuppi in Kyiv. Ukraine’s president wrote: We discussed the situation in Ukraine and humanitarian cooperation in the framework of the Ukrainian peace formula. Only united efforts, diplomatic isolation and pressure on Russia can influence the aggressor and bring a just peace to the Ukrainian land. I call on the Holy See to contribute to the implementation of the Ukrainian peace plan. Ukraine welcomes the readiness of other states and partners to find ways to peace, but since the war is on our territory, the algorithm for achieving peace can be Ukrainian only. Ukraine’s 10-point peace formula demands the withdrawal of Russian troops, reparations and prosecutions for Russia’s war leadership. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has claimed that a Ukrainian counteroffensive has been repulsed for three days by Russian forces who have inflicted more than 1,500 casualties in the process. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass reports: According to him, on 4 June, the armed forces of Ukraine, with the help of two brigades, tried to attack in five directions, they did not achieve success and lost 300 soldiers. On 5 June, the Kyiv regime attempted an offensive in seven directions with the forces of five brigades, was stopped and suffered significant losses, the minister said. According to him, during the attempted offensive on 5 June, Ukraine’s losses amounted to over 1,600 servicemen. The claims have not been independently verified. The president of Energoatom, Ukraine’s state energy firm, has reiterated that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam does not pose an immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the full-scale invasion. On Telegram, Petro Kotin is quoted as saying: Both in the pond itself at the ZNPP and in the so-called bowls of the basins … the normal water level is maintained, which was in them before the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric dam was blown up. He said that if the water level did fall, there were ways of topping it up. He was quoted as saying: Since September 2022, the power units of the ZNPP have not been operating, therefore active evaporation of water from the cooling pond does not occur, and there has been no need to feed it yet. And even if there will be no water in the Kakhovsky reservoir at all, the project provides measures to replenish it. One of the latter is the use of underground water from wells at the ZNPP site. Oleksandr Syenkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, has posted to say that flooding is not happening in his city, which sits on the Pivdennyi Buh River. The Pivdennyi Buh opens out into the Dnipro delta, where flood water from the Nova Kakhovka dam failure will be heading. He posted to Telegram to say: As of 2pm, the water level in the Mykolaiv area rose by 23cm. The good news: within an hour, that is, until 3pm, there were no changes. We will continue to monitor the situation. There is currently no threat of flooding. An air alert has been declared in Dnipropetrovsk region. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires of people, and their pets, being evacuated from Kherson. Oleksiy Arestovych, a former adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had no doubts that Russia was behind the dam explosion. Arestovych, a key Zelenskiy aide during the first year of the war, resigned from his official post in January after saying a Russian missile that killed dozens had in fact been shot down by Ukrainian air defence. Speaking on the sidelines of a forum of Russian opposition politicians in Brussels, he said: I’m 110% sure it was the Russians, you can tell even by the chronology of their announcements. At 6am their military bloggers and their Kherson ‘governor’ were saying ‘we’ve blown it up and we’ll flood their soldiers on the islands in the Dnipro’ and then there was a sudden change of message. There could be two reasons why they did it. One is simply to sabotage [our military’s] capability to cross the Dnipro. The second reason would be to show the world the possible consequences of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, to say ‘hold back the Ukrainians’ and show how bad the consequences could be. It fits very well with recent statements from China, from [Hungarian prime minister Viktor] Orbán, [Putin’s press secretary Dmitry] Peskov, that we are ready for a peaceful resolution. They are very scared of the counteroffensive. For now we don’t have enough facts to say which of the two reasons is the primary one. Pjotr Sauer has spoken to people living in Nova Kakhovka about the dam explosion: Two residents living in Nova Kakhovka, the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city where a dam was blown up overnight, told the Guardian that they heard loud explosions at about 2am. “I was woken up by a very loud noise,” said Tatyana, who declined to give her full name. She said she heard a noise that sounded like water flowing shortly after the initial blast. Yelena, another resident in the city, said she was woken up by what she thought was an explosion at about 2am. “We have become used to loud bangs, so I did not think it was anything serious,” she said. “It is hard to know for sure where the blast came from.” Vladimir Leontiev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, said the town had been “completely flooded” hours after the accident. Videos on social media showed swans swimming through the flooded central square of the city. Leontiev told a Russian-state news channel that the water in the town rose to over 36 feet, and some people along the riverbank were being evacuated. Some locals on the ground described a chaotic scene. “Everyone is left to fend for themselves, there is no organised evacuation,” said Gleb, who was looking for ways to leave the city. Russia’s vocal military bloggers and other war hawks have been spinning the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovska as either a Ukrainian diversion or a tactic meant to sweep away Russian defences on the left bank of the Dnipro River before their counteroffensive. Igor Girkin, a former leader of Russian proxy forces in east Ukraine, wrote on his popular Telegram blog that the dam’s failure could “wash away our forces on the left (eastern) bank of the Dnipro below [Nova Kakhovka]. That would also ‘wash away’ all of our defensive fortifications, all the minefields, all the warehouses with ammunition would be flooded, it would fully or partially destroy all the property that they didn’t manage to pack up and ship away (and that would be quite a bit, unfortunately).” Although they often come into conflict with the military, most seem to have endorsed the Kremlin line of “deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side”, as claimed by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. But others have deviated from the party line. In a video, Yegor Guzenko, a popular commentator who has fought in the war, smiled broadly as he said he had predicted many times before that the dam would eventually become a target. “I won’t say who blew it up,” he said. “But from a tactical point of view, the [Ukrainians] can forget about the offensive in the Kherson direction. “If the evacuation [of Russian military personnel] goes well and without losses then we can blow up all the fucking dams on the Dnipro River if it fucking suits us.” Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, and Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, describe the devastation unleashed by the collapse of Nova Kakhovka dam. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the water from the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while countless pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic impact on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream. Read more here: Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s interior minister, claims that Russia is shelling areas in southern Kherson where people are being evacuated, leaving two police officers wounded. “The Russian military continue to shell territory where evacuation measures are being carried out. An hour ago, two police officers were wounded in the area. Shelling continues at the moment,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. European leaders must not be naive to the divisions Russian propaganda can cause in communities hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees, a special adviser to the EU has said. Unveiling a report on how Ukrainians fleeing the war have fared in the EU, Lodewijk Asscher said that “solidarity is alive and kicking” but added that societies need to be on guard against “solidarity fatigue”, particularly towards more vulnerable refugees. Around 4 million refugees remain in the EU, down from a peak of 16 million, with 11 million returning to Ukraine and 1 million moving to other countries, mainly Canada and the US, says the report, titled Integration of People Fleeing Ukraine in the EU. Of the 3.8 million seeking protection under special EU laws, more than half were hosted by Germany and Poland, which accounted for 2 million refugees. The highest number per capita of domestic population are being hosted by Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Russia says it has launched a criminal investigation into the blowing up of Nova Kakhovka dam, Reuters reports. Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Tuesday that it had launched a criminal investigation into the overnight destruction of the hydroelectric dam which sits in the Russian-controlled part of Ukraine’s Kherson region. Ukraine’s foreign ministry has called for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure” on the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a statement, the ministry also called for the UN atomic agency’s board of governors to discuss the incident and demanded new sanctions on Russia from the G7 and the EU, with a particular focus on the Russian missile industry and nuclear sector. The ministry also called on the EU to engage its the civil protection mechanism which can deliver aid to those in need following a natural or human-made disaster. The EU has condemned the destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam, calling it a “horrific and barbaric” escalation of Russian aggression against Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference in Brussels, Peter Stano, the European Commission’s spokesperson, said: ”“This is a new sign of escalation, bringing the horrific and barbaric nature of Russian aggression against Ukraine to unprecedented levels.” Vladimir Leontyev, the Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, called the breach of the dam in the city a “terrorist act” and blamed Ukraine, Reuters reports. Speaking to Russian state television, Leontyev said: “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it.” The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of sabotaging the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, which sits in a Russian-occupied part of Ukraine, to distract attention from a supposedly “faltering” counteroffensive against Russian forces, Reuters reports. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. He said the destruction of the dam was intended to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir through the North Crimean Canal, and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. “Apparently, this sabotage is also connected with the fact that having started large-scale offensive actions two days ago, now the Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals – these offensive actions are faltering.” Asked about Ukrainian allegations that Russia had destroyed the dam, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” Peskov said the sabotage could “potentially have very serious consequences for several tens of thousands of residents of the region”. Kaja Kallas, the prime minister of Estonia, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam a war crime. She said on Twitter that the “terrorist state Russia has now turned water into a weapon”. “Destroying [Nova Kakhovka] dam is a war crime affecting countless civilians and bringing ecocide and mass destruction,” she said. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, has called the blowing up of the Nova Kakhovka dam “a fundamentally new stage of Russian aggression”. He said on Twitter that Russia had openly declared “its true goal – the destruction of Ukraine, killing Ukrainians, destroying the economy and life support structures.” The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Ukrahydroenergo said the hydoelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken by bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and to other Ukrainian cities including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. Occupying Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Vladimir Leontyev told the Tass news agency it was a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them”. Leontyev said part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons, and about 300 houses had been evacuated. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, told the broadcaster Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” Here is an updated report from our video team on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The chief of the UN’s atomic agency, Rafael Grossi, has issued a statement about the Nova Kakhovka dam destruction and its potential impact on nuclear safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). He said a planned visit to the plant would go ahead next week, and called on both sides in the conflict to do nothing to further endanger safety at the plant, drawing particular attention to the on-site cooling pond. The IAEA’s director general said: The IAEA staff on the site have been informed that the damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam is currently leading to about 5cm/hour reduction in the height of the reservoir. The main line of cooling water is fed from the reservoir and pumped up through channels near the thermal power plant to the site. It is estimated that the water through this route should last for a few days. Water in the reservoir was at around 16.4 metres at 8am. If it drops below 12.7 metres then it can no longer be pumped. The ZNPP is making all efforts to pump as much water into its cooling channels and related systems as possible. In addition, non-essential consumers of water are being stopped at ZNPP to reduce the consumption of water. ZNPP management is discussing further measures to be implemented. There are a number of alternative sources of water. A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir. As the reactors have been shut down for many months, it is estimated that this pond will be sufficient to provide water for cooling for some months. The agency will confirm this very shortly. It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that. My trip to ZNPP next week was planned and now it is essential. I will go. The destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine will not prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing, Reuters reports a senior Ukrainian commander said on Tuesday. “As for preventing our offensive actions, the military command has taken into full account such treacherous enemy actions, and it should not prevent our advance in those directions where there may be spillage of water,” Serhiy Naev, commander of the joint forces of the armed forces of Ukraine, was quoted as saying by the state news agency Ukrinform. While attention has understandably focused on the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, clear-up operations have also been carried out in Kharkiv after a Russian strike. Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, offers this analysis of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam: Although it remains not yet confirmed exactly how the dam was blown, it is the Russian military who, cynically, would probably think they have the most to gain. Ukraine will have to deal with a destroyed dam plus the long-term environmental and humanitarian consequences. Experts fear it will wipe out islands in the delta and low-lying settlements, mostly on the southern bank. There are about 16,000 people estimated to be in the critical zone on the Ukrainian side of the river. Such predictable impacts mean it is likely to be a war crime, as defined in the Geneva conventions, if its breach causes “release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses” to civilians. If it is the case, as initially reported, that water levels have been built up to a 30-year high in recent weeks, that could suggest a degree of forethought that would only bolster a future legal case. The obvious military point is that Russia feared an amphibious attack across the Dnipro delta. Some of Ukraine’s armed forces have been receiving marine training from the UK, suggesting that, at the very least, Kyiv wanted to keep the option open of trying what would have been a relative risky attack that, if successful, could have opened up the option of a more direct strike towards Crimea – or diverting Russian forces away from the southern front further east in Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. Russian defensive positions downstream, as mapped from satellite imagery, have already been concentrated on higher ground. The breach of the dam is an uncertain event, and it will take some days before it is clear where the new river line will be – and whether the fortifications are in appropriate positions. Widening the Dnipro River from hundreds of metres to several kilometres makes the task of crossing in strength all the harder at the delta. Russia still has its air force available to make a river crossing difficult, and as the battle for Kherson in November showed, it is difficult to keep a bridgehead across the country’s central river supplied. However, it is also the case that the river is likely to narrow upstream, south of Zaporizhzhia. That may also create some military opportunities for Kyiv. What is certain is that as with the impact on civilians and the environment, all the consequences are some way from being played out. Russia blew up the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine to prevent Ukrainian forces from crossing the Dnipro River, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command said on Tuesday. “This is a hysterical reaction,” Natalia Humeniuk told an online briefing, Reuters reports. “They were aware that the movement of the defence forces would take place, and in this way tried to influence the defence forces so that the crossing of the [river], which they feared, would not happen.” There are limited crossing points over the river. Ukraine holds the right bank, to the north, while Russia continues to occupy the left bank and the south of Kherson oblast. A state of emergency has been declared by local Moscow-backed authorities in the Nova Kakhovka district of the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Kherson region after the dam breach, Reuters reports, citing Tass. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has criticised the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, tweeting: The destruction of the Kakhovka dam puts thousands of civilians in danger, leaving many with no homes and in dire humanitarian need. Civilians and civilian infrastructure are not a target. Its social media team are maybe not entirely in lockstep with that of its parent organisation UN, which has run into vocal social media criticism for earlier using Twitter to promote today as “Russian Language Day”. The Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko was among those to reply to the tweet, asking: “Do you want to write anything about the explosion of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station? Or will you celebrate the Russian language day?” The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is in Ukraine, where he has been visiting the Halo Trust in the Kyiv region, an NGO that works in demining. Our community team are asking for your witness reports of the aftermath of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam if you live in the region. Details of how to contact them can be found here: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted details from the emergency national council meeting (NSDC) this morning to respond to the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Ukraine’s president posted to Telegram to say: I held an urgent meeting of the national security council. Overnight [at] 02.50am, Russian terrorists carried out an internal detonation of the structures of the Kakhovskaya HPP [hydroelectric power plant]. About 80 settlements are in the flooding zone. It was ordered to carry out evacuation from risk areas and to provide drinking water to all cities and villages that were supplied with water from the Kakhovsky reservoir. We do everything to save people. All services, military, government, are involved. At the NSDC meeting, a set of international and security measures was agreed upon to hold Russia accountable for this terrorist attack. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, has condemned the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam and offered Moldova’s support. She tweeted: I strongly condemn the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam this morning. Russia’s targeting of critical infrastructure amounts to war crimes. President Zelenskiy, we stand ready to provide assistance in response to the floods and support efforts to mitigate the impact. The Russian military is shelling Kherson with artillery, while the population is being evacuated in the city, the ministry of internal affairs reported. Two police officers received shrapnel wounds, Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is another image that has come through of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Video is circulating on social media that appears to show the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant has been completely submerged by rising waters of the Dnipro River. The Guardian has not independently verified the video. The Telegram channel of Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying some quotes from the Russian-imposed acting governor of occupied Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo. It reports: Large-scale evacuation of people will not be required in the Kherson region after the destruction of the structures of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, said Saldo. The destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station led to the flow of a large, but not critical amount of water along the [Dnipro] River, this will not prevent the Russian forces from protecting the left bank, Saldo noted. It also quotes the Russian-imposed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, claiming: The situation at the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station is a consequence of Ukrainian armed forces strikes on the station, which have continued daily since the summer of 2022, the authorities said. The Kakhovka HPP continues to collapse, water is discharged uncontrollably, the head of Nova Kakhovka said. Shebekino district in Russia’s Belgorod region is being shelled, local authorities told residents on Tuesday. Reuters reports that in messages via social media, residents were warned to take cover in cellars. The destruction of a dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine is an attempt by Moscow to “raise the stakes” in its full-scale invasion and stoke fears of a nuclear catastrophe, a senior Ukrainian official said on Tuesday. “Today, the world must understand that this is an attempt by terrorists to raise the stakes and scare everyone with a possible nuclear disaster,” Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administration, wrote on Telegram, Reuters reports. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 120 miles downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement saying the situation at the plant was under control, and the International Atomic Energy Agency said its experts at the site were monitoring the situation and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk”. But there are long-term concerns over safety and the possibility of the plant operating again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C, so that it will be easier to restart when conditions allowed, and to supply hot water to the neighbouring town of Enerhodar. Oleksiy, who left after the Russians occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should now be shut down, and that the plant had sufficient resources for now to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was current at 16.6 metres, “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP where water can be maintained above the reservoir level and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if the ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is senior research associate at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir that had been created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. Budjeryn had another sobering thought about the implications. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.” Tass reports that the Russian-imposed head of the settlement of Nova Kakhovka says the water has risen by 10 metres. Here is some of the earlier video footage of the damage at the Nova Kakhovka dam. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, carries this latest report on the consequences of the damaged to the Nova Kakhovka dam: Due to the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP, there is a threat of flooding up to 80 settlements, prime minister [Denys] Shmyhal said. As of now, more than 10 settlements have been completely or partially flooded, reported the Kherson regional authority. About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region. Local authorities are evacuating residents from potential flood zones. At 12pm an evacuation train will leave Kherson for Mykolaiv. Suspilne also provided this graphic showing the likely affected settlements. Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, has issued a strong statement after the destruction of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant, which Ukrhydroenergo claims was destroyed by an explosion from inside the turbine hall. Kostin tweeted: Russia can only destroy and kill. And will stop at nothing. Blowing up the Kakhovskaya HPP is another proof of this and an international crime. Today, the cornered occupiers are killing and leaving thousands of people homeless, whom they wanted to “integrate into the Russian Federation” just yesterday. Cannibalistic “scorched earth” tactics worthy of Hitler. Anyone who still thinks that it is possible to talk about something with an aggressor should remember the streams of dirty water that wash away the homes of people who were sleeping peacefully. The end of the criminal Russian regime can only be one – defeat and a tribunal. The Russian-imposed mayor of the occupied settlement of Nova Kakhovk near the damaged dam has blamed Ukraine for the incident. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carrying quotes from Vladimir Leontyev for Russia’s domestic audience, in which it claims: Leontyev said that there was no explosion at the station, but night strikes led to the destruction and water began to uncontrollably be discharged downstream. According to him, the armed forces of Ukraine continue to shell the city. The blow to the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, presumably, was delivered from an MLRS [multiple launch rocket system]. Leontyev said that it is still impossible to predict whether the Kakhovskaya HPP will continue to collapse. According to him, the hydroelectric power plant has suffered serious damage and it is presumably impossible to repair it. As the mayor added, the destruction at the station will lead to problems in the delivery of water to the Crimea. At the same time, the destruction does not pose any critical danger for the Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant]. Leontyev called the incident a serious terrorist act and a catastrophe, which “was created by the Ukrainian authorities and those who govern them.” He said that the consequences will still be studied, the main task now is to help citizens. Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka dam in a Russian-occupied part of southern Ukraine “in a panic”, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Tuesday. “The occupiers blew up the dam of the Kakhovka reservoir in a panic – this is an obvious act of terrorism and a war crime, which will be evidence in an international tribunal,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on Telegram. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction of the dam in southern Ukraine on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details. But it’s worth remembering that the only reason this is an issue at all is because of Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he told Reuters. “We’ll continue to assess the developing situation, but the best thing Russia could do now is withdraw their troops immediately.” Denys Sukhanov, a humanitarian volunteer who works in the Ukrainian-controlled Kherson territory, has told Suspilne that “Kherson urgently needs people who will perform the duties of volunteers to coordinate actions at evacuation points, receiving people, boarding buses, resettlement and feeding.” A Russian-installed official in the town of Nova Kakhovka said on Tuesday residents of about 300 houses had been evacuated after the nearby dam was breached, state-owned news agency Tass reported. Reuters reports that Tass also quoted Nova Kakhovka’s Russian-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, as saying that part of the town had been disconnected from power supplies for safety reasons. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power plant was completely destroyed “as a result of the explosion of the engine room from the inside” and is not repairable. It cites Ukrahydroenergo. More details soon … Julian Borger and Dan Sabbagh report from Kyiv for the Guardian: The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of blowing up the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River, and called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. As aerial footage circulated on social media, showing most of the dam wall washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream, the army’s Southern Operational Command put up a Facebook post accusing “Russian occupation troops” of blowing up the hydroelectric dam. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated for districts upstream of Kherson city and would be taken to bus to the city and then by train to Mykolaiv, and on to other Ukrainian cities. The disaster happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. Local Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied that anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday in the wake of the disaster. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the river downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not take the brunt of the flood, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people would lose their homes. There could be two further dramatic side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could be severely affected. Read more here: Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former minister and president of the Kyiv School of Economics, notes that the peak water from the breach of the dam would be expected at 11am local time (9am BST). He suggests that the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River is more at risk. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory, but that “everything is under control”. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the Ukrainian military claims to have shot down a Russian Ka-52 helicopter in the direction of Shakhtarsk on Monday, citing the general staff. The claims have not been independently verified. Here is my colleague Jonathan Yerushalmy on why the dam is so significant and poses such a threat: The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The reservoir it contains holds an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Soon after Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, the head of the Kherson region urged residents to evacuate the area, warning that “water will reach a critical level in five hours”. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also probably wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. Read more here: Nova Kakhovka Dam – everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and an adviser to the interior ministry, has suggested on social media that about 16,000 people may be affected by any potential flood from the breach of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The video footage in his tweet has not been independently verified by the Guardian. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has said that “only force” can solve the “global threat” posed by Russia, in a message on the Telegram app. He posted: The destruction of the Kakhovskaya HPP is the largest man-made disaster in the world in recent decades, which kills the environment and will negatively affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the years to come. The insane goal of stopping the defence forces’ advance and avoiding defeat and disgrace drives Kremlin criminals. They are willing to do anything to raise the stakes in this war. Today’s Russia is a global threat. Only force can solve this problem. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. I’m handing over to my colleague Martin Belam who will bring you the latest from the aftermath of this very distressing development in the war. Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister has called the destruction of the dam “probably Europe’s largest technological disaster in decades” and a “heinous war crime”: The Financial Times’ Moscow bureau chief has shared modelling done previously on how the dam’s destruction is likely to affect Kherson: Prof Hubert Chanson, from the University of QLD School of Civil Engineering, expects that a flood of water from the destroyed Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine will put people at risk of drowning and slow military action further downstream. “Anyone living in low-lying areas downstream of the dam could be drowned,” he says. “Significant flooding is likely to happen, depending on the volume of the dam at the time. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the destruction of the dam is to slow down military action further downstream. A large body of water behind a low-lying dam could cause a long-lasting flood that is not going to end in a couple of days.” Restoration of the dam is “not going to be a quick fix”, Chanson says. Repair will include blocking the bridge and the opening in the dam, typically by dumping rocks or concrete blocks. “To do so would be a matter of civil engineering,” he says. “You can only do so if in a secure environment, if one party is in charge of the dam and has access to the dam site.” Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company, has responded to the damage to the dam, saying it “may have negative consequences for the [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant], but the situation is under control”. It has blamed the dam’s flooding on Russian forces, saying, “On the night of June 6, 2023, the Russian invaders blew up the dam of the Kakhovskaya HPP.” It explained that the “rapidly decreasing” water levels in the reservoir posed an “additional threat to the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP.” For now, however, the nuclear power station’s cooling pond was full, it said. Water from the Kakhovsky reservoir is necessary for the station to receive power for turbine capacitors and safety systems of the ZNPP. The station’s cooling pond is now full: as of 8am, the water level is 16.6 metres, which is sufficient for the station’s needs. Energoatom monitors the situation and follows the actions of workers at the ZNPP together with other international organisations present at the plant, in particular, the IAEA. Any changes will be promptly notified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has suggested that what he called the “destruction” of the Nova Kakhovka dam was the fault of “Russian terrorists”. Zelenskiy said in a post on Twitter, “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror.” He added: “All services are working. I have convened the national security and defence council.” In May, residents in a nearby village reported ongoing flooding which they blamed on Russia’s occupation of Nova Kakhovka. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, locals said the water level had begun to rise in April, sometimes by up to 30cm a day, and had remained elevated since. Ukrainian officials said the “rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam”. But they added that they were unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because they did not have access themselves. A Russian energy official also warned in May that the dam risked being overwhelmed by record-high water levels. This unverified footage reportedly shows the view from the top of the dam’s generator hall: If you’re just joining us, a vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. You can get in touch with me on Twitter here. Here is what we know so far: Unverified videos on social media showed water surging through the remains of the dam, with bystanders expressing their shock. Ukraine’s national police urged people in affected villages to evacuate. The police force named the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson – Korabel Island. “Units of the national police and the state emergency service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River” the police force said on Telegram. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will hold an emergency meeting, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, said on Twitter on Tuesday. The Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. The dam, 30 metres tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka [dam] was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the south command of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling, while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. Russia’s destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine represents an “ecocide”, but national and regional officials are working to ensure the safety of local residents, the head of Ukraine’s presidential administration said on Tuesday. Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram that Russia’s actions also present a threat to the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, without elaborating Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Nova Kakhovka dam has been earmarked as a potential target for both its strategic importance - as well as the damage that its destruction would unleash. It was captured by Russia at the start of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, and has been held by it ever since. In October, as Ukraine was in the midst of reclaiming large parts of occupied Kherson, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to warn Russia not to blow up the dam, warning that it would flood a large area of southern Ukraine. At the time, he claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives inside the dam. Zelenskiy said “destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster,” and compared such an act to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine military intelligence said “the scale of the ecological disaster [would] go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”. At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it. After Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November, images emerged of some significant damage to the dam. Russia had accused Ukraine of shelling the dam in its campaign to recapture Kherson. Here is more video of the dam flooding, via the Kyiv post: Ukraine’s National Security Council has announced that Zelenskiy will hold an emergency meeting over the dam blast. On 25 May Reuters reported that Ukrhydroenergo, which owns the dam, had blamed high water levels in the Dnieper river on Russia. “The rise of the Dnieper’s water level, as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam,” state company said in a statement. It said the 17-metre (56-foot) level in the pool held back by the dam was a metre higher than normal for this time of year, Reuters reported. But the company said it was unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because it did not have access itself. The dam was at “unprecedentedly” high levels before today, the Washington Post’s Evan Hill reports: Washington Post investigative journalist Evan Hill has shared satellite images showing what appears to be evidence that a section of the dam was damaged or destroyed on 5 June: Here is a larger image showing the dam on 28 May this year: And yesterday at 12:15pm local time: Russian news agency Tass reports, citing emergency services, that 80 settlements may be affected by flooding. The damage to the dam will also lead to problems with water supplies to Crimea, Tass cites the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying. Here is the unverified footage of the dam flooding being shared widely on social media, including by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine: Ukraine’s National Police force are asking people in affected villages to evacuate. The Police said on Telegram a moment ago: Units of the National Police and the State Emergency Service of the Kherson region were alerted to alert and evacuate the civilian population from potential flooding zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River, namely: the villages of Mykolaivka, Olhivka, Lyovo, Tyaginka, Poniativka, Ivanovka, Tokarivka, Poniativka, Prydniprovske, Sadove and partly the city of Kherson - Korabel Island. The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: 🔹turn off all electrical appliances 🔹take documents and essentials 🔹take care of loved ones and pets 🔹 follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen. Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, has posted more details about evacuations to Telegram. Residents in what he called the “danger zone” were also urged to turn off electrical appliances. Gerashchenkosaid: ❗️ In the Kherson region, the settlements on the right bank of the Dnieper have been named as being at risk of flooding Evacuation of the civilian population from potential flood zones on the right bank of the Dnieper River is underway, namely: ▪️ The village of Nikolaevka, ▪️ Olgovka, ▪️ Лёво, ▪️ Tyaginka, ▪️ Ivanivka, ▪️ Ivanovka, ▪️Tokarevka, ▪️ Pridneprovskoye, ▪️Partly the city of Kherson - the island of Korabel. The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: 🔹turn off all electrical appliances, 🔹take documents and essential items, 🔹will take care of loved ones and pets, 🔹 follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen. Here is a summary of what we know so far, via Reuters: A vast Soviet-era dam in the Russian controlled part of southern Ukraine was blown on Tuesday, unleashing a flood of water across the war zone, according to both Ukrainian and Russian forces. Both sides blamed the other for destroying the dam. The dam, 30 metres (yards) tall and 3.2 km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnieper river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It holds a reservoir of about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah and also supplies water to the Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s military said that Russian forces blew up the dam. “The Kakhovka (dam) was blown up by the Russian occupying forces,” the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday on its Facebook page. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified.” Russian news agencies said the dam, controlled by Russian forces, had been destroyed in shelling while a Russian-installed official said it was a terrorist attack – Russian shorthand for an attack by Ukraine. The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnieper River, holding back an enormous reservoir of water. The dam itself is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The enormous reservoir that it contains holds about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south - which was annexed by Russia in 2014 - as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydro-electric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It would also wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. The UK ambassador to Ukraine, Dame Melinda Simmons, has retweeted a post calling what has happened at the dam “An appalling act of ecocide by the Russian regime”. The large Nova Kakhovka Dam in the Russia-controlled parts of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was destroyed and the territory is flooding, Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source close to the matter. A second state news agency RIA cited the Moscow-installed Mayor of Nova Kakhovka as saying that the upper part of the dam was destroyed by shelling. The mayor earlier denied that that the dam had been blown up. Tass then quoted him as saying that the destruction of the dam was a “serious terrorist act”. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian were able to independently verify the reports. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson region, has posted a video to Telegram in which he says that as a result of the damage to the Nova Kahhovka dam, “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours” and that evacuations have begun. The translation of the video was obtained via Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Gerashchenko posted the video from Prokudin’s Telegram, with the text: The water will reach a critical level in 5 hours, the evacuation has begun - the head of Kherson OVA As Alexander Prokudin reported, local residents have already begun to be evacuated from potential flood areas. He confirmed that the [Russians] had blown up the Kakhovskaya HPP and called for them to leave the dangerous places as soon as possible. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the Kakhovka Dam on the Dnieper River was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. The Nova Kakhovka dam in the Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine’s Kherson region was blown up by Russian forces, the South command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on Tuesday. “The scale of the destruction, the speed and volumes of water, and the likely areas of inundation are being clarified,” the command said on its Facebook page. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. In breaking news: Ukraine’s Southern Military command has accused Russia of “blowing up” the Nova Kakhovka dam near Kherson, “likely” causing flooding. The Guardian has not been able to verify the claim. Unverified video footage shared on social media on Tuesday morning appeared to show a large amount of water flowing out of the dam. The mayor of Nova Kahhovka, a city in Russia-controlled parts of the Ukrainian region of Kherson, denied social media reports that the dam was blown up, Russia’s state RIA news agency reported early on Tuesday. Russian and Ukrainian social media reported widely in early hours on Tuesday that the dam was destroyed. Neither Reuters nor the Guardian have been able to independently verify the reports. We’ll have more information shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has confirmed that in some areas Kyiv’s forces are moving to “offensive actions”, heightening speculation that a counteroffensive is close to launch. Russia claimed to have repelled a “major offensive” in the Donetsk region and to have killed hundreds of Ukrainian troops, but the claims could not be independently verified. The defence ministry in Moscow said Ukraine had attacked with six mechanised and two tank battalions from two brigades. The ministry claimed 250 Ukrainian troops had been killed, and 16 tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles and 21 armoured personnel carriers destroyed. It also claimed that Valery Gerasimov, the Russian chief of general staff, had been near the frontlines when the attack was repelled. The Russian defence ministry has consistently made exaggerated claims about the casualties its forces have inflicted. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed on Monday what he called “the news we have been waiting for” from troops in Bakhmut, but gave no further details. “I am grateful to each soldier, to all our defenders, men and women, who have given us today the news we have been waiting for. Fine job, soldiers in the Bakhmut sector!” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. The US imposed sanctions on members of a Russian intelligence-linked group for their role in Moscow’s efforts to destabilise democracy and influence elections in Moldova, the Treasury department said. The sanctions target seven individuals, several of whom maintain ties to Russian intelligence services, the department said. They include the group’s leader, Konstantin Prokopyevich Sapozhnikov, who organised the plot to destabilise the government of Moldova, which borders Ukraine, earlier this year. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, met with Zelenskiy in Kyiv. They discussed preparations for the Nato summit in Lithuania next month and Ukraine’s plan for ending Russia’s invasion. During the meeting, Cleverly said: “Ukraine will win this war and can count on our support.” Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, said three people were killed in the region yesterday as a result of Russian attacks. Two drones have fallen on the M3 Ukraine highway, in the Russian region of Kaluga, just south of Moscow, the region’s governor has said. There was no detonation and the sites have been cordoned off by investigators, said governor Vladislav Shapsha. Poland’s agriculture minister has received a draft regulation from the European Commission extending a ban on Ukrainian grain imports until 15 September, he said on Monday. Belgium will ask Ukraine for clarification on reports that rifles made in Belgium had been used by pro-Ukrainian forces to fight Russian troops inside Russia’s western border, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo said on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T16:34:30Z","webTitle":"Libyan general says 2.5 tonnes of missing uranium found near storage base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/16/un-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-uranium-missing-libya","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 2 tonnes of natural uranium reported missing by the UN’s nuclear watchdog in war-torn Libya have been found, a general in the country’s east has said. Gen Khaled al-Mahjoub, the commander of eastern warlord Khalifa Haftar’s communications division, said the containers of uranium had been recovered barely 5km (3 miles) from where they had been stored in southern Libya, and after the International Atomic Energy Agency reported their disappearance earlier on Thursday. The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told the organisation’s member states that inspectors on Tuesday found that 10 drums containing approximately 2.5 tonnes of uranium ore concentrate “were not present as previously declared”. Natural uranium cannot immediately be used for energy production or bomb fuel, as the enrichment process typically requires the metal to be converted into a gas, then later spun in centrifuges to reach the levels needed. However, each tonne of natural uranium, if obtained by a group with the technological means and resources, can be refined to 5.6kg (12lbs) of weapons-grade material over time, experts say. That made finding the missing metal important for nonproliferation experts. The discovery that the uranium had gone missing was the result of an inspection originally planned for last year that “had to be postponed because of the security situation in the region” and was finally carried out on Tuesday, according to a confidential statement from Grossi. He said not knowing the location of the material could present a radiological risk and concerns over nuclear security. In 2003, Libya, under its then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, renounced its nuclear weapons programme, which had obtained centrifuges that could enrich uranium as well as design information for a nuclear bomb, although it made little progress towards a bomb. The African country has been mired in a political crisis since Gaddafi’s fall in 2011, with myriad militias forming opposing alliances backed by foreign powers. Libya remains split between a nominally interim government in the capital, Tripoli, in the west and another in the east backed by the military strongman Khalifa Haftar.

A new exhibition at Manchester’s Science and Industry Museum is asking visitors to match certain types of music with tastes. Does this sound sweet, sour, bitter, salty? Ridiculous, you might think, and as I listen to each of the sounds – screechy, plinkety-plonky, lush, mournful – initially I am reluctant to make my selections, fearing ridicule in front of curator Steven Leech. But then something magical happens: the screechy music does indeed suddenly bring to mind bitter lemons and the lush sounds do conjure up strawberries. Leech’s music-meets-food exhibit is a fun way of interpreting a serious piece of research by Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at Oxford University. It is the model for much of this new exhibition, Turn It Up, which takes the research being done into the effects of music at universities across the world and tries to make it accessible to a general audience. “The exhibition is about the way music affects our bodies and minds, and drives us to innovate, create and share,” says Leech. “We did some audience testing and found that the majority of the people, unless they played an instrument or could read music, felt ‘unmusical’ – ignoring the ubiquity of music in their lives and its centrality in our culture.” He aims to show that in fact almost everyone is musical and has an emotional response to what they hear. The exhibition is in two halves. The first looks at the innate human urge to create music and where our ingenuity and technological innovation have led. This section draws on objects, displaying a weird and wonderful collection of musical instruments, listening devices from ancient gramophones to the iPhone, and new tech that allows disabled musicians to make music. It also charts ongoing experiments with artificial intelligence. “The homeward-bound half is more reflective, thinking about the effect music has on us as individuals,” says co-curator Emily Scott-Dearing. We are programmed to respond to musical tropes – though whether as a result of cultural conditioning or something innate is far from clear. One exhibit demonstrates that a lullaby has certain musical qualities which are universally felt. Conversely, our brains are programmed to react adversely to dissonance. But Scott-Dearing insists cultural conditioning plays a part too. “In western music there are associations between major keys and happiness, and minor keys and sadness,” she explains, “but that is not universal across all music systems.” Music’s ability to relax us is well attested – Classic FM has built its entire marketing pitch around it – and Turn It Up looks at ways it is used for medical purposes, not least to treat dementia sufferers. “Manchester Camerata has a project called Music in Mind, which runs group music therapy sessions in care homes,” says Scott-Dearing, “and there was a study that found a significant reduction in medication use.” Music was taking the place of drugs in reducing agitation and distress among patients. Work is under way to produce an app which would allow this musical immersion treatment to be given remotely. Leech says the aim is to produce individualised “prescription playlists” that use sensors to track a patient’s mood through the day, and play pain-relieving songs when needed. Music has other measurable effects on us. One study has shown that supermarkets playing generic French or German music in their wine aisles – think accordions and oompah bands – affects the amount of wine they sell from those countries. Consumers don’t have to know what they are listening to; they subliminally absorb the musical message and buy accordingly. Other research suggests playing classical music in commercial environments makes consumers spend more money. “We have value associations that we put on music,” says Scott-Dearing, “and classical music is seen as high end.” Professor Adrian North has demonstrated that playing classical music rather than muzak or pop in a cafe can boost sales by 20%. Another study has shown that classical music encourages shoppers to buy luxury items, whereas country music prompts more utilitarian purchases. Fast music, meanwhile, makes you shop more quickly. That also explains why tunes by marching bands are sometimes played at London’s Waterloo station – to stop commuters lingering on the concourse. Underground stations also play soothing music to boost commuter well-being and encourage calm behaviour in situations that can become stressful. Can listening to music combat insomnia? My faith in whether sleep playlists work was somewhat undermined by learning at Turn It Up that one of the most common songs used by insomniacs is the dance track Dynamite by South Korean boy band BTS. But music to fall asleep to doesn’t have be soporific, Leech explains; familiarity can be more important. “If [music] makes you feel more comfortable and takes you to a different place, it can get you more prepared for sleep,” he says. The exhibition draws on the work of sleep researcher Kira Vibe Jespersen, though her findings offer no magic bullet for insomniacs. She has shown that playing music does not objectively improve your sleeping patterns, but can make you believe you have slept better, compared with, say, using audiobooks. Memory is another key theme of the show. Sometimes music triggers personal memories that become more important than the sound itself. Desert Island Discs demonstrates that week in, week out, playing the pieces that have become signposts in a person’s life. And that we set such store by the music played at the funerals of loved ones is no accident: it can encapsulate an attitude to life. Turn It Up tries to answer many questions. Some are broad and quasi-philosophical. How does the brain process music? Why does it trigger memory? Why does it make us dance? Others are more practical. What music, for instance, is best for a call centre to use while callers are on hold? Pleasant tunes without lyrics that appear to have no beginning and no end – callers don’t like to be reminded of the passage of time while they are hanging on. One experiment showed that they were more likely to stay on the line if the music was a version of Yesterday played on pan pipes, rather than the version with Paul McCartney singing it. His much-loved rendition made callers too attentive; zombification is the key here. So does listening to music while we work help or hinder productivity? The answer depends on what you are doing: it helps with mechanical tasks but is distracting if you are carrying out complex cognitive tasks. And what is the safest music to listen to while driving? Heavy metal surprisingly. Just joking – ballads are best. • Turn It Up: The Power of Music is at the Science and Industry Museum, Manchester, until 21 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/jul/27/british-gas-record-profit-price-cap-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-27T11:23:10Z","webTitle":"British Gas reports record £969m profit after price cap increase","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/27/british-gas-record-profit-price-cap-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jul/27/british-gas-record-profit-price-cap-increase","fields":{"bodyText":"British Gas has reported its highest ever first-half profits, of almost £1bn, after the energy watchdog let it claw back more money from household bills. The UK’s biggest energy supplier reported profits of £969m for the first six months of 2023, up almost 900% from £98m in the same period last year. The profit boom was largely thanks to a tweak to the regulator Ofgem’s energy price cap that allowed the supplier to recoup some of the costs of supplying its 10 million customers during the energy crisis. Ofgem’s controversial decision to allow energy suppliers to claim greater profits from hard-hit customers via the energy price cap also led to a windfall for EDF Energy and Scottish Power. The French state-owned EDF reported that its UK business made profits of almost €2.3bn (£2bn) for the first half of the year – including the earnings from its nuclear power plants – up from €860m in the same months last year. It said this was driven mainly by the price cap. Scottish Power, which is owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, reported a profit of £576m for the first half of the year, from a loss of £86m last year. Paul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, said: “While families across Britain have struggled to pay their bills, energy companies have been allowed to laugh all the way to the bank.” A spokesperson for Ofgem described the profits as “a one-off” as suppliers recoup some of the significant costs and losses they incurred because of the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We expect profit levels to fall back significantly moving forward to the reasonable and modest levels allowed for in the price cap,” the spokesperson said. The windfall earned by British Gas helped its FTSE 100-listed parent company, Centrica, to a profit of £6.5bn for the first half of this year, compared with a £1.1bn loss in the same months last year. Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, said the windfall profits would be used to increase the supplier’s customer support package to more than £100m and invest “several billion pounds” in the energy transition. “I’m proud of the incredible work our colleagues do every day to help customers struggling with the cost of living crisis,” O’Shea said. “We are doing more than any other UK energy company and we will continue to be there when our customers need us.” Earlier this year, he was told to “examine his conscience” for accepting a £4.5m pay packet, including bonus payouts totalling £3.7m, after it emerged that debt agents working for British Gas had broken into the homes of vulnerable customers to fit prepayment meters when they were unable to pay their bills. The supplier’s record profits have angered consumer groups that have campaigned against its treatment of vulnerable energy customers as record energy market prices forced millions into fuel poverty. Simon Francis, a coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, called the profits “a further sign of Britain’s broken energy system”. He said: “At a time when household energy debt is spiralling to record levels and energy bills remain double what they were just a few years ago, the profits posted will be greeted with disbelief by those struggling through the crisis.” Francis called on the government to do more to insulate homes and switch towards cheap renewable energy to lower energy bills permanently. He also called for more support for households this winter. Centrica prompted outrage among campaigners after reporting a threefold profit rise last year to a record £3.3bn because of rising energy market prices that led to higher energy bills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T09:27:27Z","webTitle":"Kamala Harris hits out at North Korea’s ‘provocative nuclear rhetoric’ on DMZ visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/29/kamala-harris-hits-out-at-north-koreas-provocative-nuclear-rhetoric-on-dmz-visit","fields":{"bodyText":"The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, has condemned North Korea’s “provocative nuclear rhetoric” during a trip to South Korea that included a visit to the heavily armed border dividing the peninsula. Harris arrived in Seoul on Thursday, hours after North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, in a move that underlines Washington’s struggle to rein in the regime’s weapons programme. Her visit to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) – which has divided the peninsula since the 1950-1953 Korean war ended in an uneasy truce – was intended to demonstrate the US’s commitment to South Korea, a key ally in the region. Harris looked through binoculars as a South Korean colonel pointed out military installations on the southern side. An American colonel then pointed out some of the defences along the military demarcation line, which marks the boundary between the two Koreas, including barbed wire fences and mines. “It’s so close,” Harris said. Earlier, she told US military personnel at a nearby base “how grateful and thankful we are” for their role in protecting the southern side of the tense border between the two Koreas. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has overseen a record number of missile launches this year, including one that involved a long-range weapon. Officials in Seoul and Washington have warned that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a nuclear test. In a meeting in Seoul with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol, Harris praised the alliance between the two countries as a “linchpin of security and prosperity. I’m here to reinforce the strength of our alliance and strengthen our work together”. Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, called her visit “another turning point” in strengthening bilateral ties. They reaffirmed their commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and “condemned [North Korea’s] provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches, in violation of UN security council resolutions”, the White House said in a statement. “They discussed our response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral cooperation with Japan.” The DMZ has become a regular stop for visiting US officials eager to demonstrate their resolve on North Korean weapons’ development and their commitment to the security of South Korea, where 28,5000 US troops are based. The 155-mile (250km) long border is highly fortified with razor wire, heavy armaments and tank traps on either side of a 2.5-mile wide buffer. Ronald Reagan was the first US president to visit the DMZ, but Bill Clinton – who described it as “the scariest place on Earth” during a 1993 visit – and Donald Trump are the only sitting presidents to have visited the Joint Security Area, a cluster of buildings that hosts inter-Korean talks, and the only place where troops from both sides directly face each other. Harris’s visit comes at a time of rising tensions on the peninsula. This week, the US and South Korea launched large-scale naval exercises for the first time in five years. The allies insist that their joint drills are purely defensive, but North Korea routinely condemns them as rehearsals for an invasion. Earlier this week, Harris condemned Pyongyang’s “illicit weapons programme” during a speech at a naval base in Japan, where she also attended the state funeral of the country’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe. Speculation is building that North Korea is preparing to detonate a nuclear device in what would be its seventh nuclear test since 2006. Pyongyang claimed that its most recent test, in 2017, involved its most powerful weapon to date. This week, the South Korean spy agency said North Korea appeared to have completed a third tunnel at its Punggye-ri nuclear site as part of preparations for a test, according to a South Korean MP who attended a closed-door briefing by the National Intelligence Service. The lawmaker said Pyongyang was likely to conduct the test after the end of the Chinese Communist party congress, which begins on 16 October, and before US midterm elections on 8 November. Kim Jong-dae, of the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies, said the latest missile launches were an attempt by the regime “to gain an upper hand on the peninsula with a nuclear arsenal at its disposal”. That and other launches were “a harbinger of Pyongyang’s aggressive posturing to come next month – with missile launches and a possible nuclear test”, Kim added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T00:58:35Z","webTitle":"Ukraine faces power outages after ‘massive’ Russian strikes target energy facilities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/23/ukraine-faces-power-outages-after-massive-russian-strikes-target-energy-facilities","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had launched a “massive attack” on Ukraine, with some strikes reported on energy infrastructure that resulted in power outages across the country. More than a dozen Russian missiles pounded energy facilities and other infrastructure across Ukraine on Saturday, the Ukrainian air force said, with strikes causing blackouts in parts of different regions. Russian airstrikes on energy facilities across the country have left more than a million households in Ukraine without electricity, the deputy head of the Ukrainian presidency, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, said earlier on Saturday. Fresh strikes targeted energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s west, Ukraine’s energy operator Ukrenergo said on social media, and officials in several regions of the war-scarred country reported power outages. “These are vile strikes on critical objects,” Zelenskiy said earlier on Saturday. “The world can and must stop this terror.” Power outages were reported in other parts of the country and local officials repeated calls to reduce energy use. Some parts of Ukraine have already cut their electricity use by up to 20%, according to Ukrenergo. Parts of Kyiv suffered power cuts into the evening. In one central district, shops were closed and traffic lights were off. “The geography of this latest mass strike is very wide,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, citing regions in western, central and southern Ukraine. “Of course we don’t have the technical ability to knock down 100% of the Russian missiles and strike drones. I am sure that, gradually, we will achieve that, with help from our partners. Already now, we are downing a majority of cruise missiles, a majority of drones.” Ukrainian forces had downed 20 missiles and more than 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones on Saturday, Zelenskiy said. The air force command earlier had said 33 missiles had been fired at Ukraine. Eighteen were shot down. Most of the western city of Khmelnytskyi, which straddles the Bug River and had a pre-war population of 275,000, was left with no electricity, shortly after local media reported several loud explosions. In a social media post on Saturday, the city council urged local residents to store water “in case it’s also gone within an hour.” In the Russian Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, at least two civilians were killed in strikes on Saturday, according to the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Nearly 15,000 people were left without electricity, he said. Russia last week reported a “considerable increase” in Ukrainian fire into its territory, saying attacks had largely concentrated on the Belgorod region and neighbouring regions of Bryansk and Kursk. Reuters witnesses in the southern city of Mykolaiv reported a power cut over several hours, disrupting mobile phone signals. In the south-eastern city of Nikopol, which is regularly shelled from Russian positions across the Dnieper River, local authorities warned that air raid sirens would be switched off as a result of power cuts. Instead, emergency vehicles driving around the city would warn of incoming aerial threats, officials said. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said Moscow wanted to create a new wave of refugees into Europe with the strikes, while the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Twitter that the attacks constituted genocide. Moscow has acknowledged targeting energy infrastructure but denies targeting civilians. State grid operator Ukrenergo said the attacks targeted transmission infrastructure in western Ukraine, but that supply restrictions were imposed in 10 regions, including in Kyiv. “The scale of damage is comparable or may exceed the consequences of the attacks [between] October 10-12,” Ukrenergo wrote on the Telegram app, referring to the first wave of strikes on the power system last week. The deputy head of Kyiv’s city administration, Petro Panteleev, warned that Russian strikes could leave Ukraine’s capital without power and heat for “several days or weeks”.

The Post, citing unnamed sources, did not identify the foreign government named in the document describing the country’s military defenses. The content of the more than 11,000 government documents and photographs FBI agents recovered from Donald Trump’s Florida estate last month has not been revealed, but previous reporting from the Post indicated classified documents about nuclear weapons were among the items federal authorities were looking for. Some of the records seized from Donald Trump’s Florida estate are typically closely guarded, the newspaper reported, and have “a designated control officer” to monitor the documents’ location. Among the records recovered by the FBI were documents detailing top-secret US operations that require special clearances “on a need-to-know basis”, beyond a top-secret clearance, according to the Post report. Some of the Biden administration’s most senior national security officials were not authorized to review some of the documents because they are so restricted, the Post said. Trump is under investigation by the justice department for his unauthorized removal of highly sensitive government records from the White House and for allegedly improperly storing them at Mar-a-Lago. The findings are the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that began when US government agents conducted an unprecedented search of the former president’s Florida home. Trump has attacked the department, including at a weekend rally where he called the FBI and DoJ “vicious monsters”. Many others, including Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have defended the investigation into his retention of government records, saying that it posed a major national security risk. A federal judge recently granted Trump’s request for the appointment of a special master to review the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago on 8 August. The decision by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, temporarily prevented the justice department from reviewing records for its criminal inquiry until after the the special master’s review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/20/national-grid-to-pay-households-more-to-use-off-peak-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"National Grid to pay households more to use off-peak power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/20/national-grid-to-pay-households-more-to-use-off-peak-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/20/national-grid-to-pay-households-more-to-use-off-peak-power","fields":{"bodyText":"National Grid has significantly increased its financial incentive for households that shift their power usage away from peak times as part of a renewed effort to prevent rolling power cuts. Its electricity system operator (ESO) has increased the incentive sixfold to £3 per kilowatt hour (kWh) to encourage households to use their washing machines and appliances late at night, which could mean typical savings of £100 this winter. National Grid warned this month that homes could face three-hour power cuts if Russia blocks gas supplies into Europe and Britain experiences sustained cold weather, increasing the amount that households use for heating. In response, it has beefed up plans for businesses and households to participate in its “demand flexibility service”, which launches next month. Writing exclusively for the Guardian, Fintan Slye, the director of National Grid ESO, said on Thursday: “Businesses and homes can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too. “For a consumer that could mean a typical household could save approximately £100 and, for industrial and commercial businesses with larger energy usage, they could potentially save multiples of this.” The ESO had originally planned to pay households with smart meters about 52p per kilowatt hour in credit via their energy suppliers if they avoid using appliances at times when high demand puts strain on the system. However, the introduction of support for businesses and households announced by Liz Truss last month made the scheme less attractive, at the equivalent of 34p per kWh. As a result, the ESO said it expects to pay the equivalent of £3 per kWh, “as feedback indicates this will unlock the majority of the available volume”. This money will be paid to suppliers in the form of a £3,000 per megawatt hour (MWh) minimum price, and those payments could go higher. Slye said he was “confident” the scheme could free up about 2 gigawatts (GW) of power, enough for about 1m homes. As businesses consume far more energy than domestic customers, their savings could be much higher. Only Octopus Energy, which piloted the initiative earlier this year, has formally signed up. However, it is understood E.ON and Ovo are among those interested in signing up. Under a similar scheme also launching next month, Ovo customers who use less than 12.5% of the energy they consume in a day between the peak hours of 4pm and 7pm will receive £20 for each month they hit this target. The five-month trial from 1 November could save them £100 as a result. The more firms and homes that sign up to the ESO plan, the greater the reduction in the pressure on the energy network with consumers putting on their washing machine or appliances at night instead of busier periods. Octopus and E.ON had claimed the energy discount incentive was too low, arguing that fewer people would sign up as a result, the Times reported last month. Slye also detailed how National Grid would inform households if there were to be power cuts this winter. He said consumers would receive 24 hours notice and social media influencers could even be called on to spread the message. He wrote: “We are working with government and industry on planning for this so that the message can be spread across all communities as quickly and accurately as possible. This would include press conferences, social media campaigns, and working with influencers in different communities.” • This article was amended on 21 October 2022 because an earlier version referred to kWh units as kW/h."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T02:49:56Z","webTitle":"Richard Marles condemns Russia’s ‘appalling’ nuclear threat and pledges long-term Ukraine support","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/25/richard-marles-condemns-russias-appalling-nuclear-threat-and-pledges-long-term-ukraine-support","fields":{"bodyText":"The defence minister, Richard Marles, has condemned the latest nuclear threat from Russia as “appalling”, and says Australia is preparing to support Ukraine for a protracted military conflict. Speaking on Sunday, the deputy prime minister said the threat from the Russian president Vladimir Putin last week to use the country’s nuclear arsenal as part of its ongoing war with Ukraine could “not be allowed to stand”. “Certainly the comments cause anxiety, you can’t hide from that,” Marles told Sky News. “We’ve heard the president make those threats before [and] they are appalling comments to make. “It is clearly an appalling thing to do, to place that potential on the table.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a televised address to the nation last week, Putin said that Russia was positioning itself in response to the threat from the west, which “wants to destroy our country”, as he threatened to use the “various means of destruction” it had at its disposal. “When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal,” Putin said. “It’s not a bluff.” The comments sparked widespread condemnation and the threat of more sanctions from G7 countries, while the foreign minister, Penny Wong, suggested the government would consider the expulsion of the Russian ambassador in response. Amid the escalation, Marles was also critical of Putin’s decision to mobilise 300,000 reservists, describing the move as “a step in completely the wrong direction.” “Russia needs to stop and Russia needs to leave Ukraine,” he said. “I think the scenes that we’ve seen from Russia over the last few days, of people seeking to leave the country, of obvious distress for those being called up and being asked to serve in the Russian forces in respect of this says everything about where public opinion is actually at within Russia.” Marles, who has recently met with officials from Nato countries in Europe, also said Australia would provide further and ongoing military assistance to Ukraine. It follows requests from the country’s ambassador for 30 more Bushmaster armoured vehicles, 30 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles and Howitzer missiles. He said he would not yet reveal the details of Australia’s military commitment, but confirmed there would be additional support. “What we understand is that Ukraine is going to need support over a long period of time,” Marles said. “That’s very much the sense when I was in Europe and speaking to Nato countries – Germany, UK, France – all of those countries are really steeling themselves for this being an effort which needs to be undertaken over a long period of time, and that the importance of standing with Ukraine and enabling Ukraine to be empowered to resolve this on their own terms is fundamentally important. “Rest assured that we’re talking with the Ukrainian ambassador, talking with Ukrainian government, about the way in which Australia can be there and be there over the long term, because we get that this has all the potential to be a protracted conflict.” Marles also rejected suggestions from the federal opposition that the delivery of Bushmaster vehicles to Ukraine had been delayed by red tape, saying the project schedule was “on time”. “The Ukrainians are very appreciative with the speed with which Bushmasters have been delivered to Ukraine,” he said. “It’s not in Ukraine’s interest for us to make public what that delivery schedule is. But the delivery schedule is there. It’s on time and they’re getting those Bushmasters. And they’re having a really big impact.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/09/defence-budget-2023-strategic-review-australia-aukus","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T10:02:55Z","webTitle":"Federal budget squirrels away $30bn to lift defence funding over decade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/defence-budget-2023-strategic-review-australia-aukus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/defence-budget-2023-strategic-review-australia-aukus","fields":{"bodyText":"The federal government has squirrelled away more than $30bn to lift defence funding over the coming decade, as the Aukus project helps drive spending increases. Defence funding as a share of the economy is expected to grow from 2.04% now to 2.3% in a decade’s time. The government has repeatedly said the funding for the nuclear-powered submarines and the defence strategic review will be budget-neutral over the first four years because of other cuts it has made within the portfolio. Spending announced so far includes $19bn over the coming four years “for nuclear-powered submarines, long-range strike capabilities, strengthened northern bases, workforce growth and retention, innovation, and regional partnerships”. But overall defence funding as a share of gross domestic product is expected to remain fairly constant over the first four years, with costs ramping up after that point. The budget papers reveal the government “has included a spending provision in the contingency reserve for increased defence funding over the medium term to implement the defence strategic review”. Officials confirmed that this additional spending provision was worth $30.5bn between the 2027-28 and 2032-33 financial years. This will mean defence funding reaches 2.3% of gross domestic product at the end of this 10-year period. The government says this is 0.2% higher than the trajectory Labor inherited from the Coalition. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Key decisions loom when the government prepares a new national defence strategy in 2024. The government has not ruled out further cuts within defence to fund higher priorities. The defence minister, Richard Marles, said the government had “made no secret that we are willing to make the hard decisions in order to get the best outcome for our ADF”. Tuesday night’s budget lists Aukus as one of numerous “fiscal risks” the government will need to manage. The budget does not adjust the long-term estimate that the submarine project will cost between $268bn and $368bn over the period from now to the mid-2050s. This figure includes $9bn over the first four-year budget period – and between $50bn and $58bn over the first 10 years. But while Tuesday’s budget includes funding for some initial Aukus costs, officials included a warning about the uncertainty surrounding the complex multi-decade program. “The total costs associated with the program will not be known until design and production processes are settled and commercial and other arrangements are finalised between governments and delivery partners,” the budget papers warn. Of initial funding that is certain, the government has earmarked $4.5bn over 10 years “to support the initial steps in Australia’s acquisition of a conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability”. The majority of this – $4.2bn – is to establish and fund the operations of a new Australian submarine agency to manage the overall program. The government has earmarked $127m over four years for 4,000 additional commonwealth-supported places at universities and other higher education providers “for courses that support the skills requirements of the nuclear-powered submarine program, including STEM and management disciplines”. At least 800 of these places will be reserved for South Australian universities. The government is promising $11m over three years to extend the defence industry pathways program within the shipbuilding sector of Western Australia. The Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office will get $22m in funding over two years “to support the establishment of non-proliferation and safeguard arrangements with the International Atomic Energy Agency”. There will be $5.2m for the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency “to support the development of radioactive waste management, storage and disposal arrangements”. The government has decided to provide Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd with an equity injection “to commence early construction and design works for a submarine construction yard and to design the Skills and Training Academy in South Australia”. But the government is refusing to break down that amount because of “commercial sensitivities”. The defence budget also includes an extra $190m over two years to provide assistance to Ukraine fighting the invasion by Russia, about $40m of which relates to measures that are yet to be announced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T14:00:27Z","webTitle":"Coal-fired power plants could receive bulk of price cap compensation, Treasury briefings suggest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/coal-fired-power-plants-could-receive-bulk-of-price-cap-compensation-treasury-briefings-suggest","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government’s plan to compensate New South Wales and Queensland for imposing a cap on coal prices could run “significantly” above $500m with most of the money directed to coal-fired power plants, according to Treasury briefings. The compensation for the $125 a tonne price cap for black coal is part of the package announced by the government on Friday to lower energy prices. There would be compensation for coalminers but the bulk of the money would be for power stations, sources say. “The generators would get the lion’s share,” one of those briefed told Guardian Australia. “It could be significantly higher than $500m,” they said, with the figure possibly running to hundreds of millions of dollars more. NSW generators could receive as much as $250m, one NSW official said. Black coal-fired power plants contract most of their coal at long-term rates below $125 but some contracts are above that price – hence the compensation. The federal government has so far downplayed the potential of a big payment for those affected by the price cap on coal. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, told the ABC on Monday “there’s nothing in the legislation” that provides compensation. However, Albanese said if fossil fuel companies faced production costs above $125 a tonne “it is reasonable that there be payments made” to ensure continued supply. The Nine newspapers reported on Sunday the government could spend up to $500m to compensate producers affected by the coal price caps. The federal industry minister, Ed Husic, on Tuesday did not specifically rule out compensation to coal companies but said this week’s legislation was focused on gas. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The office of the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, highlighted comments he made earlier on Tuesday that “a range of mechanisms” could be applied to set the coal price – a power that resides with states. “The NSW government has asked us to ensure that any coal company which has a genuine cost of production over $125 is catered for,” Bowen said. “We think that is a very, very rare circumstance.” Albanese on Tuesday also expressed support for a federal gas reservation policy. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said his party would not support compensation for coal. He urged the government to provide more detail on its plan and reiterated calls for a windfall profits tax on fossil fuels. He said the Greens hoped to reach an agreement before parliament resumed on Thursday. The Greens and the Coalition have asked for more detail on exactly what legislation will be introduced. “We want to see people get energy bill relief, but we still have concerns about Labor’s plan,” Bandt said. “People deserve lower power bills, but massive coal and gas corporations don’t deserve a cent of public money.” The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union secretary, Steve Murphy, said any payment or supply incentive made to suppliers must benefit consumers, not become a “corporate handout”. “Giving half a billion dollars to some of the richest CEOs in the country without clear and enforceable conditions would do nothing to help workers or bring prices down,” he said. The government will introduce a bill to cap gas prices at a special sitting of parliament on Thursday. Commonwealth funds to support rebates for households and small businesses will be included as a schedule to the bill. The schedule will enable agreements to be entered into between the commonwealth and each of the states and territories to provide energy price relief, and the funding will be provided in relation to the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 financial years up to $1.5bn. Details of the rebates are yet to be settled. The arrangements will be determined by the federal and state treasurers. Senators are negotiating how long the debate could continue and whether it would be gagged to avoid sitting late into Thursday night. Major energy companies said they remained in the dark about how the policy might affect their operations. Gas firms have been public in their opposition to the proposed “reasonable pricing” mechanism contained within the amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act that parliament will vote on. One of those briefed by Treasury said compensation for coalminers was unlikely to exceed several tens of millions of dollars. Treasury officials told journalists on Friday the $125 cap had been chosen because few miners would be out of pocket. Their main contracts with foreign or domestic customers would not be affected by the energy package. Guardian Australia understands NSW continues to negotiate over the terms for its state. Major generators, too, were unsure how the policy would affect them. “We’re still trying to understand a lot of this stuff,” one senior source said. “There is not any certainty.” A senior official at another company said they wanted to know whether rivals would essentially be bailed out for poorly managing coal supplies. Their firm had long-term contracts for most of its coal at less than $125 a tonne but had been buying extra fuel well above that price to ensure supply in case of disruptions. The official questioned the wisdom of making it cheaper for consumers to use fossil fuels. The government’s plan “encourages more burning of coal and gas”, they said. The government would in effect be acting as a contracting party, picking up the risk and price gap for generators if there is one, said Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre. Uncertainty over those factors is one reason why the quantity of compensation to generators may be difficult to model. If the price caps for coal and gas remained beyond the end of June 2024 – the current schedule for the temporary measures – they could discourage the transition to zero-carbon options such as big batteries. Another person briefed by Treasury said the government was assuming the war in Ukraine would be over in a year’s time – with global energy prices subsequently falling. However, countries would be reluctant to return to sourcing energy from Russia given the risks. Simon Corbell, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group and a former deputy ACT chief minister, said his organisation welcomed the short-term price caps as “a reasonable measure”. But “a long-term intervention could dampen investment signals for next-generation storage and new-build renewable generation”, he said. Over time, the government should work to reduce the risks for clean energy investments such as setting a clearer timeframe for the orderly exit of coal-fired power plants, and the construction of transmission lines to link up new wind and solar farms and avoid unnecessary congestion and curtailment, Corbell said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:34:04Z","webTitle":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","fields":{"bodyText":"As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it’s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain’s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country’s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe’s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a “dark lull”) conditions – with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days – left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain’s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving – the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government’s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: “It could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues – that’s why we have seen gas prices go up.” He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain’s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass – particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire – and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica’s Rough – shut down after the government refused to support it – have also been called into action, although Britain’s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors – the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron’s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). “It may not come down to resource nationalism,” Piper says. “If France doesn’t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.” Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated £18m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over “nanny state intervention” against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: “As we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn’t be more important – both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. “The government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.” Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry’s first big test of an extraordinary winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-09T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Stalking the Atomic City by Markiyan Kamysh review – in search of meaning in Chornobyl’s forbidden wasteland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","fields":{"bodyText":"The area around Chornobyl was once meant to be a paradise. “They even planned to build a promenade with bridges, street lights and musical entertainment. They already started to lay the foundation of new power plant units, the apotheosis of joy and happiness looming on the horizon,” writes Markiyan Kamysh. “Until,” he says, with characteristic directness, “things got fucked and reactor number 4 blew the hell up.” Kamysh was born in 1988, two years after that calamity, the son of a nuclear physicist who had been brought in to work as a liquidator after the meltdown. The families of liquidators were given social benefits, and cheaper food – but this association was also a source of radioactive stigma, not to mention ill health. Kamysh’s father died in 2003. A few years later Kamysh dropped out of university in Kyiv to dedicate himself to literature and the exploration of the exclusion zone around Chornobyl – as well as the disaster’s fallout in his own psyche. He also started leading other people into the forbidden territory around the reactor, evading the police and ducking under wire fences, acting like a real-life version of the guides who take people to a forbidden area in Andrei Tarkovsky’s mysterious sci-fi film Stalker. Kamysh undertook those trips for money, but in this account, which he wrote between 2012 and 2014, he also describes the fallout zone as somewhere he can “relax”. He goes there to drink with friends, to celebrate New Year’s Eve, to wander alone among the ruins. He brings back descriptions of empty streets, the “jungles” that are spreading across the landscape, the cries of wolves in the night. Kamysh describes himself as a “degenerate”. On his trips into the zone he drinks and destroys. He makes fires with old physics textbooks and burns floorboards for heating. He smashes windows. He has a terrifying disregard for his own safety. He even jokes about meeting other stalkers in cancer wards in 20 years’ time. He can be brutally funny (credit for this must go partly to translators Hanna Leliv and Reilly Costigan-Humes), but he also demands serious attention. To those asking if he’s afraid of radiation, he says: “No. It’s only here that life won’t slip by for me, for I’m living it in the most exotic place on Earth.” By the time we get to that explanation, late on in this remarkable book, Kamysh has made us understand why he thinks the zone around Chornobyl is so special, why – because of its desolate serenity, and the freedom it grants from the strictures of normal life – it may even be worth dying for. No mean feat. It’s all the more unsettling to read about this bargain with death now that invading Russian troops have also blundered into his poisoned paradise. At least Kamysh had a choice, strange as it may seem. • Stalking the Atomic City: Life Among the Decadent and Depraved of Chornobyl by Markiyan Kamysh is published by Pushkin Press (£12.99).

But she knows what she wants to do with it. “While I’m still breathing, I’d like to get some action on solar panels for people in public housing, because it’s just terrible at the moment,” she says. The 73-year-old public housing resident has spent more than a decade advocating for improved living conditions for public tenants in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. She says with the cost of living soaring, she has never seen so many people doing it so tough. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “A lot of people around here are getting help from the Salvos and neighbourhood houses with food, especially pensioners. How are they supposed to pay their power bills, medication, groceries when it’s all going up by so much?” Rabey says. “I know some people are just not turning their heaters on in winter, while the ones who have air conditioners, they don’t use them at all in the summer because they can’t afford to. Others are just switching everything off.” For Rabey, this is not an option. She has permanent scarring on her lungs following a viral infection that put her in hospital for nine weeks. As a result, she needs to use an oxygen machine and run two air purifiers and a compressor 24 hours a day. “I don’t know what it’s going cost me as we head into winter because I have to keep the heating on throughout the night, because otherwise in the morning it’s freezing and I start coughing up,” Rabey says. She is backing a push by the Victorian Public Tenants’ Association to install solar panels on every public housing property in the state. In its state budget submission, the VPTA, the peak body representing existing public housing renters and those on the waitlist, estimates 23,500 existing public housing properties are suitable for installation of rooftop solar panels. It could save each household up to $535.49 each year in energy bills. The VPTA chief executive, Katelyn Butterss, said the proposal would tackle cost-of-living pressures for low-income households, help Victoria reach its emissions reductions targets, and create more than 1,000 jobs. “Homeowners, people who live in community housing and those in private rentals have had an opportunity to access subsidised solar panel installations, while the tenants of Victoria’s biggest landlord – the director of housing – are the only people left behind,” she said. “It’s time they also reaped the benefits.” The VPTA’s submission also calls for a program that would see vacant property owners lease their homes to the government for temporary inclusion in the public housing stock for up to 15 years. The government would pay participants market rent plus 1%. To encourage owners to join the program, the government could increase the vacant residential land tax or apply it to more parts of the state, the submission states. Butterss said the idea followed the release of 2021 census figures last year, which showed there were 1m unoccupied properties across Australia – or 10% of all housing stock – on census night. “That’s really hard to reconcile when in Victoria, there are more than 100,000 individual Victorians waiting for access to safe, secure, affordable housing,” she said. She described the proposal as a “stopgap” until the government’s $5.3bn “Big Housing Build” to construct more than 12,000 new homes eventuates. However, she warned it was likely these new properties would make only a small dent on the “very swollen waitlist”. Rabey is keen to stress that most people in public housing don’t want to be there. “Sometimes stuff happens to people in their lives that they can’t control,” she says. “I only ended up here because my brother’s business went down. That’s life. So we should try to make it a bit easier when we can.” “I don’t know how long I have left but I want to see this one through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T12:32:18Z","webTitle":"The march on Rome and Mussolini’s ascent to power – archive, October 1922","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/19/march-on-rome-and-coming-to-power-of-mussolini-1922","fields":{"bodyText":"Italy in fascist control: swift surrender of the government 30 October 1922 At the moment when Mussolini, the leader of the Italian fascisti, was seizing control of the country by force, the government’s authority has been placed in his hands by the king, who yesterday asked him to form a cabinet. On Saturday, while Mussolini ordered a general mobilisation of his more or less armed force of nearly half a million men, the cabinet decided upon measures of resistance – with certain reservations. The military were ordered to hold Rome against attack, but to give some latitude to the revolutionaries in the provinces. Martial law was ordered to be proclaimed throughout the country from midday on Saturday, but before the day was out the order was rescinded. The situation had become too bad for remedy, and the king, recognising this, refused to sign the decree. Continue reading. Editorial: The fascist triumph 30 October 1922 Signor Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, has been invited to form a government. If an English political leader of any party organised armed followers throughout the country and on the occasion of a cabinet crisis ordered a “general mobilisation” and seized government offices in the important towns, so that Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands were under his control, and if under threat of war the King were to invite him to form a government of his own, we might congratulate ourselves, as they appear to be doing in Italy, that this military occupation had been achieved “without disorder,” and we might call the “solution of the crisis” by any names we chose, but we should in reality have submitted to revolution. Continue reading. Foreign 31 October 1922 Signor Mussolini, the leader of the Italian fascists, after an interview with King Victor at the Quirinal yesterday, assumed the premiership and formed a cabinet. He himself has taken over the ministries of the interior and foreign affairs, while appointing seven other fascists to office. Editorial: a bloodless revolution 31 October 1922 The part of an English observer of the Italian crisis is at the moment to study it in a spirit of sympathy for Italy, for the nation as a whole, not for a section of it. If the triumph of Signor Mussolini, the fascist leader, is confirmed, it will have reactions of an unknown extent on international affairs and, therefore, on British interests and policy. But that may wait. At present we are concerned rather to understand what has been happening and why it is that the fascists, who at the Armistice did not exist, have now overthrown constitutional government by threat of force, impelled the King to reject the advice of his ministers, and established themselves in power. We may congratulate Italy that she has so far escaped bloodshed. The discipline of the fascists has been good, their success in the occupation of important towns was immediate, and the action of the King perhaps averted what chance there was of civil war. Office and responsibility are apt to exercise a sobering influence on un-sober minds, and some utterances are already attributed to the new Premier which suggest that he may pursue a policy more moderate than the speeches he has sometimes made. That remains to be seen. Meanwhile we may as well begin by recognising what has happened in Italy. Signor Mussolini has been victorious by a coup d’état, by the exercise of unconstitutional violence. A London newspaper, referring to the failure of the communists since their seizure of the factories last year, remarks that “the policy of Direct Action has been utterly discomfited.” It has, of course, been completely successful. The quality of Direct Action does not depend on whether one likes either the methods or the noses of one particular section of Direct Actionists. Signor Mussolini has used extra-legal means to impose his government on the country. He is as good a constitutionalist as Lenin, and no more. Of Mussolini’s policy the little that is known is not encouraging. At home the mainspring of the movement has been anti-socialism, which has taken the form of destroying the property of socialist institutions and ejecting socialist officials from the posts to which they had been legally elected. If this method should be elevated into a principle of government by a ministry founded upon a threat of war, “force begets force” will be its epitaph. Abroad they proclaim a flamboyant nationalist policy of the sort for which no other people has had much stomach since the war. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Anxiety in Paris From our own correspondent 31 October 1922 Paris, Monday News of the fascist coup d’état has been received here with mistrust and alarm. Those conservatives who admired fascism and attempted to preach the necessity of such an institution for France as a defence against the bugbear of socialism are ill at ease. The Liberté which only a few months ago published a series of laudatory articles on Signor Mussolini’s society, to-day says:- “Benito Mussolini, an ex-socialist turned patriot, an avowed republican and a politician ambitious for Caesar’s laurels, has commenced an era of great adventures which will forge the future history of Italy. With sincere friendship for our Roman sister, let us hope that he may not prove the Lafayette of the great revolution that is beginning.” The Temps, which is more discreet, grieves over the lack of respect for constitutional methods. “Wreckage may churn up foam, but it is wind itself that moves the sea,” it adds. Diplomats in Paris are dismayed at this “new woe”, while Italians in Paris are depressed. It seems to be generally held that Mussolini has no real programme, and it is feared he may resort to war or threaten war against Jugo-Slavia to keep his followers together. Criticisms are levelled against the King of Italy for his action in yielding to the fascists and refusing to support the ministry. Naturally socialists and communists here have exhausted their vocabulary of abuse against Mussolini “and his band of turbulent schoolboys and blackleg workmen”. A new and incalculable factor in the already fearfully difficult European situation has appeared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T03:48:57Z","webTitle":"Russian forces capture Ukraine’s second-biggest power station ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/28/russian-forces-capture-vuhlehirska-ukraine-second-biggest-power-station-donetsk","fields":{"bodyText":"Russian forces have taken over Ukraine’s second-biggest power plant and are conducting a “massive redeployment” of troops to three southern regions, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said, amid expectations of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. Russian-backed forces said on Wednesday they had captured intact the Soviet-era coal-fired Vuhlehirska power plant, in what is Moscow’s first significant gain in more than three weeks. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed the capture of the plant in the eastern Donetsk region, but said it was only a “tiny tactical advantage” for Russia. The Russian redeployment to the south appeared to be a switch from offence to strategic defence, he added, with troops sent to the Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Ukraine has made clear it intends to recapture the southern city of Kherson, which fell to Russia in the early days of the war. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, earlier tweeted that Russia was concentrating “the maximum number of troops” in the direction of Kherson but gave no details. Arestovych also said Ukraine’s operation to liberate Kherson “has already begun” after striking the Antonivskiy Bridge – a key Russian supply route into the Russian-occupied southern city on Wednesday. In a Wednesday evening address, Zelenskiy said: “We are doing everything to ensure that the occupying forces do not have any logistical opportunities in our country”, and promised to rebuild the Antonivskiy Bridge and other crossings in the region. Russian officials earlier said they would turn instead to pontoon bridges and ferries to get forces across the river. Arestovych also confirmed Ukraine’s strategy to isolate Russian forces, saying in an interview with Ukrainian television on Wednesday night that there was a “certain plan” of the armed forces of Ukraine to “isolate [Russia’s] military operations”. “No matter how much the enemy overtakes forces and resources on the western bank of the Dnieper, the Armed Forces of Ukraine will first leave them without ammunition depots, fuel, communications and command, and then they will clean up the remnants of their forces,” he said, adding that Russian forces had three options: “Retreat (if possible), surrender or be destroyed.” Another senior presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, added: “Occupiers should learn how to swim across the Dnieper river. Or should leave Kherson while it is still possible. There may not be a third warning.” Ukrainian forces in the south said they had killed 66 enemy troops and destroyed three tanks and two arms dumps in the past 24 hours. Russian forces attacked the city of Mykolaiv with multiple rocket launchers, they added. Reuters was unable to verify the battlefield reports. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said he planned a phone conversation with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov – the first between the two diplomats since before the start of the war. The call in the coming days would not be “a negotiation about Ukraine”, Blinken said at a news conference, restating Washington’s position that any talks on ending the war must be between Kyiv and Moscow. Aside from discussing Americans detained by Russia, Blinken said he would raise with Lavrov the tentative deal on grain exports reached last week between Russia, the US, Turkey and Ukraine. Russia has received no formal request from Washington about a phone call between Blinken and Lavrov, Tass news agency reported. The US has made “a substantial offer” to Russia for it to release two US citizens, WNBA star Brittney Griner and former US Marine Paul Whelan, Blinken said, without giving details of what the US was offering in return. Blinken said he would press Lavrov to respond to the offer. A source familiar with the situation confirmed a CNN report that Washington was willing to exchange Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence in the US, as part of a deal. The last publicly recognised contact between Blinken and Lavrov was 22 February, when Blinken wrote to Lavrov to cancel a meeting they had planned as a last-ditch effort to avert the Russian invasion, saying Moscow had shown no interest in serious diplomacy on the matter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T05:56:10Z","webTitle":"Power bill relief all round as major parties launch Victorian election campaigns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/13/power-bill-relief-all-round-as-major-parties-launch-victorian-election-campaigns","fields":{"bodyText":"Bringing down the cost of power bills was a central theme at both Labor and the Coalition’s Victorian election campaign launches, with the premier, Daniel Andrews, pledging another $250 payment for households, while the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, vowed to temporarily scrap supply charges and reserve new gas supplies. With two weeks of electioneering to go, the first to address party faithful on Sunday was Guy, who announced the Coalition would restrict newly discovered Victorian gas from being exported overseas or interstate. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Victoria must turbocharge gas production and availability – not turn it off,” he told supporters in Port Melbourne. “A guaranteed supply of natural gas means we can keep the lights on and keep energy affordable while we transition to a clean energy future.” Guy acknowledged the plan would “take time to work through the energy market”, so in the interim, the Coalition would cover electricity supply charges on power bills for the first six months of 2023, saving households an estimated $235. “I would have liked to provide this for longer, more than 12 months if we could, but the state of Victoria’s finances after eight long years under Daniel Andrews means we simply can’t afford to do it,” he said. Within an hour, the policy was trumped by Andrews’ announcement that, if Labor is re-elected, each Victorian household that seeks a better power deal will be able to claim another power-saving bonus of $250 off their electricity bills from March 2023. “Private energy companies rely on people not getting the best deal on their power. In fact, they bank on it. It will mean more money in your pocket now plus savings, each year, every year,” Andrews said. “Because that’s the difference – while some value profits, we value people.” Labor’s campaign launch, at the Cranbourne Community Theatre in Melbourne’s south-east, largely focused on its announcement it will revive the publicly-owned State Electricity Commission (SEC). Andrews on Sunday announced 6,000 of the 59,000 jobs expected to be created by the SEC’s revival would be dedicated to apprentices and trainees, while local content requirements on state-owned and supported renewable energy projects – worth at least $5bn by 2035 – will ensure them a “long-term pipeline of work”. “It’s no coincidence that ever since privatisation we’ve seen shortages in so many trades. Our new SEC will help us find the next generation of tradespeople: maintenance workers, lineys, electricians – but also welders, painters and mechanics. Highly-qualified, highly-paid workers – working not for profit, but for people,” he said. Andrews said as part of an overhaul of vocational education, a Tafe course in clean energywill be added to the list of courses subsidised by the government. Students in Year 9 and 10 will also be supported to undergo a week of work experience in the sector, alongside other careers like nursing, trades and early childhood education. A $207m package for the state’s specialist schools was also announced. The package includes the the rollout of after-school care, the creation of dedicated onsite spaces for allied health appointments, more extracurricular activities, therapy animals and software to help non-verbal kids express themselves. Labor will also employ “NDIS navigators” to help families navigate the system, and will offer 1,000 scholarships to allied healthcare workers in regional Victoria. “After nine years of a Liberal government in Canberra, the NDIS is not working,” Andrews said. Former premiers Steve Bracks and John Brumby attended the launch, as well as former ministers James Merlino and Martin Pakula, who announced they were retiring earlier this year. The premier was introduced by wife, Catherine, and children, Noah, Grace and Joseph, and his mother, Jan, was in the crowd. “She’s someone who believes profoundly in the power of connection that every individual that’s held back, holds us all back and that every person who reaches their full potential helps us reach our own,” Andrews said of his mother. The Coalition launch, meanwhile, was attended by Guy’s wife Renee, his sons Joey, Sam and Alex, his parents and in-laws, as well as former premier Ted Baillieu – the last Liberal leader to win an election from opposition, a task Guy described as the “hardest” in politics. “It’s like climbing Mount Everest without oxygen and here in Victoria, Labor have been in government for 19 of the past 23 years, it’s like doing it all in a blizzard – all backwards,” he said. “But for the sake of all those people impacted by Daniel Andrews and his world-record lockdowns, we must win this election.” Guy said there was a “growing wave of anger and resentment” against the premier in the state that makes him “more and more confident” that the Coalition will win the election. The state goes to the polls on 26 November, with early voting beginning on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/nato-should-not-enter-war-ukraine-observer-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-16T05:01:04Z","webTitle":"Nato should not enter the war – and here’s why | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/nato-should-not-enter-war-ukraine-observer-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2023/jul/16/nato-should-not-enter-war-ukraine-observer-letters","fields":{"bodyText":"Despite his caveats, Simon Tisdall is in effect making a case for Nato to go to war with Russia (“Defeat for Ukraine would be a global disaster. Nato must finally step in”, Foreign Affairs Commentary). I believe that such a course of action would prove detrimental to western interests. If the Ukrainian counteroffensive fails to attain its ambitious objectives, no amount of western aid will allow Kyiv to prevail – including the controversial cluster munitions, that Washington is making available to the Ukrainians at the expense of its own soft power. The real choice facing the west is between a direct involvement of Nato and an end to hostilities through a peace treaty or an armistice of indefinite duration. Both the latter alternatives imply the sacrifice of sovereign Ukrainian territory, and will be resisted by the Ukrainians if they are led to believe that Nato will openly enter the war on their side. A direct western involvement, however, would be unwise for more than one reason: the danger of nuclear escalation; in the unlikely event Putin succumbs to a coup or a revolt, his successors will almost certainly prove more extremist – and perhaps incapable of keeping the federation together, and its gigantic nuclear arsenal under control; and Russia would become a Chinese satellite – despite the very real, underlying issues between Moscow and Beijing. It is fortunate that Joe Biden has wisely precluded Ukraine’s Nato membership. George Sekeris, former ambassador of Greece to Nato Nafplio, Greece I could not agree more with Simon Tisdall. There are many who have been duped by Putin’s baseless projections of power, but his military failures in Ukraine show that Russian maskirovka [military deception] is the real threat. Tisdall mentions that Ukraine could have been admitted into Nato 15 years ago, and it’s tragic that this did not happen. However, Nato could have prevented this war by sending a deterrent force into Ukraine in January 2022, when it was clear that Russia was massing forces for an invasion. Putin projected vast military power. This projection rapidly collapsed, with Russia’s best troops retreating after reaching the suburbs of Kyiv. But unfounded acceptance of Putin’s disinformation had devastating consequences for Ukraine. For 500 days, Nato and other western institutions have made decisions at an agonisingly slow pace. This, too, is a reflection of the west’s unfounded fear of Russia, that has allowed Putin’s thugs to act with impunity and entrench along a 1,000km frontline. Our so-called leaders in Europe and the US must summon the courage to see through Putin’s mask. David Bowman Fairfield, Idaho, US Riveting Kabul testimonies Barbara Ellen wonders why there weren’t more civilian voices heard during the brilliant series Evacuation, about the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 (Television reviews). It focused on firsthand experiences by military personnel, which is rare, revealing and riveting. We didn’t need the terrified voices of victims or survivors: it was vividly obvious what people were being subjected to in the shameful, violent chaos. The last thing needed was some fatuous interviewer asking the gratuitous “how do you feel?”. We had the very moving account from a family who had managed to flee to Britain. They said it all. The traumatic memories of what these professional men and women witnessed, and their honest and clear testaments, were enough. Jane Sanger Norwich Trans debate: a third way? One thing that puzzles me is why there should be so much debate about sex and gender, with gender choice being equated with biological sex (“There’s no law says a charity can’t hold views you disagree with. Even on gender-identity issues”, Comment). In changing gender, a person has no experience of what it was like to grow up within that gender, ie the biological sex. Likewise, those who do not choose to change gender have no experience of the physical and emotional processes of transgender individuals. I wonder why that can’t be acknowledged and a third or fourth group be recognised? I appreciate that might raise practical difficulties, but it could shift the debate from its current binary and oppositional state. Dr Tania Phillips Porthleven, Helston, Cornwall Health partnerships vital In an Observer report using data published on Disclosure UK, the open transparency database provided by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), there are unjustified suggestions that industry partnerships with the NHS and with healthcare professionals may be detrimental to patient care. If this were true, it would be against the industry’s code of practice and the law (“How Big Pharma’s millions are influencing healthcare”, News). The report is right to highlight the acute challenges facing the NHS, with staff and resources hard-pressed to meet demand – which is why collaborations between the industry and NHS are more important than ever. All collaborations must improve patient care and outcomes as their primary objective. They allow companies and the NHS to pool skills, experience and resources to deliver projects that support the appropriate use of medicines in line with local or national guidance. These projects provide a triple win – benefiting patients, the NHS and pharmaceutical companies – which is vital as the NHS recovers from the Covid pandemic and seeks to pivot to a more preventative approach. Richard Torbett, chief executive, ABPI London SE1 Musical criticism is off key Further to your article (“Twelve culture secretaries in 13 years”, New Review), it is true that we have had no one in the post interested in or knowledgeable about the arts since Chris Smith. Sadly, Labour seems as uninterested as the Tories. For its spokesperson to say Nicholas Serota did a good job is hardly warm praise – he was director of the Tate, for heaven’s sake – but to claim that the classical music sector is at fault for not promoting itself is simply untrue. For example, the Manchester music ensemble Psappha – which Fiona Maddocks praised in your pages as “brilliant” – made programmes that could be accessed free online to help teachers teaching music to seven- to 11-year-olds, sponsored prizes and ran workshops so young composers could work with professionals. It has been doing this for 30 years. The outcome? The group lost all its Arts Council England funding. An invaluable community and artistic resource has disappeared.

Re your article “‘Reopen border to EU workers’ – top Tory Brexiter” (News): we must recognise that Brexit is here to stay; except we must find ways to reopen our borders with EU countries to cure our labour shortage; solve the Irish question; develop a coordinated policy to reduce inflation; foster collaboration with academic and research groups in the EU; allow medical services to be freely available when we travel; and allow the music industry unhindered access to the EU.

Micheál Martin’s remarks come amid claims the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) wants to delay a new Stormont assembly election as long as possible to give talks over the disputed Brexit protocol a chance to take off. The system, which imposes a mandatory coalition of representation from the two communities, was devised 24 years ago as part of the Good Friday agreement under which paramilitaries on both sides swapped the bullet for the ballot box. Recently, there have been complaints that it is out of step with the evolution of regional politics and does not give equal power to all parties. On Monday, the taoiseach said after more than two decades it may no longer reflect the needs of the community, as other parties – including the neutral Alliance party, now the third biggest in the country – have gained ground. “There’s a reason why all this [power sharing] came in, in the early years,” Martin said in an interview with the Financial Times. “There is room for the parties to look at changing the system. The system does polarise and it is not fit for purpose …  The electoral system should not be one that constantly reinforces polarisation.” The 1998 peace deal established a power-sharing system based on a consociational model of democracy designed by the political scientist Arend Lijphart for societies emerging from conflict. Under the rules, key decisions must have the backing of unionist and nationalist parties, with no explicit support required from an emerging third party. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, said earlier this year that the party’s emergence as one of the largest in Northern Ireland had raised questions over power-sharing structures. Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance party, welcomed the taoiseach’s remarks, tweeting that there should be an option for a “cross-community coalition for the willing”. Martin’s remarks come as Northern Ireland faces another hiatus in the power-sharing system owing to a boycott by the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) in a row over the Northern Ireland protocol. After the DUP failed to agree to return to the assembly’s executive by a deadline of last Friday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, announced there would be fresh elections. But he declined to name a date, fuelling speculation Rishi Sunak could yet sanction emergency legislation to delay an election. On Monday, the prime minister’s official spokesperson indicated there may not be any update this week. “I’m not aware of any plans for that [an update] during those visits. The rules are the date needs to be announced as soon as reasonably practicable. But I don’t have an update for you.” It is understood that the Northern Ireland Office is pushing for as early an election as possible but others in London think that a later election, possibly in January, could give talks over the protocol a better chance. None of the political parties support an election, fearing campaigning will do little to change the deadlock since the previous poll in May and will further polarise communities at a time of a national cost of living crisis. Heaton-Harris will be in Belfast on Tuesday to hold talks with Stormont party leaders and will meet the Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, later in the week. One source said the FCDO, which is leading on the talks with the EU over the protocol, was keen to delay the election as long as possible. Given the results could be similar to those in May, they say it would be unhelpful to have all sides dig in, further politicising the talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-12T17:25:34Z","webTitle":"Porter and Smith power England’s seven-try return to form against Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/nov/12/england-japan-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"Eddie Jones so nearly got his wish. For it was not until the late stages of this emphatic victory that a few Mexican waves began to ripple around the Twickenham stands. By that stage England had long since put a disappointing Japan side to the sword and demonstrated a dominance to both kickstart their autumn campaign and look forward to the sterner tests that await with relish. England were true to their word, slipped the straitjackets and played with more freedom of expression than six days previous against Argentina. Jones had promised that the focus in the buildup was all about this fixture rather than the World Cup – perhaps he is on to something – and a performance that would keep the Mexican waves at bay. That England almost achieved it aptly sums up their afternoon – not perfect, but significantly more polished. England set about their task with an intensity that Japan could not live with. They ran in seven tries, injected the pace that the selections of Jack van Poortvliet, Sam Simmonds and Jonny May suggested they would and ruled the skies to ensure Japan could feed off only scraps. They were far more disciplined, too, giving away just six penalties but the frustration is that it takes a defeat to bring about this sort of response from England and it must also be said that this is a fixture Jones’ side could never countenance losing, however much Japan have kicked on since they were last here four years ago. The All Blacks, due next Saturday, will be a different proposition, so too South Africa seven days later so call this a launchpad from which England head into those fixtures. As was the case when England last took to the field after a defeat, it was Ellis Genge who set the tone. He may have given a penalty away for being offside, overeager, but he won three at the scrum early on and where he leads, England follow. Japan could not escape the suffocating net that was England’s defence, there was a hurriedness rather than a fluidity to their handling, and Genge and co continued to turn the screw. Again England had plenty of the ball but this week there was more conviction to what they did with it. Van Poortvliet served Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell with quick ball and both were willing to use it rather than kick it away. England managed three first-half tries, the first a clever strike move finished by Freddie Steward. England’s maul was going sideways but Van Poortvliet sparked a move through the hands of Farrell and Smith and on to Steward, who evaded Kotaro Matsushima to dash over in the corner. Farrell added a penalty and in an illustration of England’s intent, he could be heard asking the referee Jamie Doleman if they could play advantage on the back of their scrum dominance. Steward then turned provider with a mazy run from deep before offloading to Van Poortvliet who fed Joe Cokanasiga, a late replacement for the injured Jack Nowell. He was shackled by Takuya Yamasawa but had the wherewithal to pop the ball up for Smith to score in the corner. Guy Porter added a third after Simmonds put his first England try on a plate just before the interval – the home side taking May’s yellow card in their stride. May had been sent to the sin-bin after a rare counterattack from Japan, led by Michael Leitch and continued by the impressive Dylan Riley with the England wing having to scramble – illegal in the eyes of Doleman. Japan opted to kick at goal, as they had done a few minutes earlier when well-placed, seemingly a tacit acknowledgement of England’s defensive might. Genge added the try his performance deserved soon after the restart by battering his way to the line after concerted England pressure and Porter had his second by showing a deceptive turn of pace to collect Farrell’s left-footed grubber with one-handed passes from the two locks, Jonny Hill and David Ribbans, in the buildup. Just as England were looking a touch too comfortable, Warner Dearns broke free from a ruck and teed up Naoto Saito for Japan’s only try before a flurry of replacements took the sting out of the match. A penalty try for England – for which Siosaia Fifita was sent to the sin-bin – and another for Smith put the gloss on the scoreline, Farrell adding the conversion to complete a flawless match from the tee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/22/brazil-bolsonaro-militants-lefist-lula-president","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T09:00:30Z","webTitle":"‘We will not surrender’: Bolsonaro militants demand coup as Lula prepares to take power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/22/brazil-bolsonaro-militants-lefist-lula-president","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/22/brazil-bolsonaro-militants-lefist-lula-president","fields":{"bodyText":"The “Soldier of the Homeland” and “the Patriot” loitered outside the jungle infantry brigade in this distant Amazon city, beseeching the troops inside to launch a military coup. “SOS armed forces! Save our nation!” said the Soldier, a brawny marine corps reservist who gave his nom de guerre for fear of being jailed. “We want the armed forces to establish law and order,” agreed the Patriot, a 30-year-old cosmetics saleswoman with similar anxieties about being identified. The pair have been camped outside the base in Boa Vista since 1 November, the day after their radical rightwing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, saw his hopes of a second presidential term dashed in Brazil’s election. Nearly two months later, with the leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva poised to take power, the pair are among thousands of citizens who continue to protest outside military installations across the country, demanding a coup that never comes. “If need be, we’ll stay here for 120 days – or a year. But we will not surrender our homeland,” insisted the Soldier, a 34-year-old former gold miner and marine. “We will not accept this guy as our president,” he said of Lula. “We will never accept this.” With just days until Lula’s inauguration, they would appear to have little choice. On the afternoon of 1 January, the leftist icon, who governed from 2003 to 2010, is due to be formally returned to the presidency at the age of 77. Vans have begun removing Bolsonaro’s belongings from the presidential residence after an anarchic four-year reign during which there were nearly 700,000 Covid deaths and a surge in Amazon destruction. Many progressives have poked fun at the Bolsonarista demos outside military barracks and regional commands, amid some bewildering displays of devotion to Brazil’s outgoing president. At one rally in south Brazil, pro-Bolsonaro militants were filmed singing Brazil’s national anthem to a tyre. Elsewhere, they have been filmed prostrating themselves in prayer or screaming wildly outside special operations bases and engineering units, in the hope of sparking an uprising. Footage of bizarre marching sessions has also been ridiculed on social media. But some experts caution against sneering at the protests, which, while small, suggest the radical grassroots movement energised by Bolsonaro’s presidency is likely to outlive his rule. “It’s cadre formation,” the Duke University Latin America expert John D French said of the pro-Bolsonaro vigils. “They are building a movement.” Consuelo Dieguez, a journalist who has written a book about Brazil’s burgeoning right, said she had initially been one of those giggling at the eccentric demonstrations of allegiance to Bolsonaro from predominantly elderly supporters. “At first I thought it was all rather funny. [I wondered] where have all these lunatics come from?” But as the weeks went by, and the protesters dug in, Dieguez’s amusement turned to distress. “I still think these people are bonkers but I no longer think it’s funny,” she said. Dieguez’s angst stemmed not from the scale of the mobilisations, which involve only a sliver of the 58 million voters who backed Bolsonaro’s failed campaign against Lula. “If all of Bolsonaro’s voters had hit the streets, goodness knows what might have happened to this country … there’d have been a rebellion,” she said. Nor did she see any risk of the military actually staging a pro-Bolsonaro coup d’état. “Bolsonaro’s finished. Everyone’s abandoning him,” she said. What disturbed Dieguez was the level of extremism on show at the rallies. “It’s almost an aberration that you have people in society thinking and acting in such a way. It’s shocking. How did society produce this? How can people be so dissatisfied they feel inclined to stand outside an army barracks asking for military dictatorship? What’s going on? … What happened to our society to produce such radicalised people?” she asked. The risks of such radicalisation exploded into view this month when hardcore Bolsonaristas rampaged through the capital, Brasília, burning buses and cars, in what some saw as an attempt to spark a 6 January-style insurrection. Security has been stepped up to shield Lula and his supporters from similar violence at his swearing-in ceremony. But the Soldier and the Patriot saw nothing radical or anti-democratic about their actions, and denied being “vandals” or “crooks”. “We’re family people … we all feel aggrieved and this is our cry for help so the armed forces come and intervene,” said the Soldier, urging a military junta to seize power to purge Brazilian politics of leftist kleptomaniacs. As the sun beat down on their roadside protest camp, they regurgitated a stream of falsehoods and insinuations about how Bolsonaro was robbed of re-election by fraud-riddled voting machines and tyrannical supreme court judges. “Bolsonaro was the real winner,” the Patriot declared. “We want either a new election or for President Bolsonaro to take charge,” said the Soldier, hailing a “historic” patriotic movement he claimed had attracted 10,000 locals to the gates of the jungle infantry brigade where he stood. On the afternoon the Guardian visited only about a dozen remained, sat on plastic garden chairs and in hammocks and surrounded by banners reading: “Brazil Was Stolen”, “Civil Resistance” and “We fervently want peace”. “It’s ridiculous,” said Dieguez. “But it’s worryingly ridiculous.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-522-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-30T11:53:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 522 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-522-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-522-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"President Vladimir Putin praised Russia’s navy in an address at the annual Navy Day parade. He announced 30 new ships this year as he said Russia was “building up the power” of its navy. Putin has said African and Chinese proposals could serve as a basis for finding peace but added elements were “difficult or impossible” to implement. He was speaking at a press conference after meeting African leaders in St Petersburg. A night-time drone attack on Moscow damaged two office blocks, the mayor of the Russian capital said early on Sunday, Russia’s state news agency Tass reported. The capital’s Vnukovo airport was temporarily shut. City mayor Sergei Sobyanin posted on Telegram that there were “no victims or injured”. However, Tass reported a security guard had been injured in the attacks. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has said Saturday’s Russian missile attacks killed one person and 10 were injured in Sumy. In Zaporizhzhia two people died and two were injured. Moscow said on Sunday its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to attack Russia-annexed Crimea with 25 drones overnight. The latest UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) update says satellite imagery captured on 19 July has identified approximately 300 tents and 200 vehicles in Tsel, Belarus, where Wagner troops have likely established a military camp there. The MoD said it was unclear what happened to the heavy equipment Wagner used in Ukraine, suggesting it was possible it was forced to return these to the Russian military. Pope Francis has called on Russia to revive the Black Sea grain deal, through which Moscow had allowed Ukraine to export grain from its seaports despite the war. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said Russia has lost 245,700 troops in Ukraine since the start of the war. According to the report, as of 9am (EET) on 30 July, Russia has also lost 4,205 tanks, 8,178 armoured fighting vehicles. Ukrainian soldiers fired UK-donated AS90 self-propelled artillery guns to mark the end of their training in south-west England. British army instructors taught the 72 Ukrainian army personnel how to operate and maintain the guns when in combat, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. The Associated Press has reported that Saudi Arabia will host a Ukrainian-organised peace summit in early August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Back online: the retired gas storage site now able to power 1m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"“Do you hear that?” asks Chris O’Shea, putting a finger in the air and looking out over a tangle of pipes and workers in orange hi-vis overalls. A deep whirr punctures the calm of the east Yorkshire coast, as a huge engine powers up and prepares to suck thousands of cubic metres of gas from deep beneath the North Sea. It is the first time that stored gas from Rough, a vast sandstone reservoir, has been pumped into the grid since 2017. Then, British Gas owner Centrica deemed its storage function “uneconomical”, and the government ignored calls to step in. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its throttling of Europe’s gas supply, has changed all that, and allowed the 37-year-old storage facility to make an unlikely comeback. “I promise this wasn’t staged,” says O’Shea, who is standing on a platform 100ft above the maze of metalwork that is the Easington gas terminal, which sucks the gas from Rough. It is six months since the then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng asked if Centrica could reopen Europe’s largest storage facility. The site, which has only been used to produce local gas for the last five years, is now 20% full, enough to heat about 1m homes. Its reopening means the UK now stores nine days’ worth of gas, up from six, but still the lowest in Europe. Rough has been called into action because of “Dunkelflaute” conditions blanketing northern Europe: barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days. These conditions have thwarted O’Shea’s efforts to fly by helicopter to the Rough platform, 18 miles offshore. He recounts trips offshore in early roles at the oil giant Shell,mistaking a tunafish for a shark on a rig trip in Nigeria. He is dressed in a trademark bright blue hoodie, with “join our Centrica pathway” on the front and “#netzerobattalion” on the back. Blink and you’d miss the millionaire executive with skin in the game of nearly every evolving energy story this week (see: costly bills, Sizewell C, Bulb’s takeover, windfall taxes, power cut frets). The reopening of Rough is a line in the sand for O’Shea, who has championed owning energy generation assets over simply being a retail supplier since taking charge in April 2020, reversing former boss Iain Conn’s strategy. The dash for gas after Russia’s invasion has raised questions as to why Britain has so little gas storage, and why ministers allowed Rough to halt its storage activities. Centrica had decided in 2017 that substantial investment was needed to make it safe at high pressures, with government support, to make it last a further 40 years. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” says O’Shea. “If we knew then what we know now, would it have been a different decision? Possibly.” Storage sites make money by taking in gas when prices are low, typically in the summer, and pumping it back out when prices are high. But the fall in gas prices in recent weeks has meant Centrica has been able to refill relatively cheaply. Investec analysts estimate reopening Rough could be worth as much as £5m a day. Rough sits below the resource-rich southern North Sea, where rigs routinely compete with windfarms and fishing boats for space. The sea is 36m deep, and Rough is 3km below that. A 30km-square sandstone reservoir, it is twice the size of Lake Windemere. It is connected to pipelines via 24 ever-narrowing straws. On the surface is a rig capable of housing more than 100 workers. Despite Britain’s drive to wean itself off fossil fuels, it is viewed as a giant insurance policy for the energy network. Executives argue its mere presence as part of the gas network “takes the froth” off prices. Centrica says it could have saved customers £2.4bn, or £88 each, last winter had it been active then. The FTSE 100 firm has funded this winter’s call to action, but O’Shea wants government support to secure its future. He estimates it would cost £150m to double its capacity to 60bn cubic feet by next winter. Longer-term, £1bn is needed to ramp up its methane capacity, and £2bn to fit the toughened steel needed for what Centrica hopes will be its next stage of life: the world’s largest hydrogen storage facility. The refit could take five to seven years if it is kept open during the work. “In order to invest, companies need to understand they can make a return and at the moment there is no confirmed model for hydrogen. We don’t need any government money and have never asked. We’re looking for the right regulatory framework,” he says. O’Shea hopes a “cap and floor” model guaranteeing revenues in tough times and returning windfall profits to taxpayers can be created for hydrogen. Is the current focus on gas obscuring the need to focus on green energy? “I think that long-term security of supply and decarbonisation can actually be complementary. They’re not mutually exclusive,” he says. He argues hydrogen is vital for decarbonising industrial Humberside and Teesside – the worst polluting areas of the UK and home to sites such as Scunthorpe steelworks. Entering Easington, it is easy to see the hallmarks of state ownership (British Gas was privatised under Margaret Thatcher in 1986). Over the fence lie the assets separated off in privatisation, now with fellow FTSE 100 company National Grid, that handle gas from Norway and the North Sea. On the wall, a projection shows the live status of each piece of machinery from the “pig tray” (a big bowling ball that squeezes liquid out of the pipeline) to the “slug catcher”, which helps further purify the methane. Ministers hope Rough’s extra supplies can complement other measures to reduce pressure on the energy supplies this winter – from putting coal plants on standby to National Grid incentivising firms and consumers to cut energy usage. The British Gas pilot of this scheme launches on Thursday. Called Peak Save, consumers with smart meters can receive about £4 for every unit of electricity they save compared with their normal usage. About 100,000 households are likely to participate and could save £100 between December and March, it estimates. “This approach to help manage residential electricity demand is likely to become a major feature of the market in years to come,” O’Shea says. The Scotsman neatly packs away his personalised overalls and tucks a can of Irn-Bru into his jeans pocket, before heading off to tackle whatever the energy crisis has to throw at him next."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-2023-day-2-aukus-unions-australian-labor-party-anthony-albanese-brisbane-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T06:36:34Z","webTitle":"ALP national conference day 2 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-2023-day-2-aukus-unions-australian-labor-party-anthony-albanese-brisbane-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/aug/18/alp-national-conference-2023-day-2-aukus-unions-australian-labor-party-anthony-albanese-brisbane-politics-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Thank you so much for joining us on day two of the 49th ALP conference. It can be dry at times and difficult to convey everything that is happening, but we truly appreciate your interest. We don’t take it for granted and it is heartening to see – spending some of your time and energy to engage with your democracy – even just checking up on what the governing party is doing/debating is incredible, given the everyday pressures and competition for your interest. So thank you. Major conference news will be carried in the Australia live blog tomorrow, with Politics Live going back on hiatus until parliament resumes on 4 September. I’m really looking forward to being back with you again, and our chats. But until then, check back on the site for all your political news, and take care of you. Today was a long day, so let’s review it in a quick bite-size piece for you. The party had its biggest barney over Aukus, but ultimately the political arm prevailed and explicit support for Aukus remains in the party platform. A 32-paragraph “statement in detail” has been added to the platform on Aukus, saying it will be carried out in line with “Labor values”. The Labor MP Josh Wilson openly dissented against supporting Aukus. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had to give a speech to the delegates on the issue. The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, was heckled by observers. A motion to reaffirm support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion passed – the party resolved to urge Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine and for Belarus to stop supporting Russia. Support for Iranians protesting against the brutal regime was also supported. It called on the government to continue to support Iranians through diplomatic pressure and sanctions. No resolutions or amendments hit the conference floor on the Israel-Palestine conflict but we heard a speech from each side. That means there has been no hardening of the Labor position on Israel’s actions. Some of the wording around supporting refugees was strengthened in the platform. Community support program places will be increased from 5,000 spots to 10,000. Labor also reaffirmed its commitment to sign and ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Labor recommitted to raising the aid budget to 0.5% of the country’s gross national income. Advocacy groups welcomed the change but say it’s still not enough (and short of the 0.7% called for). That’s it – day two is over and it looks like people can’t wait to get out of there quickly enough. It is a half day tomorrow, where there will be one more chapter, “bringing Australia together”, clean-up and a look at the ALP constitution, but that is pretty much it. There will be more protests planned tomorrow around conference, with progressive forces trying to convince the party to go further than what it has agreed to. I think we know that won’t be happening. Looks like day two is starting to draw to a close. That won’t be the end of it though – there is a whole other day to get through tomorrow. Zach Smith says the issue of engineered stone will be one of the most important decided by national conference, because it recognises workers’ rights to return home safely. “We have to stop this killer stone,” he said. The amendment states: Labor will take all necessary steps to eradicate the hazard posed to workers by exposure to silica dust. Labor recognises that the elimination of silicosis requires the strong coordinated efforts of all governments to take all necessary measures, including a ban on the manufacture, use and import of harmful engineered stone products, as well as other preventative measures, including: regulation outlining minimum safety benchmarks for application across all industries where workers are exposed to respirable crystalline silica dust (including mandatory silica awareness training for workers in those industries), comprehensive health monitoring program during and after employment to assist in identifying the onset of any dust-related disease, dust register for all diagnosed cases of occupational lung disease, and support (ﬁnancial and psychological) for workers (and their families) diagnosed with occupational lung disease and who are struggling to return to work and adjusting to life with the devastating impact of their lung disease. Labor will ensure that workers who suffer an illness or disease as result of exposure to silica will have the same access to justice and rights as workers exposed to asbestos. The construction union’s Rita Mallia has moved an amendment specifying that superannuation is included in the fair entitlement guarantee for unpaid wages when employers are bankrupt or insolvent. Super was included in the 2021 platform, but was not included in a draft for this year’s platform. That has been rectified. The Community and Public Sector Union’s Melissa Donnelly has brought a whole crew of people on stage wearing shirts for the union’s campaign to bring back the Commonwealth Employment Service. “Privatised employment services do not work,” Donnelly says. The current system is achieving its goal – not because it’s finding jobseekers’ meaningful jobs, but because it is making private providers a profit. Donnelly says the amendment is a step towards bringing back the CES. It says: “Labor believes that the employment services system must support Australians to access quality job opportunities, address structural barriers to employment including skills, training and entrenched disadvantage, and assist employers to plan for and meet their labour and skill needs. Labor recognises that the current system does not adequately meet these goals, and Labor is therefore committed to reforming the system, including through: an enhanced role for the public sector in coordination and service delivery, including assessment, digital services, case management, research and quality assurance: and assisting local community specialist not-for-profit entities to contribute to the Commonwealth system.” Senator Tony Sheldon is speaking about the gig economy, arguing that customers have a “perverse incentive” to complain about workers delivering their food to get their meal free. Gig workers earn “as little as $6 an hour” and can wake up to find their job has been “deactivated”. Sheldon criticises the Coalition for saying it is “too complicated” to regulate the gig economy, arguing the conservatives are in favour of “sweatshops on wheels”. He says: “Let’s make sure those Liberal National low-pay mongrels are held to account as well.” The construction union is moving amendments improving unions’ right of entry, promising to remove “barriers to union officials speaking to and representing workers in the workplace”. ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, says this chapter of Labor’s platform delivers on its purpose of a “fair go for working people”. McManus says that a record profit season “during a cost of living crisis” is the “starkest illustration of what is going wrong”, with workers falling behind while some chief executives “pop champagne corks”. McManus praises Labor for “not wasting any time” in legislating to improve workers’ rights. “Working people have waited a long time for these loopholes to be closed,” she says. She says: “The sooner these laws are enacted the better. They will help Australians dealing with a cost of living crisis, and they will save lives.” The industrial relations minister, Tony Burke, tells the conference that Labor has been able to change workers’ lives through legal changes since its election. Burke praises the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, and president, Michele O’Neil. Burke is rattling off Labor’s greatest hits including a submission on the minimum wage, 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave, and abolishing what he labelled anti-union bodies, the Registered Organisations Commission and Australian Building and Construction Commission. The secure jobs, better pay bill also banned pay secrecy, advertising a job for less than the legal rate, and ended “zombie” agreements with lower pay and conditions. Burke says in coming weeks the government will take greater action to fight silicosis and loopholes in IR law, including “inappropriate” use of labour hire. He says: “When parliament resumes I’ll be introducing legislation to close loopholes. It should not be the case that wage theft evades criminal law. If it’s illegal to steal from the till, it must be illegal to steal from the worker as well.” The skills and training minister, Brendan O’Connor, says unions were removed from consultation on training for nine years of the Coalition government. O’Connor says Jobs and Skills Australia is a “tripartite body” with 10 councils made up of employers and unions, to give “real economy insight into what is needed in our economy, today and tomorrow”. The 180,000 fee-free Tafe places promised at the jobs and skills summit have been filled, and Labor has added another 300,000 places next year. Tony Piccolo, from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, is moving an amendment on indexation of Help debts. Piccolo says the minister’s office told him ending indexation could cost $4bn to $9bn. He argues if “we can afford stage 3 tax cuts, we shouldn’t be putting a further burden” on students, making it harder for them to enter the housing market. Labor MP Carina Garland says the cost of degrees has gone up 140% since her time at university. The amendment passes. It reads: “Labor believes the Hecs-Help system should be fair and sustainable and focus on making university more accessible and affordable for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Labor will work to ensure that studying at university does not shackle young workers with a lifetime of debt.” The Labor conference has amdended its platform to specify: “Public schools are among our nation’s most important institutions and should be fully and fairly funded to deliver excellent secular education that meets the needs of every child.” Early childhood education minister Anne Aly is the second speaker to open the chapter. Aly says “no child born into any form of disadvantage should have to carry that disadvantage through their life”. The Cowan MP says she herself is an example of that: Opening the doors of opportunity is about inclusion and about fairness, delivering a fair playing field for all Australians and their families. And that, my friends, is the power of education. I know this to be true from my own story. Education allowed me to rise out of poverty, to develop my own career in advocacy policy, academia, and now here in politics. Conference is back. Education minister Jason Clare is opening chapter 2 on education, titled “Opening the doors of opportunity”. We’re expecting another relatively uncontroversial section, with the first hour to cover off amendments to the policy platform on early education, schools, civics classes, university funding and apprenticeships. Clare says: We have great teachers and great educators in this country, but we need more of them. And we’ve got a good education system, but it can be a lot better and a lot fairer. Early childhood education minister Anne Aly will be up next. Greens leader Adam Bandt has some thoughts about what the Labor conference has produced so far: The national conference has confirmed Labor is a centre-right party and the Greens are Australia’s only social democratic alternative. The prime minister is asking for decades in power, presumably so that after tax cuts for the wealthy, nuclear submarines and new coal and gas mines, Labor can implement more Coalition policies. With Labor locking in support for stage 3 tax cuts for the wealthy and nuclear-powered submarines, the Greens are now the only party opposed to war and neoliberalism. It is incredible that even when the so-called left has the numbers, the party still backs unfair stage 3 tax cuts and the logging of native forests while opposing a tycoon tax on corporate super profits. Instead of de-escalating tensions between the US and China, Labor’s Aukus pact risks dragging us into the next US war. The Greens will continue to fight this dangerous and expensive deal that undermines the peace and security for our country. The conference was meant to have started the last session of the day by now, but it is running a little behind. The last session went over, but given what happened on the floor, there is probably a little bit of heat behind the scenes which is being vented. The voice has been mentioned by almost every Labor MP in introducing their section of the platform at the ALP conference, including Anthony Albanese, but it hasn’t played a huge role in the proceedings. Albanese was asked on Sky News earlier today what would happen if the referendum failed, given polling keeps pointing down: You have to respect the outcome. I’ll still support constitutional recognition, of course. But there won’t be another vote next week or next year. I still will do whatever I can to assist closing the gap. But what we know is it will be harder because a voice will make it easier. There’ll be a structured body, advisory body, to government to make it easier. The ALP national conference isn’t the only show in Brisbane (Brisbae, Brissie, Bris Vegas etc) with the rally for native forests arriving on Saturday. That will be adjacent to the conference, with the Bob Brown-led rally occurring at the nearby Musgrave Park. Labor didn’t vote to include an end to native forest logging in the platform, instead agreeing to review the 1992 forestry agreement. Brown said the tide was turning against native forest logging: Now is the time for all good people to come to the defence of the rainforests and wildlife. This is part of the global rainforest end years. Either we make a stand in wealthy Australia to stop this completely unwarranted and needless destruction or the game is up for the world’s future environmental security. We cannot ask people elsewhere to do what we aren’t prepared to do ourselves. The conference is now on a break for lunch. The next chapter – “opening the doors for opportunity”– is not expected to be as fractious. After that uncomfortableness (you can bet there will be a few fiery words off the conference floor as well, but that usually happens behind closed doors) there is an attempt to return to a warmer vibe, so awards are being given. Kimberley Kitching has had an award named after her – the human rights award honouring her work in getting Magnitsky-style legislation passed in Australia. (The laws essentially provide a legal basis for sanctioning foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world.) Tony Clark, Delegate Clark from the Victorian branch has been given the award for his “extensive advocacy work within our party, he’s also worked for accessibility and inclusion across the education and employment sectors.” So a bit of technical whoosh whoosh here – but president Wayne Swan ruled that the second anti-Aukus motion had lapsed, as it had been dealt with in the debate. So no vote. The chapter is now closed – Labor is a little bruised, but the political arm got what it wanted – the platform still contains explicit support for Aukus. That doesn’t mean the dissenters will drop it, just that the fight will continue on another day. Paul says there was still dissent from the section of the floor which didn’t give Anthony Albanese a standing ovation, with a shout for “no” as they went through the motion, but no vote was called. The ayes had it, meaning the motion passed without a vote and the other amendments lapsed. (Meaning the political party got its way) Returning with a little more from Anthony Albanese’s address to the conference: These are the choices of a mature nation, a nation that understands that a bright future calls for more than sunny optimism, that strategic complexity that we face is far removed from the bleak certainties of the cold war. We have to analyse the world as it is rather than as we would want it to be. We have to bring our defence capabilities up to speed and Aukus is central to that ... Aukus takes away nothing from what we do. What it does do though, it is an enhancement, an act of clear eyed pragmatism that works in our national interest. And in the context of greater good. He went on to the jobs impact of Aukus, getting a big clap for the promise of 20,000 “well-paid union jobs”. Prior to Albanese arriving, Michael Wright from the Electrical Trades Union – who as a reminder is against Aukus – was given a chance to respond to some of the slights against him by defence industry minister Pat Conroy. Earlier, Conroy said those against the Aukus deal would have been on the side of Liberal prime minister Robert Menzies, instead of Labor prime minister John Curtin. Wright responded: I cannot let slide, I cannot let go, an inference or accusation that the resolution that I move is in some ways akin to Menzies, in some ways akin to Neville Chamberlain. These sorts of ad hominem sloganeering attacks do nothing to elevate the debate, do nothing to deliver us close to resolution. Anthony Albanese was not scheduled to speak in the debate, so it is notable that he has chosen to make an intervention here. Again, there are not the numbers to remove support for Aukus from the platform, but there is enough to make things uncomfortable in the room. And with a sitting Labor MP expressing some concerns, it prompted a bigger response. Albanese continued: Now delegates, a partnership with two of Australia’s oldest friends through Aukus and an enhancement of the alliance that is the heart of one of the three pillars of our foreign policy is consistent with the Labor values that I have been a part of my whole life. US alliance, regional engagement, support for multi-lateralism as we invest in, capitalise through Aukus, we will be guided by the recommendations of the defence strategic review, to ensure that we have the assets that we need where we need them. And that includes conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines, submarines that are harder to detect and can travel further. If you come to the position, as I have, that Australia as an island continent needs submarines, then it is compulsory. If you’re serious about national security then analyse what is the best form of submarines for us to have. And I have come to the position, based upon advice and analysis, that nuclear powered submarines are what Australia needs in the future. Submarines’ importance in our defence capability as an island continent will grow over time. Anthony Albanese has addressed the room: Investing in our capability and investing in our relationships add deterrence to our diplomacy, and [we are] bringing both to our presence in this region, engaging with our Pacific family with respect, reinvesting in development assistance, working with our neighbours and partners to promote peace, security, stability and prosperity right across the Indo-Pacific. Acknowledging the centrality of Asean to our north and supporting Ukraine in the face of the illegal and immoral invasion by Russia. We know there is no security in isolation. Australia has a role and indeed a responsibility to engage in our region and the wider world. Delegates, to fulfil these objectives, to sustain and strengthen Australia’s place in the world, our government is investing in our capabilities and we are investing in those relationships. After that, Anthony Albanese has entered the debate to a round of applause from the majority of the delegates part of the room. Josh Wilson: In my view, the decision to acquire nuclear propelled submarines is not justified and involves too many risks to the maintenance of our future submarine capability, to the proper balance of our defence budget allocations and to our sovereign manufacturing capacity. In addition, it involves the sharing of weapons-grade nuclear technology in a novel arrangement that carries non-proliferation and safeguard integrity risks, disturbs the regional status quo and commits Australia to take on decommissioning and nuclear waste storage challenges that have not been met by anyone, anywhere. These are matters of legitimate concern in parts of the Australian community, including among Labor members and branches and within the Labor movement. Labor MP Josh Wilson has openly dissented from the Albanese government position on Aukus, rejecting defence industry minister Pat Conroy’s argument that opposing Aukus is appeasement as “ridiculous”. Wilson said: We must continue to bring that kind of searching and sometimes difficult debate to these matters, which more than some other topics, frankly, require greater scrutiny rather than less and should never ever be advanced on the basis that they are the decision-making preserve of some defence and security establishment. As it has been rightly been said, and as we should always remember: to a person with a hammer every problem looks like a nail. Deterrence is a valid strategic concept and submarines certainly have a deterrent value. But deterrence is not a one-word justification for any and every defence acquisition. And anyone who thinks the intention to extend the scope of one’s threat capacity only serves to reduce the potential for conflict has not looked very closely at the history of conflict. And with the greatest respect to delegate Conroy, the suggestion that anyone who questions a particular defence and security decision or acquisition in the name of strength is ridiculous. The rowdiness continued as Pat Conroy said: So delegates, if you’re pro human rights, you need to be pro Aukus. If you’re pro peace, you need to be pro Aukus. If you are pro advanced manufacturing, you need to be pro Aukus, if you’re pro trying to bring manufacturing back to this country, you need to be pro Aukus, this is in the national interest, and it’s in Labor’s interests, and I commend the delegation to the floor. The delegate section is now trying to show its support –there is a large round of applause from the floor (where the delegates sit) for Pat Conroy after he says “strength deters war”. Conroy says: that arms race has already started”. Prompting interjections from the observers section: “So don’t join it” Things are getting rowdy now. There is a big clap for Michael Wright from the observers’ section, but it’s echoed only in part of the delegates section. [Defence industry minister] Pat Conroy is speaking - there are interjections of “rubbish” when he says Aukus is vital for national security and “don’t lead us into war”. Richard Marles’s speech probably enlivened the crowd more than anything else during the conference. The defence minister called the Aukus deal a “clear choice”. Delegates once again, in a difficult moment, Australians are looking to us. Now I know that the word nuclear invokes a strong reaction, but we are not about nuclear weapons. Indeed, under this arrangement, Australia will remain and fulfil all our obligations under the nuclear proliferation treaty and we will be working with the International Energy Atomic Agency to do that, and we will meet our obligations under the Treaty of Rarotonga because we will never base nuclear weapons on our shores. But we are talking about nuclear propulsion and, without it, we will not have in 2040 the same submarine capability that Paul Keating gave us in the year 2000. And if we take submarines off the table, we will never have left our country more exposed and that will undermine the whole idea of Australian self-reliance, which is at the heart of our platform. Delegates, this is a hard choice but it is actually a clear choice. There are cries of “no” from the observers section of the conference hall as ETU national secretary Michael Wright asks rhetorical questions: “is this the best way of securing a national interest?” and “is this the best way to spend $368bn”. This is the section of conference that ALP members who are not delegates can attend. There was a standing ovation after Richard Marles’s speech, but it also sounds as though there were some not-as-positive responses. There is still a contingent of left-affiliated Labor members who are not happy with the Aukus pact, or of Labor’s support for it. Not enough to shift the vote, but enough to make things a little uncomfortable. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has described the Aukus deal as “a modest step” after outlining how China will have 200 nuclear-powered submarines by the end of the decade. Australia will never have a million-person army. We are a comparatively small defence force. So, in that context, our submarines are easily the most important platform that we operate because of what a single Collins-class submarine can do and the uncertainty of where it might be at any given moment, it provides a genuine question mark in any adversary’s mind. It provides pause for thought but, in the future, diesel electric submarines will become increasingly detectable and so if we want to have this capability in the future, then we simply have to take the step of nuclear propulsion. The Aukus debate has begun. Right on time. Wayne Swan is running a tight ship today. Back in the conference room and maritime union official Paddy Crumlin has just spoken on an amendment about media diversity by unloading on News Corp. Crumlin said that democracy is supported by a “media that wants to tell the truth” but warned that in Australia “we haven’t got that” because its biggest media empire is known “for fake news, vilification, opposing every decent piece of legislation”, including labour rights and the Indigenous voice. Crumlin called for a review of the media, suggesting this would expose the “projectile vomiting of ideology” seen on Sky News, which he likened to Fox. When I’m asked how do I measure success, being a trade unionist, the number of negative editorials I get in the Australian ... They vilify the working men and women of our union, as if we’re some kind of visceral threat. Crumlin also had a sledge at Peter Costello for “running second” to John Howard, and Nine Newspapers for “running second in the ideological stakes with Murdoch”. He said: If we don’t do something about it, we’re not going to achieve all the wonderful things that Albo said. Truth. Representation. Diversity. Being able to provide for everybody. They don’t want that for starters. They want us to go away and leave it for them. They’re going to oppose the Labor party regardless of our policies. They’ll oppose trade unions regardless of our courage. Crumlin concluded by suggesting that media stories should contain an authorisation – “authorised by the Liberal party and One Nation – and every other undemocratic force in this country”. In her interview, Laura Tingle quoted a Labor delegate who was speaking on housing and said “when we’re in a hole so deep, we need something bigger and bolder”. There is frustration the government is not going far enough to address the housing crisis. There are more people living in tents or in their cars. Families are just one unforeseen financial issue away from insecure housing. The interest rate mortgage “cliff” is hitting and people are having to find a couple of extra grand a month to keep up. So does Anthony Albanese think the Labor government is doing enough? He said: What I’ve been doing is working with state and territory leaders across the political spectrum who all understand that we need to do more. We need to do more to build, supply is the key, in order to assist by home ownership purchasing, but also in order to assist renters. And the proposals that we announced yesterday, of a housing accord now envisaging 1.2m additional homes being built by the end of the decade, as well as our renters’ rights prescriptions that have been agreed to by state and territory governments. Our plan that we announced today, the shared equity scheme by state and territory governments giving up their rights, if you like, or approving the commonwealth having such a scheme, which was necessary, will make a difference as well. Right across the board we are delivering on housing. And it’s the most comprehensive housing strategy that we’ve seen for a generation. And it comes after 10 years of neglect from the former government, who for a long time didn’t even have a housing minister. In case you missed it, Anthony Albanese was on ABC’s 7.30 last night, where he was asked what was the message of this conference – was Labor being ambitious enough? Albanese: The message of the conference is that we’re working for Australia, that what we’ve done is implement almost every one of the policies that we took to the election, perhaps with the exception of the Housing Australia Future Fund stuck in the Senate. We’re a government of purpose, that we’re a government that is building a strong economy, in order to lift living standards. We’re dealing with cost-of-living pressures without putting pressure on inflation. We have addressed the challenge of climate change by taking it seriously and by looking after our environment. And we have a significant social policy agenda, one of the measures of which is putting women and gender equality at the centre of our economic strategy. The opposition has zeroed in on the “union jobs” line Labor figures have been promising when it comes to Aukus. Jason Clare was asked about that on the Seven Network this morning: Aukus is important. It’s important to make sure that we can defend our country in the years ahead, but it’s also going to create thousands of jobs and create new businesses. Some of those will be union jobs, some of them won’t be. The Liberal deputy leader, Sussan Ley, had thoughts on that: Why don’t the best people get the jobs? That’s what Aussies, as Jason would say, are used to experiencing in their workplace, not a workplace distorted and dominated by unions. I’ve got a broader message to Australians who are watching this morning. Labor has spent three days at this annual conference talking about themselves. They’ve talked about us, they haven’t talked about you, they haven’t talked about you, the ordinary Australians who are struggling, struggling to rent, struggling to buy a home, struggling to pay your mortgage, because, as usual, it’s about the politics of negativity and it’s about the politics of always pointing at your opponents. So, I’m glad Jason’s supporting Aukus. I’m glad the Labor party has supported it. I know many in the Labor movement do not. And I know that there’s considerable angst at this Labor conference because of that and because this is where the faceless men and women of the Labor party gather and factional politics determine public policy. To which Clare responded: More Liberal rubbish. We’re the only party that has a conference where the media are allowed in and can see everything. The Liberal party do this behind closed doors. Sussan talks about negativity. The Liberal party say ‘no’ more than my six-year-old does. You can’t come on Sunrise and talk about negativity, Sussan, when you say no to cheaper medicine, you say no to cheaper electricity, you vote no to everything that the Labor party does. The United Services Union’s Graeme Kelly and the Australian Local Government Association president, Linda Scott, are moving an amendment to improve the rights of local government. The motion says that Labor will: Increase funding for essential council services, operations and personnel, including through fair funding increases to the ongoing Financial Assistance Grants Increase funding for local government maintained roads and participate in a range of programs to provide funding to local government Ensure local government has a voice in key policy matters, including through meaningful participation in national cabinet and relevant ministerial committees Support engagement between local, state and territory governments and work with local government to improve its capacity for innovation, productivity, efficiency and capability This is significant because Anthony Albanese said local government would be added to national cabinet but instead they’re only invited to one meeting a year. Let’s take a quick breather here and take stock of that first hour. Labor is working at a relentless pace to pass all these motions and that’s on top of the fact that all of them have already been pre-agreed. So, to get you up to speed, here are the main points: A motion to reaffirm support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion. The party resolved to urge Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine and for Belarus to stop supporting Russia. Support for Iranians protesting against the brutal regime was also supported. It called on the government to continue to support Iranians through diplomatic pressure and sanctions. No resolutions or amendments hit the conference floor on the Israel-Palestine conflict but we heard a speech from each side. Some of the wording around supporting refugees was strengthened in the platform. Community Support Program places will be increased from 5,000 spots to 10,000. Labor also reaffirmed its commitment to sign and ratify the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. As Guardian Australia revealed earlier in August, the Northern Territory attorney general, Chansey Paech, and the construction union secretary, Zach Smith, are moving two amendments to improve territory rights, including boosting their Senate representation. The amendments state that Labor: Respects the right of self-governing territories to make their own laws, in their own interests, free from interference by the federal government. Labor will follow a policy of non-intervention in decision-making of the self-governing territories and will oppose any interventions by other political parties Will review our current system of electoral representation, noting Australia’s growing and increasingly diverse population, the increasing demands on elected representatives and our commitment to integrity and transparency. Labor will address the historic proportional under-representation of the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory and commits to increasing its representation in the Senate. Paech said: Don’t talk about us – give us a bigger voice in the Australian parliament by increasing the representation of the Northern Territory and ACT. Expanding territory representation in the Senate is supported by the ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, who has suggested four senators for each territory. It could help the ACT senator David Pocock boost independent representation in the Senate. Pocock has advocated for four or six senators for the territories. There have been those reminders scattered all through the conference – that Labor has its debates in the open. Which is not entirely true – there is plenty that happens behind closed doors too. But you usually know what issues are being debated behind those closed doors because they started in the open. This conference is not going to see a radical reset of Labor’s platform. But it does show you some of the tensions within the party (which exist in every political party) and how the political arm plans on dealing with it. Here is a little bit more from what Mark Dreyfus had to say when introducing this most recent chapter: Labor knows – in opposition and in government – that Australia’s strong democratic traditions are precious and must be protected. But that does not mean complacency, or a lack of appetite for reform. … When the Labor party talks about keeping Australia’s democracy strong, the greatest example is right here, in this hall. Unlike every other party, we are not scared of robust debate and disagreement – in a very public forum. We think direct input from our party members is a good thing. It doesn’t just keep Australia’s democracy strong, it keeps the Labor party strong. And it keeps us focused on our most important task – working for all Australians. Kirk McKenzie, a Sydney-based lawyer, is speaking on the whistleblower amendment, criticising the “disgraceful” treatment of Bernard Collaery by the Morrison government. There’s also an amendment that puts the principles of a fair trial into Labor’s platform: People accused of a criminal offence are not compelled to incriminate themselves People are not subject to prolonged detention without charge Persons charged with a criminal offence are presumed innocent until proved guilty before an independent court Charged persons are tried without undue delay Accused persons are given a fair trial People charged with serious criminal offences are provided with legal representation if they are unable to afford legal representation of their own People shall not be found guilty of any crime, the elements of which did not constitute a crime at the time of its commission People convicted of a criminal offence shall have the right to appeal against conviction and sentence Evidence obtained illegally, by torture, coercive techniques or by improper investigative practice is inadmissible Civil and criminal trials should take place before independent courts open to the public, with suppression and non-publication orders only to be made in exceptional circumstances The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephens-Smith, is moving a batch of amendments to the democracy chapter. The most interesting is the commitment: To improve whistleblower protections for the public sector and improve consistency with the private sector by considering an independent whistleblower protection authority to protect whistleblowers, to advise and investigate in relation to whistleblower matters and to review legislation that affects whistleblowers. Dreyfus rejected crossbench calls for a whistleblower protection authority in the first tranche of updates to the Public Interest Disclosure Act – but it’s an idea that won’t go away. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, is introducing the chapter Strengthening Australian Democracy. He spoke about the importance of an Indigenous voice in the constitution and thanked delegates who had fought for a National Anti-Corruption Commission, which is now legislated. Dreyfus said Labor is not afraid of open debate at its national conference: It doesn’t just keep democracy strong, it keeps the Australian Labor party strong. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, is seconding the chapter. She notes that at the 2022 election voters indicated they wanted to “restore trust and integrity” in government. Rowland said it was important to safeguard public broadcasters from “political attacks” as they had been under the Coalition. Apologies for the whiplash but Western Australian MP Josh Wilson has just spoken about amendments to the party’s platform on signing and ratifying the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. Wilson said: In the first quarter of the 21st century, the risk of nuclear war has increased but the overlapping set of agreements that exist to govern and reduce the possession of nuclear weapons has weakened against that depressing trend. Signing the treaty has been in the platform since 2018 but the difference now is Labor is in government. The wording is changed to make it a bit stronger but there’s still no timeline on when it will actually be signed. This is what Wilson said: They also make it clear that Labor in government will seek to contribute to addressing the matters that will enable Australia, ultimately, to sign and ratify the treaty and for the first time, they commit Labor to looking at further environmental remediation and victim assistance in relation to the nuclear testing that occurred in Australia. Just on that last post, the shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, has also provided an example on that. He was asked about the Aukus debate on Sky News and said: The divisions we’re seeing within the Labor party over Aukus are a reminder that Labor could never have initiated the Aukus pact; that the Labor party clearly has such deep divisions here the only way they came to be able to support it in government was because a Coalition government had initiated it, and Labor adopting a strategy of being a small target at the last election, simply quickly folded in and supported what the Coalition had initiated. But now we’re seeing these remarkable scenes and of course so much of it happening in even more bitter division behind the scenes of Labor promising the 10,000 jobs will apparently all be union jobs – I don’t know whether they’re going to force people to join the union or what the terms and conditions of that will be; that we’ve got 32 paragraphs of attachments being put on to the national platform to try to appease different factions within the Labor party here and to deal with the factions. And it’s a reminder that in the lead-up to this conference, we had Labor changing Australia’s position in relation to key issues around Israel; we had Labor junking plans for the low-level radioactive disposal facility; you’ve seen many different bones thrown to the leftwing factions of the Labor party to try to achieve unity and yet still they’ve got division and still apparently they’re even going to delay further the discussions that may occur at the national conference today. For those watching along and wondering what is happening and why Labor is not shooting for the moon here, given the left have the numbers on the floor and Labor is in government, it’s because when Labor is in government, its conference always tends to be more muted. Fights on the floor can have consequences that don’t apply in opposition. While the platform doesn’t have the power it once did, it can still be used for political means by Labor’s opponents. And because not a huge number of people know the difference between Labor’s conference platform and the agenda the political arm carries out (which is also true for the Liberals and Greens, but neither party is as open as Labor about its conference) when it comes to Labor being in government, the conference is dulled. We’re on the final few motions now before we zip to the next chapter on strengthening Australian democracy. The next group of amendments are loosely based on improving the rights of refugees in Australia. One of the amendments, for example, seeks to include this paragraph in the policy platform: Labor believes that refugees need safety and security. Labor will work cooperatively with the international community to find durable solutions to the global refugee crisis and will deploy our statecraft to advance the cause for peace and human security. It also looks to add: Give the highest priority to the humane, durable and timely resettlement of refugees subject to third country resettlement agreements. Susan Templeman is speaking on the issue. She outlines her experiences visiting Palestine, seeing the beautifully manicured lawns of Israeli settlements and ornamental lakes. Then she talks about the stark contrast Palestinians face, such as being denied building permits and access to roads leading to agricultural lands, facing erratic water supply and the demolition of their homes. I’ve spent time with both Israelis and Palestinians who want to see human rights, democracy and equality for all. That’s why I speak in favour of the words in our Labor platform, which are about supporting the recognition of the right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within their own secure and recognised orders and for the call our platform makes for the recognition of Palestine as an issue of priority by our government. We all know, every one of us knows, that by choosing to have a role in contributing to peace in this region, we make a choice that involves serious, thoughtful, respectful but difficult conversations. Since we’ve come to government, those conversations have started. There’s technically no resolution here but it’s combined in a group of amendments, including the reunification of Ireland and the importance of nuclear disarmament. The block of amendments is carried. Former trade union official Michael Easson is now up. We’ve whizzed through this morning so quickly, it’s 30 minutes earlier than expected. Easson, who is in the pro-Israel camp, seems somewhat confused he is speaking before Susan Templeman, who is in the pro-Palestine camp. The original order placed Templeman first, followed by Easson. Wayne Swan waves it on, saying: “I’m not going to rearrange a delegate.” Easson starts off: I want to say that there can be no peace without justice. But equally there can be no justice without truth and the central and tragic truth of the Israel-Palestine conflict is that two people, the Jewish people and the Palestinian, have deep centuries-long historical ties to a territory, no larger than half of Tasmania. Both people want their political independence and to live in peace and freedom. It would be contrary to the great spirit of equal justice, on which the Labor party operate, to affirm a collective right of self-determination for either people while denying it to the other. While we are looking at Aukus and defence, Daniel Hurst has looked into a report examining Australia’s proposed missile program, and well – it is not great: Australia’s push to develop and deploy its own missiles lacks credibility as a means to deter conflict unless backed up by US support, a new paper warns. The report, published by the Australian Army Research Centre, points to the Australian government’s desire to increase the country’s “self-reliance”. But the paper argues Australian long-range strike capabilities have limited benefit as a tool to deter an aggressor, because they merely impose cost without changing the outcome of a conflict. The paper examines “forward presence” – the concept of placing armed forces in locations outside a country’s main territory in support of national interests. As mentioned, the party president is on a mission to keep things on schedule today. Next up is a push for reaffirming the party’s commitment to supporting those in Iran from the brutal regime. Tina Hosseini, from the Iranian Women’s Association, is speaking. The motion, among other things: Calls on the Australian government to advocate for the human rights of the Iranian people and to continue to take deliberate and strategic action, including through diplomatic pressure and sanctions, to hold Iran to account for its actions. Swan tells the speaker to wind up a few times. Other speakers, MP Peter Khalil and senator Raff Ciccone, waive their right to speak. The motion is carried. We’re heading straight into the motions and resolutions now. If you thought yesterday’s pace was speedy, today is going to be even speedier. The national president, Wayne Swan, has already flagged there’s a lot to get through and has put delegates taking their time to get to the stage on notice. A motion to back Ukraine and condemn Russia is now on the floor. It calls on “Russia to immediately withdraw from Ukraine and for Belarus to stop supporting Russia’s autocratic senseless war”. Lawrence Ben from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association said: It might not be on the front page of the paper every day but we must continue to stand with Ukraine. Their fight is our fight. They are on the frontline fighting for freedom and democracy in Ukraine, but freedom and democracy everywhere. And it sends a message in our region and we must continue to stand with them. Even if it doesn’t stay on the front page of the paper every day. The motion is carried. Earlier this morning, Richard Marles did his regular segment with the Nine network, where he and Peter Dutton “debate” the week’s issues. Which included the Labor conference position on Aukus and the “statement in detail”. Marles: Firstly, these were announcements that we made back in March. In fact, what this is going to do is create 20,000 jobs around the country, direct jobs around the country, a point that we made back in March, because this is going to be one of the great industrial endeavours of our country, to have us constructing nuclear-powered submarines in Australia. And there will be jobs in South Australia. There’ll be jobs in Western Australia as well. But we’re going to be reliant on a supply chain which actually goes into the industrial base of the whole country, into places like Queensland, NSW, Victoria. So, these are points that we made back in March. But we’re not afraid of a difficult debate. That’s what happens at Labor party conferences and we let the country see that. That’s very different to how both the Greens and the Liberals operate. But I very much know how important this is for our nation. We need to have this military capability in an uncertain world if we want to be able to have submarines as a capability going forward. We simply have to take the step towards nuclear propulsion. And my experience is that when you’re talking about difficult debates – be it immigration, border protection, national security – what we do here is have considered debates and we make hard decisions. And I’m sure that’s what the conference will do today. Richard Marles now has the podium. He also points to the invasion of Ukraine as a reminder of why the Labor government is trying to get the “hard power equation” right. When Russian tanks rolled across the Ukrainian border last February, everyone expected that the conflict would last weeks, if not days. No one imagined that 18 months later Ukraine would be standing defiant and proud. That the war in Ukraine has defied all predictions tells us that our world and indeed our region is uncertain, but that we do have agency. It tells us that we live in serious times requiring serious people and that the narrow-minded, gratuitous way in which the former Liberal government was running defence and foreign policy is hopelessly inadequate for the times that we now face. It tells us about the importance of getting the hard power equation right, which is what this government is doing in its response to the defence strategic review because increased military capability gives us greater self-reliance and a self-reliant Australia is what is at the heart of the chapter that we now submit to you. Penny Wong continues, mentioning the other elephant in the room – Aukus. It’s expected we’ll get some robust debate later on from midday. By having strong defence capabilities of our own and by working with partners, investing in their capabilities, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor. That is why we are committed to Aukus and that is why we are redoubling our efforts towards a world without nuclear weapons, continuing Labor’s proud tradition in nonproliferation and disarmament. Penny Wong is opening the morning’s chapter. She starts off by reminding attendees of the challenges the world is facing, including “Russia’s illegal and immoral full scale invasion of Ukraine”. It then turns to the elephant in the room – China. But friends, challenges to sovereignty are not limited to full-scale invasion. Closer to home, we see encroachments on the ability of countries to make their own decisions. Encroachments, including unsustainable lending and coercive trade measures, political interference and disinformation, encroachments on the ability of countries to contribute to a regional balance. If any one country believes they can dominate another, the risk of conflict increases and we must ensure that no state ever concludes that the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks. Up first today is chapter seven, Australia’s place in a changing world, which covers the party’s defence, security and foreign policy. For viewers back home, this will cover off some contentious issues, such as Aukus and Labor’s recent policy shift on Palestine. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, and the defence minister, Richard Marles, will open the chapter and the first hour of discussions will centre on aid and the Indo-Pacific. Then we’ll dive into two speeches on the Palestine-Israel issue – one from Macquarie MP Susan Templeman and the other from trade unionist Michael Easson. There will be no motions or amendments to the policy platform and it’s expected both speeches will be relatively uncontroversial after last-minute interventions. Mixing things up, the conference will then go straight to chapter six, strengthening Australian democracy. Aukus debates will be postponed until after chapter six, so expect that to happen around midday. But Labor Against War supporters have vowed to continue the fight. Former senator Doug Cameron is one of the founding patrons of the group: Paul Karp looked into what is about to happen in the Aukus debate: The Albanese government will stare down union and grassroots Labor dissent against the Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition, offering reassurances about nonproliferation and waste but rejecting hostile motions at the party’s national conference. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, and the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, will move a 32-paragraph statement arguing the submarines are important to deter “aggression” and committing to deliver “well-paid union jobs”. Labor will allow a debate on Friday morning on a motion that would remove a positive mention of Aukus from the party’s platform, ventilating the issue in a form unlikely to embarrass the government. Opponents of Aukus concede the push will not be successful. Earlier this month, the federal government announced it was hardening its stance on “illegal” Israeli settlements and would refer to the West Bank and Gaza strip as “occupied Palestinian territories”. While it was met with some criticism from the pro-Israel camps across the political aisle, it’s also coming from within the party. At a side event hosted by the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network (Apan) last night, Tasmanian senator Anne Urquhart acknowledged the party had “a long way to go” given the many pro-Israel caucus members. We have a long way to go in terms of being able to have a frank discussion about trying to make sure that we get this done. So I just want to – I can’t walk out of this room tonight without saying that we have hurdles to overcome in our caucus. Among the panel’s attendees were West Australian senator Fatima Payman and MPs Susan Templeman and Alicia Payne. West Australian senator Louise Pratt, who had recently returned from an Apan-funded trip to Palestine, said she held confidence in the foreign minister, Penny Wong, along with the party, that Palestine would eventually be recognised as a state. Of course, it will provoke a reaction that then has to be managed so I’m presuming that we are just moving cautiously. I’m very cognisant that in considering the electoral politics of this and considering the international ramifications of this, that we can move forward and recognise the state of Palestine. The first chapter up for debate is officially called “Australia’s place in a changing world”, which is just a fancy way of saying defence and foreign affairs. This has been where the defence minister, Richard Marles, the minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, and the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, have spent most of their time. You’ll find aid, Aukus, defence and Palestine in this chapter. At some point over the next two days, the final part of the economic chapter has to be passed, but that isn’t a priority at this point. Welcome to day two of the Labor national conference. Aukus is first up and while Richard Marles and co have managed to quell any dissent that would have removed support for Aukus from the party platform, simmering tensions remain. It wouldn’t be a Labor conference WITHOUT simmering tensions, but it’s a continuation of Anthony Albanese’s long-term goal – keep the party in the centre, show that it’s better than the Coalition at managing the economy and defence, and then hopefully become the “natural party of government”. Or at the very least, three terms. We’ll cover the ins and outs of the day for you, so check back to see how it’s all going. It all officially kicks off at 10am."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-03T14:00:46Z","webTitle":"Midwinter magic: Robert Macfarlane on the enduring power of The Dark Is Rising","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/dec/03/midwinter-magic-robert-macfarlane-world-service-the-dark-is-rising-susan-cooper-bbc","fields":{"bodyText":"I first read Susan Cooper’s The Dark Is Rising the summer I turned 13, the year the Berlin Wall came down. I read it by torchlight under the bedclothes, not because of parental curfew or power cut, but because that seemed the safest place to read what was, unmistakably, the eeriest novel I’d ever met. Eeriness is different in kind to horror. Eeriness thrives in edge-of-the-eye glimpses; horror is full-frontal. The eerie lives in the same family of feelings as Freud’s “uncanny”, which in its original German, unheimlich, means “unhomely”. A core power of Cooper’s novel lies in its counterpointing of the homely and the unhomely. It opens in the domestic clamour of the Stanton family house, in a quiet English village in the upper Thames valley. It’s 20 December: the eve of both the winter solstice and the 11th birthday of Will, the youngest of the Stanton children. Inside the house, all is pre-Christmas chaos, baking smells and familiarity. But in the wintry landscape around, something is very wrong. Rooks are behaving strangely, dogs are suddenly afraid of Will, a blizzard is coming, and “a shadowy awareness of evil” is building. Will’s life is about to change for ever – for he will become caught up in an ancient battle between the forces of the Light and those of the Dark, which are always strongest at midwinter. His young shoulders are soon to bear an immense burden. The Dark Is Rising sank deep into my bones. Its characters – tall Merriman, capable of such warmth and such wrath; the Lady with her leitmotif of haunting, ethereal music; wise young Will; horned Herne – leapt into my imagination, and have never left. I was also deeply influenced by Cooper’s sense of landscape as a memory-shaping, time-slipping medium, present more widely in the tradition of Anglo-American fantasy fiction that runs from John Masefield’s The Box of Delights, through Alan Garner, Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea books, Cooper herself and on to Robert Holdstock and Philip Pullman. Places, in the work of all these writers, carry auras and memories; they act both archivally and prophetically. Landscape is a palimpsest upon which ancient stories are both contested and renewed. Such ideas were powerfully formative for me as a writer, and Cooper’s presence is particularly strong in a book I wrote about walking, paths and history called The Old Ways (there’s a significant “Old Way Lane” in The Dark Is Rising). I know of many other writers and artists, among them Katherine Rundell and Helen Macdonald, for whom Cooper’s work has also been influential. For Max Porter, the series “did more for my imagination, for my vocabulary, for any curiosity or concern I had for Englishness, for history, for listening, than anything I learned at school”; it gave him and his brother “a mythology that we could see and feel around us in rural England, and on our windswept holiday weeks in Snowdonia”. Millions of other readers have met Cooper’s work and never forgotten it. Five years ago, with the poet Julia Bird, I co-ran a midwinter Dark Is Rising reading group on Twitter. Thousands of people joined from dozens of countries. #TheDarkIsReading trended nationally on Twitter, and the online outpouring of affection for the book was immense. This winter, I hope The Dark Is Rising will find new audiences around the world. For, working with the actor, director and theatre-maker Simon McBurney, and supported by Complicité (the theatre company that Simon co-founded) I’ve spent the past year adapting The Dark Is Rising as an audio drama. It will be broadcast first on BBC World Service in 12 episodes, beginning on 20 December, with an episode following each day, such that the broadcasts correspond to the “real time” of the novel’s own unfolding across the solstice, Christmas and New Year’s Eve. I gave a copy of The Dark Is Rising to Simon back in 2017, when I realised he’d never heard of it. Simon read it aloud to his son, Teyo. Then he read it aloud to Teyo for a second time. Then he and Complicité developed the idea of adapting it, and I jumped at their invitation of involvement. It made immediate sense to me to translate The Dark Is Rising into sound. For this is a novel, far more than most, to which one listens with the mind’s ear as well as seeing in the mind’s eye. Its soundscape is deeply complex; brimful of noises, melodies, songs and chants. Speaking aloud is crucial within it: words hold force when given voice – you must watch what you say. It’s long been a puzzle to me that there aren’t more adaptations of Cooper’s novels (the book we’ve adapted is the second in a five-novel series, usually referred to as the Dark Is Rising sequence). There was an American film “version” in 2007, so appalling that I and all true Cooper fans refuse to speak its name. A radio adaptation for BBC Children’s Radio 4, 25 years ago. Other than that, nothing I knew of. Early in the process of adaptation, in discussion with Complicité’s brilliant producer Tim Bell, Simon and I resolved on four creative principles. First, that we would honour Cooper’s novel and its 50-year-long power of enchantment. Second, that we’d make something far more ambitious than “just” an abridged reading of the book; third, that the supernatural elements of the production would be recorded binaurally, to immerse the listener acoustically; and fourth, that we’d draw out the transnational nature of Cooper’s vision. For the “Old Ones” – the warriors of the Light – are drawn from every country and background, and it is a Jamaican Old One who gives to Will an object of immense power, without which his quest cannot be completed. It feels right to us that this adaptation will be broadcast on the World Service, and heard in nearly 90 countries. Working with Simon on the adaptation was inspirational; a 12-month masterclass in the skills of narrative pacing, dramatic tempo and creative perfectionism. As well as co-adapting the text with me, Simon also directed the performances and voiced the narrator. Complicité slowly gathered a superb cast including Toby Jones, Harriet Walter, Miles Yekinni as Herne, Natasha K Stone as the “devil-girl” Maggie Barnes, and 13-year-old Noah Alexander, who plays young Will Stanton. Though it’s structured around a Manichean opposition of Light and Dark, Cooper’s novel refuses to cleave into neat binaries. I think of it, in fact, as a cold war novel, first published in 1973 and kindred in its moral complexities to early Le Carré; describing a conflict fought in the shadows, in which no one is clean. At its heart is the relationship between the central Old One, Merriman (played by Paul Rhys in our adaptation), and his “liege man” Hawkin (played by Toby Jones). Merriman must have a splinter of ice in his heart to do what he does to Hawkin. “This is a cold battle we are in,” Merriman tells Will, chillingly, “and we must sometimes do cold things.” At the novel’s core is a hard question: when the dark comes rising, who will turn it back? Susan Cooper was born in Buckinghamshire in 1935. When I met her in the US, she told me how, when the air raid siren sounded during the blitz, her mother would hurry her and her brother down into a nearby bomb shelter. There, by candlelight, she would tell stories to the children to take their minds off the danger. What Cooper recalled – a detail that lifted the hairs on the back of my neck as she told me – was that when the bombs fell, their detonations would cause the candle flame to quiver. The nearer the explosion, the more the flame shook. Boom… shiver…Boom… shiver…Boom! Shiver! People have been telling stories to one another around fires of one kind and another for thousands of years. Cooper learned the power of storytelling in the air raid shelter as bombs fell around her. I first read her books by torchlight, and they helped me cope with the anxiety I felt then at the possibility of nuclear conflict. Now new-old fears – climate chaos, war, ecological collapse – menace our minds. The dark is always rising, and it is the work of the greatest stories to hold it back. The 12-part BBC audio adaption of The Dark Is Rising, commissioned by the World Service, will be broadcast on the World Service from 20 December, and on Radio 4 from 26 December"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-14T16:52:26Z","webTitle":"The power of collective grief in this time of change | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/14/the-power-of-collective-grief-in-this-time-of-change","fields":{"bodyText":"Marina Hyde highlights the unpredictability of mass grief and how those at the centre of power can be unnerved by spontaneous public emotions (Britain could plan for the Queen’s death – but not for the risky tides of public feeling, 9 September). This observation is fair enough in so far as it goes. But we need to look into the nature of the events that inspire such emotions, rather than at the emotions themselves. The Queen’s death marks a transition between two stable states: that of her own long reign and that of the reign of her son, Charles, that has now begun. Events over the past few days are designed to create stability in an otherwise unstable liminal phase that will last until King Charles’s coronation. The rituals that we have been witnessing are designed to avoid the potential disruption that all such rites of passage make possible (hence the repetition of words such as tradition and history). The royal family is acutely aware of the potential threat to its hitherto accepted right to reign over the UK and various Commonwealth countries. Like all liminal personae, its members behave in a passive or humble manner, obeying their unseen instructors’ commands. They must be seen to be doing the right thing. It is in such moments that “communitas” (Hyde’s “mass anything”) is often born – witness one woman giving the new king a kiss in front of Buckingham Palace. But communitas can also emerge as an opposing force (the response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, for example). This is what those in power are afraid of and do their utmost to prevent. Prof Brian Moeran Moretonhampstead, Devon • Marina Hyde is wrong to say that “politicians and many of our institutions are most frightened of the public having emotions”. Has she never been to a party conference or heard a stump speech? At its worst, politics is the pushing of different emotional buttons, found in slogans such as “take back control” and “global Britain”, referencing our (glorious) imperial past. Slogans work because they carry an emotional punch. When exchanging them becomes all that there is, without the backing of policies and real content, then it’s no wonder, as she writes, that 61% of 18- to 34-year-olds consider parliamentary elections to be a bother. The feelings most people are experiencing over the death of a widely respected 96-year-old lady who died peacefully in her favourite place are natural – linked, as all mourning is, to our own mortality. Harold Mozley York • The outburst of mourning after the Queen’s death is precisely the kind of emotion that those in authority would prefer: distracted and entirely passive. The emotion of protest challenges the power of the ruling class. It is an emotion that must be stifled, as the recent police and crime bill showed. The focus on mourning keeps the emotion focused in a way that precludes any challenge to authority. Robert Beavis Bristol • I normally laugh aloud at Marina Hyde’s writing, but her column left me with genuine fear. If the poll she quotes is remotely accurate, and around two-thirds of young people of voting age believe that we need a strong leader unfettered by parliament, then democracy in the UK is certainly in for a hard time. Another unwelcome legacy of the past three years. Alan Whitehouse Barnsley, South Yorkshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Government data released last week shows that the four councils with the largest number of families where at least one child does not receive financial support due to the cap – Birmingham, Manchester, Bradford and Leeds – are Labour-controlled. Sheffield and Tower Hamlets, which are fifth and eighth in the list of local authorities worst hit by the policy, were under Labour control until 2021. Keir Starmer’s decision not to scrap the policy if Labour wins power has led to attacks from anti-poverty campaigners and disquiet from senior figures in the party. A number of senior Labour figures who represent some of the areas worst hit by the policy have spoken out against the leadership’s stance. Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, told LBC radio that Starmer should promise that “when there is the headroom to do something, this clearly should be at the front of the queue”. In the Greater Manchester combined authority area, 23,750 families are affected by the cap. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, told the Daily Record: “We will continue to press any incoming UK Labour government to move as fast as they can within our fiscal rules to remove this heinous policy.” In Scotland 24,160 families are affected by the cap, including 3,990 households in Glasgow city, which is under no overall control. It is the seventh worst-hit council in the UK. Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow in east London, argued that scrapping the cap could save money as it was “potentially costing more than it is saving” as greater hardship prevented people from finding work. A total of 2,100 families in Waltham Forest, where Creasy’s seat lies, are affected by the cap. In London 62,190 families are affected by the cap. Support for Labour in the capital has generally been strong but a closer than expected mayoral race in 2021 and a mixed set of results in the city’s 2022 local elections, with the party gaining control of three councils but also losing three to break even, has frayed its stronghold status. In Camden, where Keir Starmer’s constituency is situated, 1,120 families are affected by the cap. In some parts of the country where Labour has recently lost electoral ground, the two-child limit has also had a big impact. The West Midlands metropolitan borough of Sandwell has the ninth-highest number of families affected by the cap in the UK, with 3,900 affected. In 2019, Labour lost two of the area’s four seats to the Conservatives. In Kirklees, where Labour also lost two of the area’s four seats to the Tories in 2019, 3,760 families are affected. Both Sandwell and Kirklees councils are still under Labour control. On Tuesday Starmer doubled down on his decision not to scrap the two-child benefit cap, saying Labour had to make “really ruthless” decisions before the next general election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/11/us-government-biden-carbon-capture","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-11T16:27:48Z","webTitle":"Experts fear US carbon capture plan is ‘fig leaf’ to protect fossil fuel industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/11/us-government-biden-carbon-capture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/11/us-government-biden-carbon-capture","fields":{"bodyText":"The US energy department has announced it is awarding up to $1.2bn to two projects to directly remove carbon dioxide from the air, a fledgling technology that some climate experts worry will distract and undermine efforts to phase out fossil fuels. The process, known as direct air capture, does not yet exist on a meaningful scale, and the move was being seen as the US government taking a big bet coming after July was confirmed as the hottest month ever recorded on Earth. Countries are not cutting planet-heating emissions enough to avoid disastrous global warming of 2C, or more, above pre-industrial times. This shortfall means that planting forests and developing machines that can suck carbon directly from the air will be required to remove billions of tons of greenhouse gases, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). But Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, recently warned that carbon capture was “no free lunch” and that countries should be wary. The most recent IPCC report was published in March and warned it was “now or never” to take action on emissions with the world on the brink of irrevocable damage. Reacting to the news of the US investments by the Biden administration on Friday, some experts were worried the technology was being used as a “fig leaf” by the fossil fuel industry. The projects selected for energy department backing are Project Cypress, which will be built in Calcasieu parish, Louisiana, and the South Texas DAC Hub, which is planned for Kleberg county, Texas. Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary, talked up the potential of the technology in a press conference call. “If we deploy this at scale, this technology can help us make serious headway toward our net-zero emissions goals while we are still focused on deploying more clean energy at the same time,” she said. Shannon Boettcher, professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon, said direct air capture technologies are not yet cost effective, but are worth some investment in research and development. Claire Nelson, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory said moving away from fossil fuels and producing the things we need without emissions are the most important ways to address the climate crisis. But the scale of change needed makes direct air capture necessary as another tool. “In order to have direct air capture ready at the scale we need it by 2050, we need to invest in it today,” she said. However other experts said the investments were a mistake. “This money could be so much better spent on actual climate solutions that would be cutting emissions from the get go,” said Jonathan Foley, executive director of Project Drawdown, a group that publicizes climate solutions. He cited energy efficiency and lowering emissions from agriculture, transportation, electricity generation as better approaches. “What worries me and a lot of other climate scientists is that it potentially creates a fig leaf for the fossil fuel industry … the idea that we can keep burning stuff and remove it later,” Foley added. The Biden administration delivered a historic climate bill last August though the president’s record on the climate has been undercut by his aggressive giveaway of oil and gas drilling leases on public land, including the controversial Willow oil project in Alaska."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T12:55:20Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear team in Zaporizhzhia limbo as Russia narrows access to plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/un-nuclear-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-plant-inspection","fields":{"bodyText":"Uncertainty hangs over the planned visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant by a team from the UN nuclear watchdog, as inspectors arrived in Ukrainian-controlled Zaporizhzhia city on Wednesday, where they are likely to spend the night before crossing the frontline. The International Atomic Energy Agency mission into Russian-controlled territory, which comprises representatives from countries deemed neutral by both sides, was reportedly intended to last four days. But on Wednesday, the Russian-occupying authorities said the IAEA would be given access for one day. They also said the mission would be expected to join the queue of civilians who cross back and forth between territory controlled by Ukraine and Russia. If that happens, it could delay or disrupt the visit. These potential obstacles come in addition to safety concerns. Ukraine and Russia have given their security guarantees for the mission to travel to the plant and the neighbouring areas, Rafael Grossi, the head of the agency, said before leaving Kyiv. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, Oleh Nikolenko, wrote on Facebook that Russia must not obstruct the mission’s work at the plant. The facility and the surrounding towns continue to come under shelling. Last week, fighting in and around Europe’s largest nuclear plant damaged vital electricity supplies prompting global concern. Grossi described the mission as “very complex” “We are going to a war zone,” he said. “We are going to occupied territory. And this requires explicit guarantees from not only from the Russians but also from the Republic of Ukraine.” Upon arriving in Zaporizhzhia, Grossi said he and his team were there to conduct a “technical mission” to prevent a nuclear accident. The city council building in the plant’s satellite town of Enerhodar was shelled overnight, according to its mayor-in-exile, Dmytro Orlov. On Monday, the plant, Enerhodar and the nearby Ukrainian-controlled town of Nikopol came under heavy shelling. Grossi said he hoped to establish a permanent mission in Ukraine to monitor the plant. Russia’s representative to the IAEA, Mikhail Ulyanov, said Russia would welcome the establishment of a permanent mission on Wednesday. Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, said it was important for the mission to speak to the plant’s staff and “get the real information, not Russian information”, on what was going on inside the facility. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the mission would spend four days at the plant. But on Wednesday, Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed Zaporizhzhia administration, a Russian-appointed official, was quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax as saying the delegates would be given only one day at the facility. Adding to the suspense, a member of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia administration said the mission would not be given priority and would have to wait in a queue to cross the frontline into the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia province. “The IAEA mission will stand in line to get to the liberated part of the Zaporizhzhia region. This is due to the fact that they will not be issued special passes,” Volodymyr Rogov wrote on Telegram. He wrote that the IAEA could access the plant more easily if they came through Russia. The Zaporizhzhia plant, captured by Russian troops in March but run by Ukrainian staff, is located in a hotspot of a conflict that has settled into a war of attrition fought mainly in eastern and southern Ukraine six months after Russia launched its invasion. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant. Ukraine claims the attacks are false-flag operations carried out by Russia to damage the image of the Ukrainian army; Russia says the attacks are being conducted by Ukraine. The world was on edge last week when fighting cut off electricity supplies to the plant, disconnecting it from the grid for the first time. The plant needs electricity for its cooling rods and security systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster”. A backup electricity supply line kicked in and the plant escaped dangerous overheating. Russia has been poised to hold referendums in the occupied Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions for several months, but battles and attacks continue in the area. Ukrainian forces frequently attack deep inside the occupied territories using western-supplied long-range rockets, and Russian-appointed officials have been targeted in a string of assassinations. Ukraine says it is now conducting offensives with the aim of recapturing the neighbouring Kherson region, which was occupied by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. Ukraine’s military have not released details or evidence of the alleged offensive. Citing Ukrainian and western sources, the Financial Times reported at least part of the aim was to scare Russian troops into fleeing as Ukraine was short of artillery required for a ground offensive. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, the deputy head of Kherson’s regional council, told Ukrainian TV the offensive had been successful in three places in the districts of Kherson, Beryslav, and Kakhovka but declined to give further details. Meanwhile, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s offensive had failed along the Mykolaiv-Kriviy Rih frontline. Russia says it shot down three Ukrainian helicopters and that Ukraine had lost four fighter jets during the fighting. Russia is using the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as a military base. Ukraine, the US and the UN have called for the facility to be demilitarised. Russia said there were no “ongoing discussions” about demilitarisation, Russia’s Tass news agency reported, citing the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said Kyiv was seeking international assistance to try to demilitarise the area. “We think the mission should be a very important step to return the plant to Ukrainian government control by the end of the year,” he told the Associated Press. “We have information that they are now trying to hide their military presence, so they should check all of this.” The European Union’s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, told the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform he hoped the mission would be successful. Speaking at an informal meeting of the EU’s foreign ministers, Borrell criticised Russia for “playing games” with nuclear security and called for the plant to be demilitarised. The US has called for the plant to be shut down. “We continue to believe that a controlled shutdown of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactors would be the safest and least risky option in the near-term,” said the White House national security council spokesperson, John Kirby.

Sullivan said that the Russian leader had been “waving around the nuclear card at various points through this conflict”, and it was a matter that Biden’s administration has “to take deadly seriously because it is a matter of paramount seriousness – the possible use of nuclear weapons for the first time since the second world war”. In a separate interview with CBS, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he was not certain that Putin was bluffing with nuclear threats. “Maybe yesterday it was bluff. Now, it could be a reality,” he said. “He wants to scare the whole world.” The administration’s security chief said that Russia’s nuclear threat against Ukraine, including extending its nuclear umbrella over eastern parts of the country that are still being contested seven months after its invasion, would not deflect the US and its allies. “We will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its country and defend its democracy,” Sullivan said, pointing to more than $15bn in weapons, including air defense systems, hundreds of artillery pieces and rounds of artillery, that the US has supplied to Ukraine. He said that Moscow’s mobilization of troops and “sham referenda in the occupied regions” would not deter the US. “What Putin has done is not exactly a sign of strength or confidence – frankly, it’s a sign that they’re struggling badly on the Russian side,” Sullivan said. But, Sullivan added, it is “too soon to make comprehensive predictions” about a collapse of Russian forces. “I think what we are seeing are signs of unbelievable struggle among the Russians – you’ve got low morale, where the soldiers don’t want to fight. And who can blame them because they want no part of Putin’s war of conquest in their neighboring country?” Sullivan continued: “Russia is struggling, but Russia still remains a dangerous foe, and capable of great brutality.” He alluded to mass burial sites containing hundreds of graves that Ukrainian forces found after recapturing Izium from Russia and said, “We continue to take that threat seriously.” He added that the US, the International Atomic Agency and Ukraine nuclear regulators were working together to ensure there is no “meltdown” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in eastern Ukraine. The Russians, he said, had been “consistently implying that there may be some kind of accident at this plant”. Reactors at the plant, Sullivan said, had been put into “cold storage” to “try to make sure there is no threat posed by a melt-down or something else at the plant. But it’s something we all have to keep a close eye on.” Separately, Sullivan said US criticism of a crackdown on mounting protests in Iran after the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini would not affect the administration’s offer to lift sanctions on Iran as part of the effort to reach a deal on nuclear enrichment. “The fact that we are in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program is in no way impacting our willingness and our vehemence in speaking out about what has been happening on the streets of Iran,” he said. Last week, Biden told the general assembly of the United Nations in New York that “we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights”. The US president’s remarks came shortly after a defiant speech by Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi. In his remarks on Sunday, Sullivan said the US had taken “tangible steps” to sanction the morality police who caused the death of Mahsa Amini. “We’ve taken steps to make it easier for Iranians to be able to get access to the internet and communications technologies to talk to one another and talk to the world and we will do all that we can to support the brave people, the brave women, of Iran,” Sullivan said. But Sullivan refused to be drawn out on whether the US would change its policy on lifting sanctions in exchange for a nuclear deal in light of the protests. “We’re talking about diplomacy to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon,” he said. “If we … succeed … the world, America and its allies will be safer.” But the pursuit of a nuclear deal, Sullivan said, “would not stop us in any way from pushing back and speaking out on Iran’s brutal repression of its citizens and its women. We can and will do both.” • This article was amended on 27 September 2022 because Jake Sullivan referred to Russia’s mobilization of troops and the “sham referenda in the occupied regions”, not that the mobilization of troops “was a ‘sham referenda … ’” as an earlier version said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T06:15:21Z","webTitle":"SA premier says buying nuclear submarines directly from US would degrade Australian shipbuilding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/25/sa-premier-says-buying-nuclear-submarines-directly-from-us-would-degrade-australian-shipbuilding","fields":{"bodyText":"The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has criticised a proposal for Australia to buy nuclear submarines directly from the US, saying it would “not be acceptable” for his state to miss out on promised submarine manufacturing jobs. A report in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday suggested the Biden administration was considering a plan with the UK and Australia to fast-track nuclear-powered submarines for Australia by the mid-2030s by producing the first few submarines in the US. However, given existing production constraints at US shipyards, the deal would depend on Australia making a financial commitment to expand the US’s submarine-production capacity to ensure it could also meet its domestic demands. Malinauskas told Guardian Australia that while he understood the geopolitical need for the Australian government to expedite the process, Australian workers needed to be involved in any arrangement that included the new subs being manufactured in the US. “Clearly a South Australian workforce needs to acquire the skills to be able to build nuclear submarines and it makes sense that those skills are acquired working with the overseas partner that is already doing so,” he said. “We accept that the commonwealth has a substantial challenge, and is responding to what is widely accepted as the most unstable geopolitical climate the nation has found itself in for some time. We accept that is a risk that’s worthy of being addressed, but a degradation of our sovereign shipbuilding capacity is inconsistent with addressing that risk.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked if it would be acceptable for the Australian government to purchase submarines from the US without training an Australian workforce as part of the deal, Malinuaskas was clear. “No, that would not be acceptable from the state government’s perspective, because that would represent a degradation of what has been promised, and that is that these subs are being built in Australia,” he said. “It all depends on the pathway, and that detail really matters here – not just for the economic interests of the state, but also from our sovereign submarine-building capacity, which is such a central tenet of de-risking Australia’s security position.” How Australia intends to fill the capability gap between its existing Collins Class fleet and the new fleet of up to 12 nuclear-powered submarines is the subject of a federal government review that is due to report by March next year. On Sunday the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the review, being undertaken by former defence minister Stephen Smith and former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston, would consider how best to fill the capability gap that would otherwise see Australia wait until the mid-2040s for new submarines. “What we’ve sought from the process that’s under way with Aukus right now is not simply to answer the question as to what platform we run with – although that’s clearly critical – but how soon we can get it,” Marles told Sky News. “To the extent that there is any capability gap, if we can bring the start date forward, what is the solution to plugging that? We obviously need to have a sense of cost, and we need to make sure that what we are doing is completely compliant with our non-proliferation obligations. And we’re confident that the body of work that’s under way now will be able to answer all those questions in the first part of next year.” Marcus Hellyer, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that he had little sympathy for the view of the South Australian government, and the pendulum was swinging away from the defence budget being used as “a job subsidy scheme”. “We need to have a very clear-eyed discussion about these issues and not simply say, ‘building, assembling them here is a fantastic thing, that will be wonderful’,” Hellyer said. “It will cost more, it will take longer, you probably won’t have the industrial benefits that people say, and it will potentially have huge opportunity cost in terms of the human resources that we could be applying to sustaining the submarines.” “We shouldn’t default to immediately building all boats here regardless of the cost and the schedule impacts of doing that.” In a joint statement released last week to mark one year of the Aukus pact, the leaders of Australia, the UK and the US said that the group had made significant progress towards Australia acquiring conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. “We are steadfast in our commitment to Australia acquiring this capability at the earliest possible date,” the statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/aug/02/drax-denies-use-of-subsidy-loophole-to-avoid-639m-payout-to-households","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-02T13:07:20Z","webTitle":"Drax denies use of subsidy loophole to avoid £639m payout to households","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/02/drax-denies-use-of-subsidy-loophole-to-avoid-639m-payout-to-households","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/aug/02/drax-denies-use-of-subsidy-loophole-to-avoid-639m-payout-to-households","fields":{"bodyText":"The owner of the Drax power plant has been forced to deny that it used a loophole in the government’s subsidy scheme to avoid paying almost £650m to households since the start of the energy crisis. An investigation by Bloomberg found that the FTSE 100 company idled one of the generating units at its giant North Yorkshire power plant for much of 2022 when the energy market crisis plunged millions of homes into fuel poverty. The report claims that if Drax had kept running the unit, which earns a fixed subsidy levied on energy bills, it would have been required to return an estimated £639m to bill payers as of last month. Instead the FTSE 100 company was able to use a surge in the global price for wood pellets to make more money from selling them on than it could by using them to generate electricity, according to Bloomberg. Although Drax is not alleged to have broken any market rules, a previous energy minister accused the company of acting against the national interest. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, who was energy secretary when the government negotiated the subsidy deal, said: “It looks like they are acting in bad faith.” Under the terms of the subsidy contract, which has handed Drax about £1.4bn to date, energy projects receive a fixed price for each megawatt of electricity generated. Usually companies receive a payment levied on energy bills which tops up the earnings from the wholesale market to the agreed “strike price”. But in the past year market prices have been significantly higher than the subsidy level, requiring companies to pay the difference back to consumers. Drax has denied that it intentionally shut its biomass unit to avoid making these payments in favour of profiting from the resale price of its wood pellets, branding Bloomberg’s investigation “false, inaccurate, and misleading”. The company said the surging price of biomass had made the generating unit “uneconomical” to run at the agreed subsidy level, which assumed the average cost of biomass would be about $181 a tonne. In 2022 the price reached a peak of $467 a tonne. A Drax spokesperson said: “The Russians’ invasion [of Ukraine] created unprecedented challenges to the electricity market due to constrained fuel supplies, leading to an increase in both the demand for biomass and the price of pellets. “Given this, we had to make responsible decisions on our winter hedging to minimise risk to Britain’s energy security and our business … No serious observer of the energy system would advocate that we ought to have exposed Britain’s power grid and our business to increased risks.” A government spokesperson said the subsidy scheme had been “hugely successful” in securing more than 26GW of new low-carbon electricity capacity since it began in 2014. They added that generation decisions are “a matter for private energy companies” and would take account of wider market conditions."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/16/time-for-your-medicine-unlocking-the-power-of-our-body-clocks","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-16T11:00:33Z","webTitle":"Time for your medicine: unlocking the power of our body clocks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/16/time-for-your-medicine-unlocking-the-power-of-our-body-clocks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/oct/16/time-for-your-medicine-unlocking-the-power-of-our-body-clocks","fields":{"bodyText":"Your doctor tells you how many times a day you should take a pill, and whether to take it with or without food – but they very rarely tell you the exact time at which it has to be taken. Chronopharmacology (also known as chronotherapy or circadian medicine) – the idea that a pill popped at exactly the right time has maximum benefit – could be a major influence on the future of medicine. Increasing studies are showing that what time of day we treat disease can be crucial, and that it’s possible to pinpoint the time of day when certain disease is at its worst. In 1997, doctors in Denver split 59 asthmatics into three groups. The first group used steroid inhalers at 8am every day for four weeks. The second used the same inhalers, but much later in the day, at 5.30pm. The third group dosed four times a day at 7am, 12 noon, 7pm and 10pm – at the time, this was believed to be the optimal regime. After a month, the results were in. The 8am group saw the least improvement, while an inhaler at 5.30pm had similar efficacy to one used at regular intervals. In short, taking a drug once was just as effective as taking it four times, provided you took it at the right time of day. Professor David Ray of the University of Oxford uses his own inhaler “at the time when I think it’s going to be most effective” (the exact time is his secret, as “we have to be careful” about single-person anecdotes). As co-director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, the asthmatic professor has conducted his own research into body clocks and the respiratory disease. He also studies how matching medications with our circadian rhythms can improve the effectiveness of drugs. Chronopharmacology is a field filled with jaw-dropping studies to whip out at the pub: in 2011, researchers at the University of Birmingham monitored people who had their influenza jabs in the morning versus those who had them in the afternoon. One month on, the patients who received their vaccination between 9am and 11am had higher levels of anti-flu antibodies than patients jabbed between 3pm and 5pm. Our circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles of biological activity that are regulated by our internal clocks along with external cues, such as light. You sleep at night not just because your mum told you to, but because when your retina detects light it inhibits the production of the hormone melatonin, stimulating wakefulness. Our body temperature varies by as much as half a degree throughout the day: usually, we’re coldest at 4am and hottest just in time for the News at Six. Our hormones, immune cells, and organ functions also fluctuate; mouse livers, for example, grow almost 50% in size during the day before shrinking at night. Many chronobiologists (“chrono” is the Greek word for “time”) believe we should use this information to improve medical interventions. Chronotherapy is an unusual field with both a long and short history. On the one hand, way back in 1698, English physician Sir John Floyer noticed that he had asthmatic fits after sleeping and, therefore, “by late sitting up I have put by the fit for a night or two”. There are also a number of decades-old groundbreaking studies: the Denver asthma report for one, as well as research undertaken in Canada between 1976 and 1991, which found that children given chemotherapy for their leukaemia in the evening had better disease-free survival rates than those treated in the morning. In some areas, timed medicine is already happening, for instance, many doctors prescribe certain statins – drugs for high cholesterol – to be taken at night to correspond with the time when your body produces the most cholesterol. But there is still caution. According to Robert Dallmann, a circadian biologist and biomedical sciences professor at the University of Warwick, the field is in many ways still emerging. “There was, for a long time, a feeling that this was all much too complicated,” he says. While Floyer might have noticed his asthma worsening at night, he wasn’t equipped to know why. “Notice was only really taken once the field started to get to the molecular mechanisms underlying lots of this, because before it was mostly a black box,” Dallmann says. In 2017, the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three American geneticists who had discovered the molecular mechanisms controlling our biological clocks. In layperson’s terms: the scientists had isolated a gene that controls the biological rhythms of fruit flies and found that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates within cells at night and degrades during the day. “I think the nominators could see all this exciting science and see that it hadn’t really translated into the clinic,” says Ray. “We are in a quite exciting time now where there’s a lot of early-phase work showing what massive potential there is here.” Potential, of course, has pitfalls. If scientists discovered that flu vaccinations are more effective in the morning over a decade ago, then why isn’t everyone being jabbed at 9am? Well, first, that would mean the NHS could only issue half as many jabs in a week. Second, it can be hard enough getting people to attend their immunisation appointments at all; limiting them to a narrow window could mean that pregnant women with morning sickness miss their appointment, for example, which is far worse than simply being jabbed in the afternoon. There’s also the fact, Ray says, “that health systems are bureaucratic, they’re under financial pressure. It’s like a supertanker trying to change course.” And, of course, healthcare providers don’t want to jump the gun before enough evidence has accumulated. One 2021 study of 63 healthcare workers in China found that Covid-19 vaccines were more effective when given in the morning. Later that year, a study monitoring 2,190 healthcare workers in the UK found that Covid vaccinations had better efficacy in the afternoon. The vaccinations in both studies were different, but a number of other factors complicate analysis of the results; for example, neither factored in participants’ medication history or sleep and shift-work patterns. Then there’s the matter of funding. For pharmaceutical companies, there are marketing and safety issues when it comes to producing drugs that should be taken at an exact time of day. What are the risks if someone takes it early or late? Already, approximately 30-50% patients with long-term conditions don’t adhere to their medication. But even without new medicine, chronopharmacology can be revolutionary: Ray says the field could “rescue” drugs that have previously failed clinical trials. It’s not uncommon for a drug to be groundbreaking in mice and ineffective in human trials. But in 2020, researchers from Harvard Medical School published a study which found that preventive stroke strategies that had worked in rodents but failed in humans may have done so because rats are nocturnal. Many trials test rats in the daytime, when they’re inactive, and test humans during the day, when they’re active and awake. “They were able to show that a lot of these promising drugs have probably been tested in humans at the wrong time of day,” Ray says. “That’s millions and millions and millions of pounds wasted and all those volunteers recruited and subjected to a trial.” The time of day a drug is administered could also change its side-effects, so drugs that were written off as too toxic could actually be safe within certain parameters. To save money and save lives, Ray argues that many trials should have “clock logic” embedded into them. Let’s say you need to take a drug at 8am for it to be effective, and for whatever reason – needy kids, a hangover, a fundamental disdain for the morning – you can’t. Theoretically, says University of Oxford pharmacology professor Sridhar Vasudevan, you could take one drug to change the timing of another – problem solved. Chronopharmacology isn’t just about matching medicines with your circadian rhythms: it’s also about creating medicine that affects the circadian system itself. Vasudevan became interested in circadian rhythms when he worked in psychiatry more than a decade ago. He noticed that sleep disturbance was prevalent “across the board” in depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. “When something goes wrong in the brain that leads to a mood dysfunction, you have associated sleep dysfunction,” he says. So, Vasudevan theorised, “If you can correct the sleep and circadian dysfunction, you can fix the other side, which is the mood.” In 2016, Vasudevan co-founded a company in the Oxford Centre for Innovation, named Circadian Therapeutics. He and his colleagues are identifying drugs to treat diseases related to circadian rhythm disorders. The team are currently working with blind veterans who have disrupted sleep cycles because light cannot reset their circadian rhythms. “Basically, they’re constantly jet-legged every single day,” Vasudevan says. “The idea is to have a drug that can mimic the effects of light on the brain, so that they can take it once a day and stabilise their sense of time.” Circadian Therapeutics are also developing drugs to help those with neurodegenerative disorders. “Sundowning” is a phenomenon whereby some people with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s become distressed and confused in the late afternoon. Vasudevan is looking into circadian modulators that could manage these symptoms. Of course we shouldn’t just manipulate our body clocks for the sake of it, as Vasudevan warns that taking one newly discovered drug to affect the timing of another could “introduce extra risk”. Still, there’s potential. “If the ideal time for you to take a drug is between 1am and 4am, most people are not going to wake up to take it,” Vasudevan says, “and sleep is extremely important in the healing process, regardless of what you’re recovering from.” In some circumstances – at some point in the future – taking one drug to change your circadian timing could help another drug work better. Drugs are not the only route to a healthy life. Chrono-nutrition and chrono-exercise are exactly what they sound like. In October 2021, a study from Harvard Medical School found that eating earlier affects the speed at which you burn calories and store fat – in short, the exact same meal could be far healthier eaten at 5pm than 9pm. In May, academics from Skidmore College in New York found that women who exercised in the morning burned more abdominal fat and reduced their blood pressure more than women who exercised in the evening – but, the later exercisers had “enhanced muscular performance”. Before you start swallowing 10am pills and going on 3pm jogs, it’s important to remember that our internal circadian biology does vary: some of us are morning people and some of us are evening people (this characteristic is known as a chronotype). Ray says your chronotype is affected by your age, gender and genes, and argues that in the future we’ll likely see personalised chronopharmacology based on “the clock phase of the person, rather than just going off the time on the clock on the wall”. Dallmann, who runs the Patho-Physiological Molecular Clocks Lab at Warwick University, has already used his research to work out what personally works for him. “I do implement some of the current knowledge on time-restricted eating,” he says, “and I choose my painkillers differently by time of day.” Still, it’s important to remember that for many medicines, the time of day they’re taken doesn’t matter at all. As Ray says: “If the disease you are targeting doesn’t change by time of day then it doesn’t matter what time of day you give the drug.” If a drug has a long half-life (ie it takes weeks for the substance to reduce by half in your body), then the time of day it’s taken doesn’t matter, because its concentration remains consistent. Sceptical scientists have also warned about being too enthusiastic. University of North Carolina biochemist Aziz Sancar has argued that when it comes to cancer, chrono-chemotherapy researchers have overstated positive findings and generalised from small studies in the past. But for now and for many, chronopharmacology remains emerging and exciting. “We have to be careful about overselling it. It can lead to dissatisfaction if you cry wolf,” says Ray. However, “We’re at that point where it’s exciting,” and people are increasingly aware of the field. “We’ve done focus groups with patients,” Ray says, “and as soon as you say: ‘We’d really like to hear your views about timing and how the time of day affects your disease,’ they’re over the moon – because, finally, someone is listening.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/07/instagram-threads-app-review","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-07T04:08:58Z","webTitle":"The launch of Meta's Threads proves yet again we are too much in awe of the internet | Van Badham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/instagram-threads-app-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/07/instagram-threads-app-review","fields":{"bodyText":"I came to social media to stay in touch with friends and family when I lived overseas. I stayed for its cornucopia of character development opportunities. As this last week has shown, they are on limitless offer. We all know by now that should you wish to improve your resilience to harassment and abuse, be a woman, express a nuanced political opinion on the internet and – little lady – just you wait. Having been on Twitter since one million years BC, I am as wizened from my beatings as Rooster freakin’ Cogburn. Yet this week’s internet lesson suggests for all the years I’ve been on social media, I’m not so wise. Yesterday, unusually, I was not distracted from my work by Twitter because I was distracted by the launch of Mark Zuckerberg’s new Twitter alternative, Threads. Is Elon Musk, new owner of Twitter, a genius? Yes, at creating opportunities for his rivals. Having bought Twitter at an eye-wateringly over-inflated US$44bn – seemingly because his ex-wife sent him a text message reading “Can you buy Twitter and then delete it, please!?” – Musk’s decisions since have resulted in six in 10 US adult site users choosing to spend less time on the platform. Briefly, Twitter has become unbearably janky to operate, verification systems are meaningless and it’s full of Nazis. If history and social media can agree on one fact alone, it’s that the only people who like Nazis are Nazis. 61% of Twitter’s power users lean left. So the search for somewhere people might chat macroeconomic policy, pineapple on pizzas and Taylor Swift tickets without sly threats of genocide has been on since “free speech” champion and aspiring internet comedian Musk hailed his own arrival at the company with a weak meme. That search turbo-charged this last week when Musk decided to limit how much content Twitter users were allowed to physically see. Questions on the theme of “Dude, isn’t advertising already one of your last income streams?” were responded to with – I shit you not – a poop emoji. Never one to miss an opportunity to slap Musk in a cage fight – well, until Elon’s mum intervenes – Meta/Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was bragging by first day’s end Threads had signed up 30 million new users. I was one of them, posting out the jokes no one pays me to write, engaging pleasantries with strangers I will never actually meet and hitting the block button on the obsessed weirdoes whose deranged projections of me have them harass me anywhere I appear. Just like I do on Twitter. And on its grumpy anarchist variation, Mastodon. And Bluesky. And Facebook. Instagram. TikTok. It occurred to me that I am on so many platforms now, I have little time left to make content to platform. There is an adjustment period as a culture confronts and psychologically adapts to new media and technology, and it’s longer than we realise. This last 24 hours of staring at my phone asking “what am I doing this for?” has me thinking that for all the sassy talk about “digital natives” and the “extremely online”, we are still so in awe of what the internet can do we outsize our deference to it – the way we once dipped our heads before thunder, believing the rumbles came from Thor. Watch us ritualistically refresh feeds. Observe the human sacrifices performed when a marketing department decides five catty comments constitute “brand damage”. What I find most disturbing about AI language models like ChatGPT is not the app’s capacity to construct plausible sentences, it’s the human capacity to believe if a machine’s sentence sounds plausible, it must be true as holy writ. As someone who got ChatGPT to write their obituary, please extend your sincere condolences to my imaginary widowed wife Emma, if not to my actual husband, Ben. The technological awe shown towards our new media reminded me of early audiences for motion pictures – apparently unable to discern a projection of an oncoming train from the real thing, they were said to flee the cinemas in terror. A little research revealed that while there were isolated incidents of individuals freaked out by unfamiliar images, rushing overwrought audience-members into ambulances was “the best possible publicity for the picture”. The real “train effect” was the promoters’ cynical construction of this “unsophisticated other”. It allowed them to create an audience of people culturally aligned to the new technology, united in a smug conviction they possessed a superior understanding of it. When the authoritarian movements of the early 20th century pumped out propaganda through their new media, a generation of minds over whom the cinema had this cultural power were the ones who believed it. Disinformation and propaganda saturate the internet now. And we’re all here. The billions burned by Musk on Twitter, the Zuckerberg investment in Threads, the venture capital splashed on the new platforms – they all speak to the awesome power that internet tech and its media has on the powerful and, through them, to the rest of us. The dire lesson offered now is of the critical cultural danger we are in – until we can rightsize the internet in our heads, and in our lives.

The nation is up in arms. MPs, peers, mayors, editors, villagers and about 18,000 people on a Facebook group are all gnashing their teeth. Even the demolition contractor, whose digger was actually booked before the pub caught fire, is embarrassed. Many of these worthies may not have known of the pub before. They sure do now, and they all want it put back, brick by crooked brick. There is a tried and tested procedure for securing a building that is of “architectural and historic interest”. It is called protective listing. An 18th-century pub would surely have qualified. Historic England, which wants the Crooked House restored, said it received a request to list the building a few days before the fire. But such a renowned building should have been listed a long time ago. This is perhaps more evidence for the inadequacy of the current system in England – witness the ongoing row over saving the unlisted M&amp;S store on Oxford Street in London. The people of Himley had failed to register their pub under a local plan as “an asset of community value”. It is now reported that the pub’s owner recently “gutted” the interior of another Midlands pub, the Sarah Mansfield at Willey, which actually was put forward for such asset status. But this listing was overruled on appeal, which shows how local planning is still at the mercy of centralists. The idea that a civil servant studying an appeal can better judge the value of a pub than can local people must be absurd – after all, it merely requires a developer to cry “more housing” and Whitehall capitulates. Pubs are desperately threatened. Six years ago an attempt was made to correct the disastrous error of the Cameron government in easing change of use to allow pubs to be redeveloped at will. After a furious outburst, in 2017 that freedom was withdrawn. But about 7,000 pubs in England and Wales closed in the past decade. More than 150 were demolished or converted in the first quarter of this year alone, a rate 60% higher than last year. Change of use is allowed in the event of the pub being unprofitable for a set period of time – a test vastly eased by its destruction. In the case of the Crooked House, the police are inspecting suspected arson and have made no arrests. What matters is whether the fate of the Crooked House will serve as a warning or an encouragement to others. The restoration of what was a place of unique curiosity and delight to its village is perfectly possible, preferably at the expense of its demolishers. Rebuilding a “wonky” pub will require ingenuity, but it is no different in principle from the hundreds of effectively rebuilt Tudor pubs across the country. Disneyesque, perhaps, but what’s wrong with that? Another response should be more serious. It is that local democracy needs perpetually to be on its guard. It needs to flex every muscle, however puny, granted by the law and demand its rigorous enforcement. An example must be shown to the howling cacophony of developer lobbyists now charging across the English landscape, deriding democracy as nimbyism.

Or self-coup to be exact. The world watched its denouement dumbfounded on 6 January 2021 as thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the heart of US democracy, the Capitol in Washington, with cries to hang the vice-president, in an attempt to overturn an election and keep Trump in power. But, as the detailed executive summary of the report released by the congressional committee investigating the insurrection lays bare, Trump’s bid to usurp power began while the votes from the November 2020 presidential election were still being counted. That kicked off what amounted to a rolling coup attempt as an increasingly desperate president sought to compromise and corrupt officials from the US justice department to state election boards in an effort to find a way, any way, to have his defeat declared null and void. The seeds were sown by Trump as he watched the results roll in on election night. The president’s own campaign manager, Bill Stepien, had told him that the way the count was conducted in several states meant that early results were likely to give Trump the lead but that would be eroded as absentee and other postal votes were tallied. The count panned out as Stepien predicted and Trump’s aides cautioned the president that, for all his euphoria at the prospect of pulling off another astonishing upset, it was way too soon to be declaring victory. But all Trump saw was his numbers go up and then down. He brushed off his advisers and went on television. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election,” he declared. The following morning, Trump inevitably used Twitter to demand that the results already declared, and showing him ahead, be frozen: “STOP THE COUNT!” The report notes that almost none of Trump’s aides supported his claims, with the exception of the increasingly erratic former New York mayor and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. But that fed the narrative pushed by the president and his supporters that he was the victim of an establishment conspiracy. By the time the electoral college met on 14 December to cast and certify each state’s votes, many of Trump’s senior staff, cabinet secretaries and even members of his family, were pressing him to admit defeat. The president preferred to listen to Giuliani’s conspiratorial claims that the voting machines were rigged and suitcases of fake ballots had been used to tip the result against him. As Trump grew more desperate, he pressured Republican officials in key swing states he had lost to overturn the results. In early January, he called Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to demand he “find 11,780 votes” to reverse Joe Biden’s crucial victory in the state. “Trump also made a thinly veiled threat to Raffensperger and his attorney about his failure to respond to Trump’s demands: ‘That’s a criminal, that’s a criminal offense … That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer … I’m notifying you that you’re letting it happen,’” the report said. In Arizona, Trump targeted the Republican speaker of the state legislature, Russell “Rusty” Bowers. The president and Giuliani repeatedly called or met with Bowers to claim that Arizona’s results were fraudulent and to press him to replace the state’s members of the electoral college with ones who would vote for Trump. Bowers told Giuliani: “You are asking me do something against my oath, and I will not break my oath.” Trump exerted similar pressure on officials in Michigan, which he had won in 2016 but lost four years later. The president was pursuing a parallel track with the US justice department. The attorney general, William Barr, grew so exasperated with Trump’s actions that he resigned. The president called or met with Barr’s replacement, Jeff Rosen, nearly every day of the following weeks in an attempt to pressure the justice department “to find factual support for his stolen election claims and thereby to assist his efforts to reverse election results”, according to the report. When Rosen repeatedly told Trump that there was no evidence for the allegations, Trump replied: “Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.” When this didn’t fly either, Trump turned to those he could always trust: the men and women in the red Make America Great Again caps. As he saw it, the “deep state” was working to rob him of his rightful victory. Trump would count on the people to save him. And so the president summoned the faithful to Washington for a rally on January 6, the day his vice-president, Mike Pence, was to preside over a joint meeting of both houses of Congress to count and approve the electoral college votes, a routine affair for much of the US’s existence. Trump’s efforts to pressure states to withhold their tallies in the hope of delaying the endorsement of Biden’s victory had come to naught and a wave of court challenges to the results failed. Pence made clear to Trump that he would fulfil his duty and that the president’s days in the White House were numbered. Trump told the world a different story. On the evening of 5 January, he released a statement falsely claiming that his vice-president was “in total agreement” with him that Pence had the power to prevent endorsement of the results by “sending them back” to the states. In the early hours of the following morning, Trump tweeted: “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect &amp; even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!” Pence did not agree and, astonishingly, refused to take his own president’s call on the morning of the rally. When Trump finally reached his vice-president by phone, the president called him “a wimp” for refusing to block Congress from approving Biden’s victory. The crowd that arrived for the Washington rally was already stoked by weeks of Trump’s tweets and conspiratorial claims bolstered by Fox News and other rightwing broadcasters. The committee’s report noted that far-right militia groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters were also instrumental in spreading the false claims of fraud. “President Trump’s supporters believed the election was stolen because they listened to his words, and they knew what he had called them to do; stop the certification of the electoral count,” the report said. It noted that supporters tweeted messages ahead of the rally predicting what would happen. “IF TRUMP TELLS US TO STORM THE FUKIN CAPITAL IMA DO THAT THEN!” said one. Others circulated flyers proclaiming “#OccupyCongress” over images of the Capitol. The report records that the intelligence services had wind of all of this, and warned the president and his staff. Some of Trump’s aides urged him to make a public statement disavowing violence. The president refused. His speech on January 6 instead made clear who he regarded as the real villain of the moment. As the congressional report recorded, Trump told the assembled crowd: “Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country.” The president added a veiled threat: “If you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.” The report records the reaction of Trump supporters at the rally. “I’m telling you, if Pence caved, we’re going to drag motherfuckers through the streets. You fucking politicians are going to get fucking drug through the streets,” said one. And then the mob headed Pence’s way. The report concluded that the Proud Boys militia led the attack on Congress. “Multiple Proud Boys reacted immediately to President Trump’s December 19th tweet and began their planning,” it said. Someone erected an imitation gallows in front of the Capitol. As the mob chanted “Hang Mike Pence”, the vice-president fled his office near the Senate chamber but refused to leave the building. The protesters passed within 40ft. Pence was not the only target. The report records that one woman was looking for the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, “to shoot her in the frigging brain”. By the time the crowd broke through the barriers around the Capitol, beating police officers with flag poles and smashing their way into the corridors of Congress, Trump was back in the White House. Alarmed aides pleaded with him to make a call to stop the violence. Trump instead sent out yet another tweet denouncing Pence for failing to overturn the election result. Finally, he was pressured into acting. “As the evidence demonstrates, the rioters at the Capitol had invaded the building and halted the electoral count.

Washington’s rapid reaction to the Iranian text, which had been delivered shortly before 3am on Friday Tehran time, directly contradicted Tehran’s claims that its proposals presented “a constructive approach” aimed at “finalising the negotiations”. Only minutes after the Iran proposals were received by the EU and passed on to Washington, the Biden administration gave it a provisional, but abrupt, thumbs down. “We can confirm that we have received Iran’s response through the EU,” a state department spokesman said. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive.” An unnamed US official was quoted in Politico as saying: “Based on their answer we appear to be moving backwards.” It is not clear what was in the Iranian text that was the latest round in a to-and-fro exchange with Washington aimed at tweaking a draft agreement presented by the EU on 8 August. Iran gave its first response to the draft on 15 August, which was followed by a response from the US. The latest Iranian document was, in turn, a reply to the US text. Officials on both sides had been cautiously optimistic about the possibility of converge on a final agreement that will revive a 2015 nuclear deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. That agreement has been severely eroded since Donald Trump withdrew US participation in 2018 and reintroduced sanctions. Last week, John Kirby, the US national security spokesman, had hailed what he called Iranian concessions and on Wednesday this week said the White House remained “hopeful” there would be a deal. Early on Friday in Tehran, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, had said Iran’s latest text presented “a constructive approach with the aim of finalising the negotiations”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, had also struck an optimistic note on Wednesday in an address to French diplomats in Paris, saying he hoped a new deal could be agreed on “in the next few days”. But Ali Alizadeh, a member of the Iranian parliament security commission had dampened that optimism, by warning that the US position was not aligned with the EU draft text, saying it had dashed his earlier hopes that agreement was days away. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said Iran still needed stronger guarantees that the lifting of US sanctions would have a practical impact, and could not readily be reimposed by future US administrations. “On guarantees, we need a stronger text,” the minister said in Moscow at a press conference with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Joe Biden has said he can guarantee US compliance with the agreement under his presidency but not by future administrations – in effect giving Iran only a two-year guarantee of sanctions relief. The US has tried to give Tehran comfort by vowing that any trade or investment deals signed before a future US administration left the agreement would be legally immune from US sanctions for as long as five years. Iran is also seeking guarantees that by the time the agreement comes fully into force, the west will entirely drop its three-year inquiry into unexplained nuclear particles found at nuclear sites before 2003. The EU has suggested the inquiry might be dropped so long as credible explanations are provided. Iran fears the probe’s continued existence might be used as a pretext to maintain or reimpose sanctions. The Russian envoy to the nuclear talks in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, urged the west to relent saying: “No current illegal activities are taking place there.” One of the most difficult issues has been how to handle Iran’s advanced centrifuges and surplus stock of uranium enriched by the Iranians in breach of the original agreement. The west wanted the destruction of these centrifuges or their removal from Iran, but Iran only wants to dismantle and store these devices within Iran. Iran argues that the warehousing of the centrifuges in an IAEA supervised building will act as a sword of Damocles, and serve as a guarantee that the US will abide by the agreement. US Republicans also want guarantees that enriched surplus uranium will not be sent to Russia, without UN oversight. Israeli officials say the deal opens a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon since it will be allowed to begin operating advanced centrifuges by 2026 and then enrich more uranium at higher levels by 2031. But advocates of the deal say the alternative, no deal at all – is worse, and these expiry dates can be extended in negotiations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/aug/01/techscape-environment-cost-ai-artificial-intelligence","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T10:40:33Z","webTitle":"TechScape: Turns out there’s another problem with AI – its environmental toll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/01/techscape-environment-cost-ai-artificial-intelligence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/aug/01/techscape-environment-cost-ai-artificial-intelligence","fields":{"bodyText":"Technology never exists in a vacuum, and the rise of cryptocurrency in the last two or three years shows that. While plenty of people were making extraordinary amounts of money from investing in bitcoin and its competitors, there was consternation about the impact those get-rich-quick speculators had on the environment. Mining cryptocurrency was environmentally taxing. The core principle behind it was that you had to expend effort to get rich. To mint a bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, you had to first “mine” it. Your computer would be tasked with completing complicated equations that, if successfully done, could create a new entry on to the blockchain. People began working on an industrial scale, snapping up the high-powered computer chips, called GPUs (graphics processing units), that could mine for crypto faster than your off-the-shelf computer components at such pace that Goldman Sachs estimated 169 industries were affected by the 2022 chip shortage. And those computer chips required more electricity to power them; bitcoin mining alone uses more electricity than Norway and Ukraine combined. The environmental cost of the crypto craze is still being tallied – including by the Guardian this April. The AI environmental footprint A booming part of tech – which uses the exact same GPUs as intensely, if not moreso, than crypto mining – has got away with comparatively little scrutiny of its environmental impact. We are, of course, talking about the AI revolution. Generative AI tools are powered by GPUs, which are complex computer chips able to handle the billions of calculations a second required to power the likes of ChatGPT and Google Bard. (Google uses its own similar technology, called tensor processing units, or TPUs.) There should be more conversation about the environmental impact of AI, says Sasha Luccioni, a researcher in ethical and sustainable AI at Hugging Face, which has become the de facto conscience of the AI industry. (Meta recently released its Llama 2 open-source large language model through Hugging Face.) “Fundamentally speaking, if you do want to save the planet with AI, you have to consider also the environmental footprint [of AI first],” she says. “It doesn’t make sense to burn a forest and then use AI to track deforestation.” Counting the carbon cost Luccioni is one of a number of researchers trying – with difficulty – to quantify AI’s environmental impact. It’s difficult for a number of reasons, among them that the companies behind the most popular tools, as well as the companies selling the chips that power them, aren’t very willing to share details of how much energy their systems use. There’s also an intangibility to AI that stymies proper accounting of its environmental footprint. “I think AI is not part of these pledges or initiatives, because people think it’s not material, somehow,” she says. “You can think of a computer or something that has a physical form, but AI is so ephemeral. Even for companies trying to make efforts, I don’t typically see AI on the radar.” That ephemerality also exists for end users. We know that we’re causing harm to the planet when we turn on our cars because we can see or smell the fumes coming out of the exhaust after we turn the key. With AI, you can’t see the cloud-based servers being queried, or the chips rifling through their memory to complete the processing tasks asked of it. For many, the huge volumes of water coursing through pipes inside data centres, deployed to keep the computers powering the AI tools cool, are invisible. You just type in your query, wait a few seconds, then get a response. Where’s the harm in that? Putting numbers to the problem Let’s start with the water use. Training GPT-3 used by 3.5m litres of water through datacentre usage, according to one academic study, and that’s provided it used more efficient US datacentres. If it was trained on Microsoft’s datacentres in Asia, the water usage balloons to closer to 5m litres. Prior to the integration of GPT-4 into ChatGPT, researchers estimated that the generative AI chatbot would use up 500ml of water – a standard-sized water bottle – every 20 questions and corresponding answers. And ChatGPT was only likely to get thirstier with the release of GPT-4, the researchers forecast. Estimating energy use, and the resulting carbon footprint, is trickier. One third-party analysis by researchers estimated that training of GPT-3, a predecessor of ChatGPT, consumed 1,287 MWh, and led to emissions of more than 550 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, similar to flying between New York and San Francisco on a return journey 550 times. Reporting suggests GPT-4 is trained on around 570 times more parameters than GPT-3. That doesn’t mean it uses 570 times more energy, of course – things get more efficient – but it does suggest that things are getting more energy intensive, not less. For better or for worse Tech boffins are trying to find ways to maintain AI’s intelligence without the huge energy use. But it’s difficult. One recent study, published earlier this month, suggests that many of the workarounds already tabled end up trading off performance for environmental good. It leaves the AI sector in an unenviable position. Users are already antsy about what they see as a worsening performance of generative AI tools like ChatGPT (whether that’s just down to their perception or based in reality isn’t yet certain). Sacrificing performance to reduce ecological impact seems unlikely. But we need to rethink AI’s use – and fast. Technology analysts Gartner believe that by 2025, unless a radical rethink takes place in how we develop AI systems to better account for their environmental impact, the energy consumption of AI tools will be greater than that of the entire human workforce. By 2030, machine learning training and data storage could account for 3.5% of all global electricity consumption. Pre-AI revolution, datacentres used up 1% of all the world’s electricity demand in any given year. So what should we do? Treating AI more like cryptocurrency – with an increased awareness of its harmful environmental impacts, alongside awe at its seemingly magical powers of deduction – would be a start.

The ruling by Tokyo district court centred on whether senior Tepco management could have predicted a serious nuclear accident striking the facility after a powerful tsunami. Four defendants, including Tepco’s president at the time of the disaster, Masataka Shimizu, were ordered to pay the sum, while a fifth was not found liable for damages, according to the Kyodo news agency. The plant in Fukushima, 150 miles north of Tokyo, experienced meltdowns in three of its six reactors after it was struck by a tsunami on 11 March 2011, flooding the backup generators. The tsunami, which was triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake, killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. The meltdowns at Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl 25 years earlier, caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of who have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2012 by 48 Tepco shareholders, is the first to find company executives liable for damages connected to the Fukushima disaster, which shook Japan’s faith in nuclear energy and resulted in widespread closures of atomic power plants. The plaintiffs had sought a record ¥22tn in damages. The executives found liable are unlikely to have the capacity to pay the full amount, according to media reports, but will be expected to pay as much as their assets allow. Tepco did not comment on the ruling, saying it would not respond to individual lawsuits, according to Kyodo. The court said the company’s countermeasures against tsunami “fundamentally lacked safety awareness and a sense of responsibility”. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck in March 2011, and that it had done everything possible to protect the plant. But an internal company document revealed in 2015 that it had been aware of the need to improve the facility’s defences against tsunami more than two years before the disaster, but had failed to take action. Plaintiffs also cited a government report that showed Tepco had predicted in June 2008 that the Fukushima plant could be hit by tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres in height after a major offshore earthquake. The court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures.

Russian airstrikes hit several civilian structures in the city, including a five-storey building, said the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul, adding “likely, there are people under the rubble”. Deputy defence minister of Ukraine, Hanna Maliar, has reported small incremental advances for Ukrainian forces near Bakhmut and Toretsk. She said in a message on Telegram that Ukraine had advanced 250m in the direction of Bakhmut in the area of the Berkhiv reservoir, and 200m in the Toretsk direction. She also claimed that 3 sq km of territory had been captured in the Berdiansk direction. Russia’s defence ministry has released video footage of what it claims were German-made Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles captured by Russian forces in a battle with Ukrainian forces. In a message on Telegram, the ministry said some of the vehicles still had their engines running, illustrating the rapid flight of the crews during the battle. The location and timing of the video footage has not been independently verified. Russian military bloggers appear to be claiming that Makarivka, one of the villages that Ukraine said it had liberated in the last couple of days, is back in Russian hands. The claims have not been independently verified. Forty-one people are still missing in the floods caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, while the death toll now stands at 10, Ukrainian officials have said. Regional head Oleksandr Prokudin reports there are currently 3,600 houses in 31 settlements that remain flooded on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro. The water level has dropped by 27cm, and in the past day water has receded from 200 houses. On Monday, Ukraine accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing Kyiv’s counteroffensive. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. Russian media reported that a Ukrainian missile strike on the southern Zaporizhzhia front killed an experienced Russian general. “As a result of an enemy missile attack, the Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, was killed,” the prominent pro-war blogger Voenkor said in a Telegram post. Goryachev, a decorated commander, previously led Russian troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria. The Russian defence ministry is yet to comment on the reports. Early morning shelling by Ukraine on two villages in Russia’s Kursk region damaged several houses and disrupted gas and electricity supply, according to the local governor. A fire broke out at an oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region overnight, Russia’s RBK news outlet reported, citing the local city administration. RBK reported that the fire was now contained and its cause was not immediately clear. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will arrive in Kyiv on Tuesday to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, before heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/aug/09/tina-modotti-the-revolutionary-photographer-who-was-more-than-just-an-it-girl","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-09T14:10:59Z","webTitle":" ‘She’s hard to pin down’: the ‘avant-garde It girl’ who became a revolutionary photographer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/09/tina-modotti-the-revolutionary-photographer-who-was-more-than-just-an-it-girl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/09/tina-modotti-the-revolutionary-photographer-who-was-more-than-just-an-it-girl","fields":{"bodyText":"One morning in the mid-90s, the art historian Patricia Albers and her husband drove out to a farm in Oregon, looking for clues that would bring her closer to a woman she had encountered a decade before. She had been perusing an exhibition celebrating the work of California photographer Edward Weston, yet, wandering through the gallery space, it was the photographs of his Italian lover and protege, taken in Mexico in the 1920s, that especially piqued her interest. Who was she, Albers wondered? However, Tina Modotti wasn’t so easy to find. It would take years of detective work for Albers to locate the missing fragments that would bring her subsequent biography, which was published in 1999, to life. “Modotti lived in eight different countries so it’s hard to fit all the pieces together into a coherent whole,” Albers says from her home in California. That is why her discovery in 1994 of a trunkful of Modotti’s letters and photographs, in a dusty attic in Oregon, was such a pivotal moment. While researching her book, Albers’ sleuthing led her to the family of Modotti’s first partner, the American poet Roubaix “Robo” de L’Abrie Richéy, and to a musty trove that contained more than 100 images by the Italian photographer, mostly small contact prints that had been gifts to Robo’s family. “It was like going through her desk drawers, it had an aroma of the past,” Albers recalls. It also gave her the archival material she needed to finally tell her story. Some may still regard Modotti as the “It girl of the avant garde”, undoubtedly guided by the bohemian circle of 1920s Mexico City in which she moved, but delve into her life and work and you will uncover a far more complex figure; a socially conscious artist and activist whose output, although cut short at the age of 45, was shaped by some of the most significant historical events of the early 20th century. “There is a complicity with her subjects because she is working with them and you sense that rapport,” Albers says , looking at a photograph Modotti took in Mexico in 1927 – one of the many “forgotten” images that now reside at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMoma). A pair of weather-beaten hands clasp two huddled knees as our gaze travels downward to the elderly man’s battered sandals. Albers is particularly drawn to Modotti’s photographs of working tools, she tells me: a hand on a spade, a fisher throwing a net, the baker boy with a basket on his head. “Those sandals are like tools in themselves,” she muses. “It’s what one needs to make a living.” This striking image is just one of the nearly 250 that makes up a new retrospective of Modotti’s photography at Barcelona’s Fundación Mapfre, the most extensive exhibition to date, and one that its curator Isabel Tejeda Martín hopes will “break from the iconic figure of the hypersexualised muse”. In other words, moving further away from the “passive model” she was often perceived to be and turning closer towards the “active citizen” she actually was. The exhibition takes a biographical approach because “it is unavoidable if you want to understand Modotti,” Tejeda Martín says. Born into a working-class family in Udine, in north-east Italy, Modotti emigrated to the US in 1913: first to San Francisco when she was 16, then to Los Angeles in her early 20s, where she became a silent movie actor and modelled for Weston. The inclusion of Weston’s work in this exhibition is important, Tejeda Martín says, “to highlight the differences in their gaze”. In 1923, she and Weston moved to Mexico City, where Modotti followed Weston’s lead, a biographical detail that often relegates her to “an apprentice” who never broke free from his schooling. Tejeda Martín is determined to change this narrative, a re-examination that is shared by SFMoma’s head of photography Erin O’Toole. “I find that people oversimplify the differences and often it feels very gendered, which I naturally resist,” she says. “Clearly Modotti learned a lot from him, but the influence went back and forth.” So much so that when it comes to their early photography in Mexico, it has sometimes been hard to tell them apart. Modotti learned quickly. A year after her arrival in the Mexican capital, she became the “official” photographer of the muralists – at the express invitation of its titan, Diego Rivera – taking hundreds of pictures of his first large-scale fresco project at the Secretariat of Public Education. Initially tentative in her approach, it wasn’t until Modotti’s politics deepened that her path peeled away from Weston’s. The pivot, for Albers, occurred in 1927 when she officially joined the Mexican Communist party and “her whole attitude towards photography changed”. One of her most acclaimed pictures, Workers Parade – a geometric sea of wide-brimmed hats – was taken during a May Day demonstration in 1926. “Weston would never do Workers Parade,” Albers says. That’s where the fusion began, mixing “artistic rigour with political power”. Galvanised by her working-class roots, Modotti moved away from the formalist modernism she had learned, and homed in on the social realities she was observing around her: a child labourer on his lunch break, a woman carrying wood, a man hauling a bale of hay. “I try to produce not art but honest photographs,” Modotti said at the time she was taking them. Tejeda Martín calls it “embodied” photography: “Empathy, for her, is the key concept, it’s in everything she sees.” For instance, a boy defecating in the street (1926-29) brings in questions of dignity: “She cannot forget that she was also a child worker and that it is difficult being in a world like that, exploited by capitalism.” In this sense, she is present on both sides of the camera, because she is equally “the point of view and the scope.” Her gaze also radically captured the female experience and her photographs of the Indigenous women of Mexico show us how. In the dusty streets of Oaxaca, “everything is carried on the head by the women in Tehuantepec” as a worker’s impassive gaze matches ours under her heavy load. The same year, in 1929, Modotti focused her lens on what the feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey later called “the labour of mothering” in a series of images that document the simultaneous intimacy and exertion of breastfeeding. “Women producing the next generation of workers,” as Tejeda Martín calls it. “When Modotti photographed Indigenous women,” Tejeda Martín writes in the exhibition’s accompanying text, “her vision vindicated the feminine from a labour and social perspective.” No doubt this is why her subsequent revival occurred alongside the second wave of feminist theory in the 1970s. After she died stateless in Mexico, in 1942, Modotti’s work became largely forgotten, her negatives so scattered that many were lost. It would take the efforts of Riccardo Toffoletti, a fellow Udinese photographer, for things to change. In 1973, he recovered and exhibited 30 vintage prints in her home town. Moma responded five years later with a small installation of her work. Then, in the early 1980s, a pioneering exhibition curated by Mulvey and Peter Wollen, at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, would bring Modotti face-to-face with another neglected female artist, her friend and comrade, the now exoticised and commodified Frida Kahlo. So why, then, did Modotti disappear for so long? “I’m loth to go along with the idea that the key reason she fell off the map was because she was a communist,” O’Toole says. “Sure, she was a communist, and in the US after her death there was a lot of fearmongering around communism” – but her story is more complicated than that, she argues. “There are aspects of misogyny there, in that female photographers are less interesting to people.” After a short spell of only eight years taking photographs, Modotti was expelled from Mexico in 1930 after Julio Antonio Mella, a Cuban revolutionary, was assassinated as he walked home with Modotti by his side (Modotti was arrested before being cleared of the murder). She subsequently gave up photography, although questions linger as to whether this is irrefutably the case. Taking into her consideration her subsequent movements from Berlin, to Moscow, and finally Spain – where she took on a range of political and humanitarian work during the Spanish civil war – perhaps one thing is clear. “She’s hard to pin down,” O’Toole says. “She became an American as far as I can understand, but she spent very little of her life in the US, so is she an American photographer?” Additionally, there are the rumours about her untimely death. Was it heart failure in the back of a taxi or was Rivera right in suggesting that it was a politically motivated crime? And so the question marks in this extraordinary woman’s story remain. “People continue to be interested in her work in much the same way as Kahlo,” O’Toole says. Because like Kahlo: “Her story keeps the work alive.” • Tina Modotti is at the Fundación Mapfre, Barcelona, until 3 September."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/27/china-building-overseas-naval-bases-across-asia-and-africa-say-analysts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-27T13:22:28Z","webTitle":"China may be planning overseas naval bases in Asia and Africa, say analysts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/china-building-overseas-naval-bases-across-asia-and-africa-say-analysts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/27/china-building-overseas-naval-bases-across-asia-and-africa-say-analysts","fields":{"bodyText":"China’s military may be planning to build a host of overseas naval bases, as it hopes to protect shipping routes and strengthen its ability to resist sanctions from the US and its allies, analysis has found. Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Bata in Equatorial Guinea and Gwadar in Pakistan are the three most likely locations for a Chinese naval base to be established in the next two to five years, according to an analysis by AidData, a US-based research institute, published on Wednesday. The report’s authors considered the amount of development financing issued by Chinese state-owned banks to port projects, the strategic value of existing infrastructure and strong relationships with host country governments, among other factors, to come up with a list of eight leading options for future Chinese naval bases. China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) currently only has one overseas military base in Djibouti, on the coast of the Horn of Africa. But as the rivalry between the US and China heats up, Beijing is catching up with Washington’s overseas maritime strength. Unlike the US, China is not party to international defence alliances – its only formal defence treaty is with North Korea. That makes developing overseas naval bases a priority for China’s military development, argue the AidData researchers. PLAN’s future ambitions may be closely aligned with China’s belt and road initiative. Four of the eight bases shortlisted by AidData are in Africa. Although China’s most pressing maritime ambitions are in the South China Sea and the Taiwan strait the report’s authors note that those operations could be conducted “entirely from the Chinese mainland and home naval bases”. PLAN bases farther afield would help China to preserve shipping routes, especially in the event of western sanctions, and gather intelligence. Hambantota port in Sri Lanka is considered to be the most likely location for a PLAN base in the near future, according to AidData. The port, which opened in 2010, was financed by a $306.7m loan from China Exim Bank, a state-owned development bank. AidData says that Beijing exercises “direct control over the facility”. In 2017, a Chinese firm took over control of the port of a 99-year lease, after the Sri Lankan government fell into difficulty servicing its overseas debts. Hambantota is often cited as an example of China’s “debt trap diplomacy”, but economists have argued the saga is more likely to reflect the Sri Lankan government’s instability rather than a concerted Chinese strategy to take control of an overseas base. “It is a time-honoured truth that the flag often follows trade,” said Blake Herzinger, a research fellow at the University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre. “While these port investments are unlikely, in most cases, to become formal bases for the PLAN, it is useful for the [Chinese Communist party] to have friendly locations where the PLAN can seek resupply and repair around the world.” On Tuesday, the US satellite imagery company BlackSky released updated images of the Ream naval base in Cambodia, where the US government suspects Beijing is building a facility to boost its naval presence in the region. The base is being built with Chinese assistance, but Beijing and the Cambodian government deny that a People’s Liberation Army presence will be allowed there. Defence analysts say a military base at Ream would give significant strategic benefits to China, including access to the Gulf of Thailand. The images show that a pier at the base is nearing completion, and is strikingly similar to the one at China’s Djibouti base. The pier is long enough to dock warships including aircraft carriers, BlackSky told the Financial Times, bolstering a previous assessment that the facility was being prepared for deepwater vessels. “It is worth noting the Cambodian navy operates only smaller patrol boats and is unlikely to need deep channels for its own uses,” AidData said in its report, which added that while other sites had a “headstart”, the Ream base was likely to be a future Chinese naval port."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","fields":{"bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest windfarms will double its capacity to 2,000 megawatts, providing enough power for 1.4m homes and accelerating Queensland’s exit from fossil fuel-sourced electricity. Spain-based Acciona Energia announced on Monday it would extend a windfarm already being built within the MacIntyre Precinct, a region about 200km south-west of Brisbane. That first stage involves just under $2bn in investment and the construction of 180 wind turbines, each standing about 230m high with 5.7MW of capacity. The MacIntyre region is being developed in partnership with CleanCo, the Queensland government’s renewable energy arm, and has an expected start date in 2024. “With this project we expect to dramatically accelerate the decarbonisation of Queensland’s electricity grid,” said Acciona’s managing director in Australia, Brett Wickham. “Workers can move from one large-scale project to the next whilst staying in the same area.” The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the expansion plan was “a strong endorsement that Queensland is a renewable energy superpower”. Two months ago, Queensland announced a $62bn plan to accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, including an end to coal-fired power stations by as early as 2035. Up until then, the state had been the national laggard in terms of the share of renewable energy in the grid. The announcement of another $2bn to be pumped into renewables comes days after the Clean Energy Council said new commitment for large wind and solar plants had hit the lowest level in at least five years in the September quarter.

The council blamed policy uncertainty in recent years – particularly at the federal level – for the investment slowdown. Known as the Herries Range project, Acciona’s extension would also host 180 wind turbines and support as many as 600 additional jobs during construction, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. The state’s energy and jobs plan boasts more than 50 large-scale renewable energy projects that are operational, under construction or have reached financial commitment from developers, the government said. Prior to Monday’s announcement, New South Wales had signed up the most new projects and capacity over the past year, with eight projects accounting for more than a third of new projects and 65% of new capacity nationally, according to the Clean Energy Council. Victoria had the next most with six new projects accounting for 19% of new capacity, while Queensland had six projects (at 6% of capacity) and WA with three projects (and 4% of capacity). Acciona’s focus on windfarms rather than solar may be a template for other big energy companies. AGL Energy, for instance, has plans to invest as much as $20bn over the next decade or so into renewables and storage as its coal-fired power plants close. Its focus is likely to be on wind rather than solar energy because of the need to complement rather than compete with the spread of solar panels on households across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
