The campaign group Together Against Sizewell C (Tasc) had launched a judicial review against the government’s decision to give the green light to the 3.2 gigawatt plant on the Suffolk coast, which is being built by French energy company EDF. The group said the government had failed to consider alternatives to nuclear power to meet its emissions targets when approving the project. It cited the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water-stressed, the threats to coastal areas from the climate crisis, and environmental damage. Mr Justice Holgate rejected the group’s challenge against the secretary of state for energy security and net zero in a written ruling at the high court on Thursday. Holgate ruled the government’s decision was in keeping with energy policy intended to achieve “diversity of methods of generation and security of supply”. He said the judicial review was an attempt to “rewrite the government’s policy aims by pretending that the central policy objective is … to produce clean energy, without any regard to diversity of energy sources and security of supply”. Tasc said it would continue its campaign and was examining options for how to do so. Sizewell got the go-ahead from government last year, when the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled a verdict from the independent Planning Inspectorate. The planning body had said that “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Kwarteng’s decision to override these concerns came against the backdrop of plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year, under an energy strategy drawn up under the former prime minister Boris Johnson. The strategy envisaged the UK sourcing up to 25% of its projected energy demand from nuclear by 2050. The Tasc chair, Jenny Kirtley, said: “Naturally, Tasc is disappointed, but this verdict does not signal the end of our efforts. Together with our lawyers we are examining all possible options open to us and can promise our supporters that in one form or another, this campaign will continue. “The Suffolk Heritage Coast cannot be sacrificed for such an unnecessary and inappropriate development, and we will examine every avenue of opposition until all are exhausted.” Sue Ferns, a senior deputy general secretary of the trade union Prospect, said the ruling “removes one of the blocks” to getting Sizewell C started. “Nuclear must play an important role in our energy mix as we race to net zero. We now need to get on with building Sizewell C, and secure the jobs, economic benefits and clean reliable energy it will bring.” A spokesperson for EDF’s Sizewell C project said the judgment “dismisses the challenge and underlines the confidence the people of east Suffolk can take in our plans for Sizewell C. “While the project has strong local support, we will continue to listen to the views of all east Suffolk residents as we have done for more than a decade. We are as determined as ever that this project will deliver as much long-term benefit as possible to the local area. “Work at our site will continue to prepare for full construction, which will unlock major benefits for Suffolk and the rest of Britain. As well as creating huge numbers of jobs, apprenticeships and investment, the project will lower energy costs for consumers and build a stronger homegrown low carbon electricity system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: concerns over climate impact on UK nuclear power sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","fields":{"bodyText":"Successive governments since the 1980s have had plans for new generations of nuclear power stations sited around the coasts of the United Kingdom. Although the main reason for building them, according to politicians, is to provide a low-carbon form of electricity to combat the climate crisis, no thought seems to have gone into what the climate crisis might do to the nuclear power stations. Prof Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, points out in the Town and Country Planning Association Journal that the eight sites identified in 2011 as suitable for new stations are the same as those identified half a century earlier, on which the first generation of nuclear power stations were built. The reason the sites were originally chosen was their remoteness, for safety, and their proximity to the sea, for cooling purposes. The latest reasoning is that they would have a better chance of public acceptance because two generations of local people have worked in the industry. The new installations are planned to operate for 60 years and will need another century after closure to cool sufficiently to remove the waste. Blowers, an opponent of the government plans, worries that ministers seem to have taken no account of sea level rise, intense storms and the prospect of flooding at these sites."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:56:15Z","webTitle":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK should bar technology developers from working on advanced artificial intelligence tools unless they have a licence to do so, Labour has said. Ministers should introduce much stricter rules around companies training their AI products on vast datasets of the kind used by OpenAI to build ChatGPT, Lucy Powell, Labour’s digital spokesperson, told the Guardian. Her comments come amid a rethink at the top of government over how to regulate the fast-moving world of AI, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, acknowledging it could pose an “existential” threat to humanity. One of the government’s advisers on artificial intelligence also said on Monday that humanity could have only two years before AI is able to outwit people, the latest in a series of stark warnings about the threat posed by the fast-developing technology. Powell said: “My real point of concern is the lack of any regulation of the large language models that can then be applied across a range of AI tools, whether that’s governing how they are built, how they are managed or how they are controlled.” She suggested AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which are governed by arms-length governmental bodies. “That is the kind of model we should be thinking about, where you have to have a licence in order to build these models,” she said. “These seem to me to be the good examples of how this can be done.” The UK government published a white paper on AI two months ago, which detailed the opportunities the technology could bring, but said relatively little about how to regulate it. Since then, a range of developments, including advances in ChatGPT and a series of stark warnings from industry insiders, have caused a rethink at the top of government, with ministers now hastily updating their approach. This week Sunak will travel to Washington DC, where he will argue that the UK should be at the forefront of international efforts to write a new set of guidelines to govern the industry. Labour is also rushing to finalise its own policies on advanced technology. Powell, who will give a speech to industry insiders at the TechUK conference in London on 6 June, said she believed the disruption to the UK economy could be as drastic as the deindustrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is expected to give a speech on the subject during London Tech Week next week. Starmer will hold a shadow cabinet meeting in one of Google’s UK offices next week, giving shadow ministers a chance to speak to some of the company’s top AI executives. Powell said that rather than banning certain technologies, as the EU has done with tools such as facial recognition, she thought the UK should focus on regulating the way in which they are developed. Products such as ChatGPT are built by training algorithms on vast banks of digital information. But experts warn that if those datasets contain biased or discriminatory data, the products themselves can show evidence of those biases. This could have a knock-on effect, for example, on employment practices if AI tools are used to help make hiring and firing decisions. Powell said: “Bias, discrimination, surveillance – this technology can have a lot of unintended consequences.” She argued that by forcing developers to be more open about the data they are using, governments could help mitigate those risks. “This technology is moving so fast that it needs an active, interventionist government approach, rather than a laissez-faire one.” Matt Clifford, the chair of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency, which the government set up last year, said on Monday that AI was evolving much faster than most people realised. He said it could already be used to launch bioweapons or large-scale cyber-attacks, adding that humans could rapidly be surpassed by the technology they had created. Speaking to TalkTV’s Tom Newton Dunn, Clifford said: “It’s certainly true that if we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don’t know how to control it, then that’s going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future. So I think there’s lots of different scenarios to worry about but I certainly think it’s right that it should be very high on the policymakers’ agendas.” Asked when that could happen, he added: “No one knows. There are a very broad range of predictions among AI experts. I think two years will be at the very most sort of bullish end of the spectrum.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T21:30:11Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","fields":{"bodyText":"Keir Starmer has described nuclear power as a “critical part” of the UK’s energy mix and pledged to get stalled projects over the line, as Labour positions itself firmly behind the technology. Before the Labour leader presents his net zero energy policies during a speech in Scotland early next week, the party said it would “push forward” nuclear to boost energy security, cut costs for consumers and create jobs. On Sunday Starmer accused the Conservatives of a “shambolic” failure to open any nuclear power plants during 13 years in power. On Monday he will visit Hinkley Point C in Somerset, one of a number of new plants still not operational despite having been identified in 2009 when Labour was last in power. “My government will lower household energy bills, create jobs and ensure Britain’s energy security. Nuclear is a critical part of the UK’s energy mix,” said Starmer, who claimed Tory failure to approve the new plans had cost 7,000 British jobs. However, another plank of the party’s energy plans came under renewed attack on Sunday from a union that is one of Labour’s biggest donors. Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, accused the Labour party of being naive over its plans to ban North Sea oil and gas production. Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. Smith said Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. Starmer’s promise to block new North Sea oil and gas exploration has received the backing of an eclectic range of high-profile groups, including environmental campaigners, trade unions and even the Women’s Institute. The radical pledge is a key plank of Labour’s environmental platform, but has angered business and political leaders in the north-east of Scotland, where the industry is concentrated. Starmer is being urged to stick to the plan in a letter signed by 139 organisations, including the Countryside Charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. The groups write: “We urge you to stand firm on Labour’s policy of no new oil and gas developments and its significant investment in well-planned, nature-positive renewables and energy efficiency, and to confirm more details on how Labour will support workers to transition from fossil fuels to good quality, secure green jobs during your speech in June.” Shadow ministers confirmed last month that the party intended to ban new domestic oil and gas developments as part of its strategy to achieve zero-carbon power by 2030. Starmer will formally announce the pledge as part of a speech later this month setting out his green agenda in more detail. The plans have drawn fire from Aberdeen-based business leaders and the Tories, with Grant Shapps claiming the policy was an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” and warning it would put jobs at risk and boost Russia’s global power. Shapps, the energy secretary, is due to make a decision within weeks over whether to approve drilling at the giant Rosebank oilfield off Shetland. Comments from Rishi Sunak – who has said it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in new UK oil and gas – have been interpreted as a sign that the government is prepared to give it the green light, although there have been warnings that Labour’s green policies could make it less attractive to investors. In an article for the Times, Ryan Crighton, the policy director of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “If the alternative is importing, at a greater carbon cost, then surely the UK should always favour domestic production, where we can control the regulatory environment.” The high-profile opposition to Labour’s plans has caused concern among environmental groups, with Labour recently having backtracked on a range of other policies, including a pledge to abolish university tuition fees. Starmer is also under pressure from some of his frontbench to change the remit of the party’s £28bn climate fund to allow it to invest in infrastructure projects that are not explicitly green in nature. Tessa Khan, the founder of Uplift, a group that campaigns for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, and which signed the letter, said: “We were disturbed by the way in which Labour’s position to oppose development of new oil and gas field has come under attack in the last week. We wanted to make it clear that it is a core position of the climate sector and more broadly among different sectors in the UK. It’s a mainstream position and backed up by climate science.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations will shut down on Saturday, 12 years after the Fukushima disaster in Japan accelerated the country’s exit from atomic energy. The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the country’s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-Württemberg in the south-west. The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europe’s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites – which provided about 6.5% of the country’s electricity in 2022 – after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the country’s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s. Germany has switched off 16 reactors since 2003. The final shutdowns have raised questions about security of energy supplies and the outlook for Germany’s carbon emissions. The country plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2038, with the first round of closures planned in 2030. However, its parliament approved emergency legislation to reopen mothballed coal-fired power plants to aid electricity generation last year. A push to build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas has also been accelerated since the Ukraine war began. Coal accounted for just over 30% of Germany’s electricity generation in 2022, ahead of wind – responsible for 22%, gas-fired generation at 13% and solar at 10%. Biomass, nuclear and hydroelectric power made up the bulk of the remainder. The thinktank Ember has estimated that Germany and Poland will be the EU’s two largest producers of coal-fired electricity in 2030, responsible for more than half of EU power sector emissions by that point. Advocates of nuclear power argue that it provides a low-carbon, reliable alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Critics say new projects are costly, frequently delayed and present environmental concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association, said the phaseout would worsen carbon emissions and “for a country supposedly renowned for its logical and evidence-driven approach is environmentally damaging, economically illiterate and deeply irresponsible”. He added: “At a time of heightened concern about energy security, Germany will be abandoning assets that can displace 34bn cubic metres of gas a year.” But Tom Burke, chair of the thinktank E3G, played down fears over energy security, and said a mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe meant concerns about power supplies next winter had eased. He said Germany’s renewables industry was growing and that improving grid connections and battery storage across the country would be key to moving the country’s energy system away from fossil fuels. “The coal is mainly being burnt for social and economic reasons, making sure the industry doesn’t shut down all at once,” said Burke. “You cannot have a technology transformation without a social transformation.” Germany’s abandonment of nuclear power is in contrast to the stated ambitions of the UK government, which last month kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear. Ministers have set up a delivery body for new nuclear projects and are running a competition for small nuclear reactors. However, progress on developing two existing large projects, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been slow, with the latter delayed and overbudget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/07/peter-dutton-ramps-up-nuclear-power-push-and-claims-labor-down-renewable-rabbit-hole","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T15:00:06Z","webTitle":"Peter Dutton ramps up nuclear power push and claims Labor down ‘renewable rabbit hole’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/peter-dutton-ramps-up-nuclear-power-push-and-claims-labor-down-renewable-rabbit-hole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/peter-dutton-ramps-up-nuclear-power-push-and-claims-labor-down-renewable-rabbit-hole","fields":{"bodyText":"The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has ramped up calls for nuclear power in Australia, casting the move as a way to avoid dependence on wind and solar technology from China and a natural next step from the Aukus pact. Dutton will make the comments on Friday at an event organised by the Institute of Public Affairs, a Liberal-aligned thinktank that has publicly opposed curbs on coal-fired power and has lobbied against the net zero by 2050 policy. He will use the speech in Sydney to call for a debate about removing the legislative ban on nuclear power in Australia, a step that was not taken during the nine years of Coalition government, in which he was a senior member. Dutton’s pitch comes just days before the Liberal National party in Queensland holds its state conference, where delegates are expected to propose several pro-nuclear resolutions. He is likely to find a receptive audience for the message at the IPA, given that the thinktank’s executive director, Scott Hargreaves, has publicly called for the scrapping of all subsidies for renewable energy and also urged political leaders to “hit the pause button on our headlong rush towards reliance on greater renewable energy”. In the speech, Dutton will argue that most of the leading solar panel manufacturers and wind turbine companies are based in China. “So in the Albanese government’s massive rollout of renewables, it is inevitable we will become heavily reliant on the Chinese market,” he will say. Dutton will say “there is no better example of the risk of over reliance on one market than what we saw with many European countries’ dependence on Russian gas”. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he says, “things turned sour overnight”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup By contrast, Dutton will say that Australia could source Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) or Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs) from the US, UK, France “and other trusted partners”. Dutton will point to the bipartisan commitment to building nuclear-powered submarines in Australia under the Aukus deal. “The submarines are essentially floating SMRs,” he will say. “The sheer amount of money being invested in research and development in the next generation nuclear-powered submarines will surely see military advancements complement the development of civil nuclear power industries around the world.” Dutton will say he sees nuclear “not as a competitor to renewables, but as a companion” and he wants “an Australia where we can decarbonise and, at the same time, deliver cheaper, more reliable and lower emission electricity”. “At the very least, I think the government should consider working swiftly to alter the legislative prohibitions to SMRs and MMRs so we do not position Australia as a nuclear energy pariah,” he will say. Dutton will accuse the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, of burrowing “so deeply down the renewable rabbit hole that he refuses to consider these new nuclear technologies”. “The new nuclear technology train is pulling out of the station. It’s a train Australia needs to jump aboard.” A report by the Australian Conservation Foundation in October said the next generation of nuclear reactors being advocated by the Coalition would raise electricity prices, slow the uptake of renewables and introduce new risks from nuclear waste. Last year Bowen ruled out consideration of nuclear power because he said “it is by far the most expensive form of energy”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has also mocked the push, saying that after “22 failed plans” the Coalition now wants “to go towards nuclear energy”. He has said in question time that Liberals must nominate “where the plants are going to be”. But the idea appears popular within parts of the Coalition’s base. Three pro-nuclear resolutions are set to be debated at the Queensland LNP conference this weekend, including one urging a Dutton-led government to provide “baseload energy, such as nuclear as an adjunct to coal”. Another proposed resolution wants the next LNP state government to “review the education curriculum to ensure that energy supply, including nuclear energy, and impacts of renewable energy are taught factually”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","fields":{"bodyText":"In December, Janica Jammes started a microgreens business in the basement of her home in Big Lake, Minnesota, just across the river from Xcel Energy’s nuclear plant in Monticello. At least once each day, she uses water from her well to nourish the plant trays. She delivers her product to customers within a 10-mile radius and says the business has been a success. But now she worries that her water could be contaminated by a leak of about 400,000 gallons of radioactive water that occurred in November at the plant, which is about 40 miles north-west of Minneapolis. Moreover, Jammes is upset that the company did not alert the public about the leak until March – and then detected a second leak, which the company described as smaller than the first one. “We don’t know for sure if” side-effects from the leaks “will happen or when anything will happen but just the lack of transparency is very concerning”, said Jammes, a 36-year-old mother of four. While Xcel Energy representatives have said the leaks did not affect local drinking water or pose a safety threat to residents, residents such as Jammes want more answers from the company. Independent nuclear energy experts agree that the company should have been more transparent, but they say that based on reports from state and federal agencies, they also do not think the leaks pose a health risk to residents or that the incidents will serve as a significant setback to efforts to promote the carbon-free power source in the US. “This leak, even though it was contained and poses no danger”, according to the official reports, “it should be used as some sort of wake-up call”, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor who specializes in nuclear safety at the University of Southern California. While some scientists see increasing nuclear energy as a crucial, safe way to reducing carbon emissions and increasing the country’s energy independence, the disasters at the Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima nuclear power plants continue to cause fears of the power source. “Nuclear is the only clean energy sector that has the capacity to” transition away from fossil fuels “on a large scale”, said Charlyne Smith, a senior nuclear energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an energy thinktank. “It is an industry that is highly scrutinized compared to other industries, and I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does a really good job at ensuring that safety is something that is practiced in the industry.” Even though Xcel did not announce the leak publicly, they notified the Regulatory Commission, which is a federal agency, and the state and in November, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The company reported that about 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium leaked from a pipe at the facility. The regulators concluded that the spill had not reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources near the plant. “While we immediately informed state and federal agencies, with no immediate safety risk, we focused on investigating the situation and containing the affected water in concert with our regulatory agencies,” Kevin Coss, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, stated in an email to the Guardian. “Making the announcement when we did allowed us to provide the public a more accurate and complete understanding of the leak and our plan to resolve it.” Smith said she agreed that the leak did not pose a significant safety risk but “learning about it months after really doesn’t help the industry”. After the announcement, Xcel held two open houses about the leaks. The company also shut the plant down after discovering the second leak but said it would reopen this week. Jammes was among hundreds of people to attend the meetings. She and others said they were frustrated that there was no presentation about the leaks and that company representatives just stood at tables and answered only some of attendees’ questions. “It was just a quick question and answer sort of thing, like if you have questions, then we’ll try to answer them, but it was very much: you’re going to hear what we want you to hear,” Jammes said. She wants to know why the pipe broke and what Xcel will do to prevent such accidents. Michael Voll, a 60-year-old warehouse associate, also criticized the company’s approach at the meetings. He has lived in Monticello for most his life and said Xcel, which opened the plant in 1971, has benefited the local economy. “You didn’t have to come from a nuclear submarine. You could go out there, and if your uncle or your dad worked there, you probably were going to get a job,” Voll said. He also remains a supporter of nuclear energy and has never feared the plant. But after the leaks and the public meetings, he said his trust in Xcel “is way down”. Xcel sent the pipe that leaked to an independent group, where experts are studying it to determine what caused it to fail, Coss, the Xcel spokesperson stated. “The results will help us understand whether there are other potential steps we need to take at the plant,” he wrote. The company also will conduct a “thorough inspection” of the plant while it’s offline for refueling this month, Coss added. Xcel “will work to maintain” the community’s trust, Coss wrote, “by thoroughly cleaning up the leaked tritium and providing prompt updates if anything about the situation changes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T17:18:08Z","webTitle":"UN nuclear watchdog says fighting near Ukraine power plant is ‘intensifying’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/29/un-nuclear-watchdog-says-fighting-near-ukraine-power-plant-is-intensifying","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” The negotiations have so far stalled on Russian refusal to withdraw its armed forces from the plant, a Ukrainian precondition for agreement. Grossi has repeatedly warned that a direct hit or a breakdown in safety systems could cause a catastrophe. “What we need is to protect the nuclear power plant, because if we don’t do that, there is a high risk of a major nuclear accident which is going to spare no one, Ukrainians or Russians,” Grossi told reporters on a visit to Washington earlier this month. He said that while he was trying to negotiate a protection zone, it would not try to attribute daily responsibility for the shelling. “I’m still engaged in the effort, so you may understand that it wouldn’t be very wise for me to start saying who is to blame. It’s a process. It is a complex negotiation,” he said. “So this is why we avoid getting into apportioning blame because it will be a never ending story. What we need is an agreement, a solid political commitment, not to do this.” “There is a quite obvious increase in the number of troops on both sides and military equipment,” he told the New York Times this week. “Our teams are also observing and hearing and seeing more military activity, including detonations, regular, almost permanent.” Zaporizhzhia is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, but all six of its reactors have been shut down. Two of them are in “hot shutdown”, meaning they continue to give up a limited amount of energy to power safety and heating systems. It is however a difficult state to maintain, and the 3,000 remaining Ukrainian workers there, a quarter of the normal staff, are facing constant stress and exhaustion. “Things continue but the situation is not sustainable,” Grossi said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T13:36:37Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/11/nuclear-power-too-expensive-and-slow-to-be-part-of-australias-plans-to-reach-net-zero-study-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-11T15:00:38Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power too expensive and slow to be part of Australia’s plans to reach net zero, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/11/nuclear-power-too-expensive-and-slow-to-be-part-of-australias-plans-to-reach-net-zero-study-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/11/nuclear-power-too-expensive-and-slow-to-be-part-of-australias-plans-to-reach-net-zero-study-finds","fields":{"bodyText":"Nuclear power should not form part of Australia’s plans to reach net zero emissions because it is too expensive and slow, according to the final report of a project that models how Australia might meet its 2050 climate target. The Net Zero Australia report, a partnership between major academic institutions and the management consultancy Nous Group, says the federal government has a major role to play in accelerating all options that could make a “material contribution” to achieving net zero. The release of the report comes days after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, ramped up calls for nuclear power in Australia and a debate about removing the legislative ban on nuclear power in Australia. The report includes major investment in batteries, solar, onshore wind, pumped hydro and transmission. Among renewable options, offshore wind was found to have the most uncertain pipeline, with the report concluding first power from offshore wind projects needed to occur in 2030. But the report concludes nuclear power should not be factored in to net zero plans and states that to “reduce renewable targets in the belief that nuclear will be deployed later at scale would create a material risk of not achieving net zero, or doing so at an excessive cost”. Richard Bolt, principal at Nous Group, said: “Nuclear power should not be in our plans, because it’s too expensive and slow. Only a dramatic fall in costs and prolonged renewable constraints would prompt a rethink.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report warns that Australia’s path to net zero carbon emissions in 2050 will require faster, broader and more innovative decarbonisation efforts and the pipeline of large-scale solar and onshore wind projects risks falling short of the required build rate. The report modelled six scenarios, all of which included a fleet of gas-fired peaking plants to provide back-up to renewables and storage but with “minimal” actual use of gas. The report also finds carbon capture utilisation and storage is a “crucial component of a net zero strategy” despite the technology not having delivered meaningful emissions cuts to date. In a scenario in which renewable energy deployment is constrained, the report finds blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen made using fossil fuels but with the C02 captured and stored, would be the dominant use for CCUS up to 2060. In scenarios where there is unconstrained use of renewables, the dominant use would be to offset emissions from the land use and aviation sectors. The report was produced by the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, Princeton University’s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, as well as Nous Group. It was funded by gifts and grants from Worley, a consulting firm to the energy and resources sectors, the chemical company Dow, the Future Fuels Cooperative Research Centre, the Future Energy Exports Cooperative Research Centre, APA Group and the Minderoo Foundation. Robin Batterham, an emeritus professor at the University of Melbourne and chair of the Net Zero Australia steering committee, said there were “too many uncertainties to map a single path to net zero”. “We need more options, stronger investment drivers and a larger pipeline of projects,” he said. The Australian Conservation Foundation was part of an advisory group that was consulted for the report. Its chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said renewables were at the heart of the conclusions the reports authors had reached. “Everything depends on how fast you can deploy renewables,” she said. “It also shows that when you accelerate renewables, gas for Australia essentially becomes a peaking fuel. A gas-fired Australia is not an option.” But she said some of the assumptions made about the role for CCUS were “heroic” given the technology had not worked at a large scale."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Here is a film that returns us to a thorny revisionist subject which I haven’t seen aired in documentary form since the film Pandora’s Promise in 2013 – which isn’t mentioned here, though a poster for it is visible in one shot. For many environmentalists, the last realistic hope we have to avert climate disaster is the great unthinkable, the great unmentionable: stop worrying and learn to love nuclear energy, because nuclear is a colossally efficient and very clean energy source. Like Pandora’s Promise, Atomic Hope revisits the case studies of Chornobyl and Fukushima and argues that, although clearly catastrophic, a mythology of horror has grown up around these events that has stymied all debate and shut down thought. The film doesn’t say so, but another way the eco-nuclear movement became tainted was perhaps a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the UN general assembly which made the case in 1989, partly to undermine the coal industry as a trade union powerbase. At any rate, here again is the argument: nuclear energy provides the clean, climate-friendly energy we need. Renewables such as wind and solar are important, but progress on them is desperately slow and time is running out. The risks of nuclear are real, but they are misunderstood and uncontextualised, safety measures have evolved and risk must in any case now be considered in the light of clear and present danger of the global harm from fossil fuels. But none of this is easy. Generations have been brought up on the idea that nuclear equals apocalypse. Convincing them of the opposite is a challenge. Guardian readers will know that George Monbiot has ventilated ideas on this issue. The inevitable question is: what does Greta think? This film was apparently made too late to include Thunberg’s startling intervention in October 2022, when she claimed the German government was wrong to close down nuclear plants in favour of coal.

And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply – for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate – just two weeks’ ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government’s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants – these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville – still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off “There’s not many left,” noted Peggy O’Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (“Britain’s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration”, Focus). But what your article didn’t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn’t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don’t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell’s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that “reversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests” and a goal that Labour should embrace (“Labour should reverse on not reversing Brexit”, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters’ winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to “Get Brexit Undone” would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK’s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (“Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially “world-leading” renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour’s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize. Investment in green infrastructure and support for green businesses (and the solutions they are creating) is the route to sound money and sustainable growth. Bruce Davis, co-founder and joint managing director, Abundance Investment Cirencester, Gloucestershire Books for all Iranian refugee Ali in Reading is quoted as saying: “All I want is an actual book to read but there are none here and there is no way I can afford them” (“English people try to help.

At a time of both deteriorating international relations and the escalation of nuclear sabre-rattling, there are now said to be an estimated 12,512 warheads globally, of which 9,576 are in military stockpiles ready for potential use, up 86 on a year ago. The rise brings to an end the period of gradual decline that followed the end of the cold war. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) suggested 60 of the new warheads were held by China. The other new weapons are attributed to Russia (12), Pakistan (five), North Korea (five) and India (four). The increase in battle-fit warheads comes despite a statement in 2021 from the UN’s five permanent security council members – the US, Russia, China, the UK and France – that “nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all the nuclear weapons globally. In addition to their usable nuclear weapons, the two powers each hold more than 1,000 warheads previously retired from military service, which they are gradually dismantling. Of the total of 12,512 warheads in the world, which includes those that are retired and awaiting dismantlement, Sipri estimates that 3,844 are deployed with missiles and aircraft. Around 2,000 of those – nearly all of which belong to Russia or the US – are kept in a state of high operational alert, meaning that they are fitted to missiles or held at airbases hosting nuclear bombers. Sipri notes, however, that the full picture is difficult to judge as a number of countries, including Russia, the US and the UK, have reduced their level of transparency since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China, the world’s third biggest nuclear power, is believed to have increased its number of warheads from 350 in January 2022 to 410 in January 2023. That arsenal is expected to keep growing but Sipri predicts it they will not surpass the arsenals of the US and Russia. The report adds that China has never declared the size of its nuclear arsenal and that many of its assessments rely on data from the US Department of Defense (DOD). In 2021, commercial satellite imagery revealed that China had started construction of hundreds of new missile silos across the north of its territory. Hans M Kristensen, an associate senior fellow with Sipri’s weapons of mass destruction programme, said: “China has started a significant expansion of its nuclear arsenal. It is increasingly difficult to square this trend with China’s declared aim of having only the minimum nuclear forces needed to maintain its national security.” France (290) and the UK (225) are the world’s next largest nuclear powers and British operational arsenal is expected to grow further following an announcement two years ago that it was raising its limit from 225 to 260 warheads. Of the 225 UK warheads, 120 of are said to be operationally available for delivery by Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with about 40 being carried on a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) that is on patrol at all times. The UK government has said, however, that it will no longer publicly disclose its quantities of nuclear weapons, deployed warheads or deployed missiles amid increased global tensions. The new British policy is just one sign of a breakdown in cooperation over the future of nuclear weapons. The US suspended its bilateral strategic stability dialogue with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin announced it was suspending its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty limiting the strategic nuclear forces of the two cold war foes. Meanwhile, Russia’s government has increasingly spoken of the risk of nuclear war since its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Putin has said that he has put Russia’s nuclear deterrent on high alert. He also said in the immediate wake of his invasion that the consequences for those who stood in his country’s way would be “such as you have never seen in your entire history”. Since then, Nato’s arming of Ukraine’s military has provoked a constant stream of nuclear threats from figures close to the Kremlin. Dan Smith, a director at Sipri, said: “We are drifting into one of the most dangerous periods in human history. It is imperative that the world’s governments find ways to cooperate in order to calm geopolitical tensions, slow arms races and deal with the worsening consequences of environmental breakdown and rising world hunger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/04/coalition-mps-grassroots-nuclear-power-survey-linked-to-consulting-firm","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-03T19:00:04Z","webTitle":"Coalition MP’s ‘grassroots’ nuclear power survey linked to consulting firm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/04/coalition-mps-grassroots-nuclear-power-survey-linked-to-consulting-firm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/04/coalition-mps-grassroots-nuclear-power-survey-linked-to-consulting-firm","fields":{"bodyText":"A Coalition frontbencher conducting a “grassroots” survey about nuclear power is using a website registered by a business that helps an American small modular reactor company, records reveal. Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was “launching a grassroots community engagement program” under the banner “Time to Talk Nuclear”. He urged Australians to “join the conversation” by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: “What do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?” Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include “supporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technology”. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. Helixos says on its own website that NuScale Power “is reinventing nuclear energy and Helixos is helping them bring it to market”. It adds: “Helixos also provides training for employees to become technology ambassadors and engage with stakeholders and the public.” A search of domain records for O’Brien’s website shows the contact name for the domain registration is Lenka Kollar, a nuclear engineer who co-founded Helixos in 2020. She previously held the role of director of strategy and external relations for NuScale Power. In that previous role, Kollar was “working to bring NuScale’s small modular reactor to market through business plan development and clean energy outreach”, according to a profile published in 2017. Kollar addressed a Global Uranium Conference in Adelaide last month on the topic “reaching net zero with nuclear energy”. In tweets summarising her speech, Kollar said: “The time is now for Australians to have a conversation on nuclear energy and potentially overturn the ban.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is understood O’Brien engaged Helixos – which also does design work – as a contractor to support the development of the website. As part of designing the website it also registered the domain name. A source close to the matter said O’Brien’s team had sought out Helixos, believing it was ideal for the job because of its familiarity with the topic of nuclear energy. But the source said O’Brien had come up with the idea of the survey and the questions, and paid for the work himself. In a written response, O’Brien said the purpose of the survey and the use of collected data had “all been openly and accurately communicated”. “I’m personally paying for the grassroots community campaign ‘Time to Talk Nuclear’ out of my own back pocket because I think it’s an important conversation to have with the Australian people,” O’Brien said. “As we assess the prospect for nuclear energy moving forward, I will continue to seek assistance from people who are experts in the field.” The vice-president of marketing and communications for NuScale Power, Diane Hughes, said: “Helixos does in fact provide services for NuScale Power. “However, outside of providing an example image of our small modular reactor technology, NuScale does not have any involvement in the website, survey, nor outreach on advanced nuclear technologies being conducted by Mr O’Brien.” Helixos and Kollar were also contacted for comment. Helixos describes itself as a business that works “at the intersection of strategy consulting and technical advisory, specialising in cleantech commercialisation” and says it acts in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Helixos’s projects are listed openly on its own website. It works with the Energy Policy Institute of Australia “on editing public policy papers to promote progressive, technology-inclusive energy policy”, including one focusing on “the ability of small modular reactors (SMRs) to support a ‘just transition’ for coal communities in Australia”. Helixos states it worked with SMR Nuclear Technology Pty Ltd “to develop a proactive stakeholder engagement strategy” to “help achieve the main goal of having nuclear energy considered as part of Australia’s future energy mix”. Robert Pritchard, who is both chair of SMR Nuclear Technology and executive director of the Energy Policy Institute of Australia, declined to comment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech that the Coalition wanted “an intelligent conversation on the role that these new-age nuclear technologies might or might not be able to play” in Australia. Announcing the “grassroots community engagement program” on Friday, O’Brien said the starting point would be “an online survey that will open a two-way conversation with the Australian public about the benefits and concerns of advanced nuclear technology becoming part of Australia’s future energy mix”. “Other countries are reducing their emissions while keeping costs down and their network secure with nuclear energy,” O’Brien said. “The question is - should we? Together with the Australian people, let’s find out.” The survey has only three mandatory questions, starting with views on the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia. It then asks what concerns, if any, the participant holds about nuclear energy, followed by any questions they might have. There is an optional section to “stay informed” by submitting an email address and postcode to O’Brien’s team. O’Brien’s website also sets out frequently asked questions such as: “Is nuclear energy clean?” The answer states: “Yes! Nuclear power’s total life-cycle carbon emissions and raw material requirements are the lowest among other energy sources, even lower than wind and solar.” The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously accused the Coalition of pushing the nuclear debate as a “rearguard attempt to undermine and deny the transition to renewables”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/29/young-climate-activist-tells-greenpeace-to-drop-old-fashioned-anti-nuclear-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-29T04:00:09Z","webTitle":"Young climate activist tells Greenpeace to drop ‘old-fashioned’ anti-nuclear stance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/29/young-climate-activist-tells-greenpeace-to-drop-old-fashioned-anti-nuclear-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/29/young-climate-activist-tells-greenpeace-to-drop-old-fashioned-anti-nuclear-stance","fields":{"bodyText":"An 18-year-old climate activist has called for Greenpeace to drop its “old-fashioned and unscientific” campaign against nuclear power in the EU. In April, the environmental campaign group announced it would appeal against the EU Commission’s decision to include nuclear power in its classification system for sustainable finance. This “taxonomy” is designed as a guide for private investors wanting to fund green projects, aiming to boost environmental investment. Ia Aanstoot, from Sweden, who for three years took part in the Friday school strikes movement started by Greta Thunberg, said Greenpeace’s legal challenge served fossil fuel interests instead of climate action. With campaigners from five other EU countries, Aanstoot has launched the Dear Greenpeace campaign, asking the NGO to “drop your old-fashioned and unscientific opposition to nuclear power, and join us in the fight against fossil fuels instead”. This week, Aanstoot submitted papers to the EU court of justice asking to become an “interested party” in the upcoming legal battle between the European Commission and Greenpeace. If the court approves the request, she and other pro-nuclear campaigners will be able to provide testimony in favour of nuclear power. Greenpeace has argued that the EU classification system is “greenwashing” that allows nuclear power plants to receive money that otherwise would have gone to renewables. Lawyers acting for the NGO have said nuclear energy causes “significant harm to the environment” so should not be included in the taxonomy. Aanstoot said: “Over a third of the clean energy in the EU is nuclear power, so Greenpeace’s motion to get rid of it is really harmful, I think. And I would definitely prefer to be working together with Greenpeace to get rid of fossil fuels. But when they are actively fighting such a large and useful tool like nuclear power, I don’t feel like I can work with them. “Greenpeace is stuck in the past fighting clean, carbon-free nuclear energy while the world is literally burning. We need to be using all the tools available to address climate change and nuclear is one of them. I’m tired of having to fight my fellow environmentalists about this when we should be fighting fossil fuels together.” She has joined with other young campaigners from Poland, Sweden, France, Finland and the Netherlands. One of these, Julia Galosh, a 22-year-old biologist, said: “I’ve protested opposite Greenpeace in horror as they campaigned to stop Germany’s nuclear reactors – something which led to much more demand for coal. Now they want to stop my home country of Poland from transitioning from coal to nuclear. Enough is enough.” Aanstoot thinks this is a generational issue, with younger environmentalists more keen on nuclear than those from older generations. She said: “I feel like a lot of the arguments [that] are used from Greenpeace and other older environmentalist … are very identity-based. It nearly feels like being anti-nuclear is a question of identity for these older environmentalists. These old issues are ones that nuclear has mostly moved past, and also the global situation has changed. In the 60s and 70s during the anti-nuclear protests, the climate crisis was not as much of a concern as it is today. “I feel like it’s just a matter of moving on with the times and the scientists have moved on – the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] now says that nuclear is a really important tool.” A Greenpeace EU spokesperson said: “We have the greatest respect for folks who are worried about the climate crisis and want to throw everything we have at the problem, but building new nuclear plants just isn’t a viable solution. The top priority is to cut carbon emissions as fast and, ideally, as cheaply as possible, and nuclear fails on both scores. The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. And the industry has no long-term solution for safely storing the radioactive waste that will remain dangerous for thousands of years. “The good news is that we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut emissions, and with modern storage tech, 100 percent renewable systems are perfectly possible. Encouraging investments into nuclear energy by including it in the EU taxonomy risks diverting funding away from renewables, home insulation and support for people hit by extreme weather. We don’t have the luxury of endless time and resources so we should focus them on the solutions with the best chance of delivering.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-09T18:08:43Z","webTitle":"Offsite power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant destroyed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/09/offsite-power-supply-to-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-destroyed","fields":{"bodyText":"A vital offsite electricity supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been destroyed by shelling and there is little likelihood a reliable supply will be re-established, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog chief has said. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said shelling had destroyed the switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant. The plant has supplied power to the nuclear facility each time its normal supply lines had been cut over the past three weeks. The thermal plant was also supplying the surrounding area, which was plunged into darkness. Local Ukrainian officials said work was under way to restore the connection, which has been cut multiple times this week. Grossi, who said he had been informed of the situation by IAEA representatives at the plant, called for an “immediate cessation of all shelling in the entire area”. “This is an unsustainable situation and is becoming increasingly precarious,” he said, without apportioning blame for the shelling. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling near Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine and within the perimeter of Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant, which has six reactors. The thermal supply has been cut and restored multiple times this week and Enerhodar, the nearby town, has suffered several complete blackouts. When the thermal supply has been cut the plant has relied on its only remaining operating reactor for the power needed for cooling and other safety functions. This method is designed to provide power only for a few hours at a time. Diesel generators are used as a last resort. The constant destruction of thermal power supply has led Ukraine to consider shutting down the remaining operating reactor, said Grossi. Ukraine “no longer [has] confidence in the restoration of offsite power”, he said. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for the nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said. Enerhodar’s mayor in exile, Dmytro Orlov, said on Friday that work was under way to fix the switchyard and restore the supply from the thermal plant to the town, most of which was still suffering a blackout. The development came as diplomats from Canada and Poland prepare to submit a draft resolution to be voted on by the IAEA’s board of governors, according to Reuters. The IAEA acts the international nuclear watchdog under the United Nations. The draft text, seen by Reuters, implores Russia to leave the power plant and for control over the plant to be given to the competent authorities within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. The text is expected to be passed, according to diplomats cited by Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T22:08:01Z","webTitle":"California’s last nuclear power plant gets $1bn funding to extend life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","fields":{"bodyText":"California’s last nuclear plant could get a new lease on life after the Biden administration announced the approval of up to $1.1bn in conditional funding on Monday. The grant funds may offer a path to keeping the ageing facility known as Diablo Canyon online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2025. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the plant has faced a spate of controversies over the decades, for its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines. Its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But concerns over the state’s ability to generate enough green energy to fill the gap left by the plant’s closure grew as the deadline neared. The state is far from finding a reliable and climate-conscious replacement for the energy produced by the plant. The largest single-source provider in the state generates more than 8% of California’s electricity, enough to supply more than 3 million residents. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. It’s an issue being grappled with in states across the US. The nuclear power industry’s 92 reactors generate more than half of the country’s virtually carbon-free electricity, but about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas. As part of its effort to fight the climate crisis, the Biden administration set aside these grant funds to keep struggling nuclear plants online. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has also been among those strongly advocating for extending the life of Diablo Canyon, thereby giving the state more time to complete its ambitious green energy transition. In September, the governor pushed state lawmakers to approve a $1bn loan to keep the facility running an additional five years. The federal funds – the terms of which are still being negotiated – would help cover operating costs and be doled out over the course of four years. Diablo Canyon still has obstacles to cross though, most significantly the need for a renewed license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Significant upgrades were needed to ensure the plant could continue to operate safely and sustainably. And there are still vocal critics of any plan to keep it open. “The danger of Diablo Canyon is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there’s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition,” said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate and clean energy program, who helped negotiated the plant’s decommission. Critics also highlight how the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste. Suzanne Hosn, a spokesperson for PG&amp;E, the utility company that operates the plant, said Diablo can “safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding”. Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes. Calling nuclear the “nation’s largest source of clean electricity”, US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, said the grant was a “critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power”. Biden has set a goal of decarbonizing the grid by 2035, and the administration is relying on nuclear energy to play a part. The grant is intended to ensure that plants like Diablo Canyon can stay afloat. “We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,” Granholm said.

At least three and up to five of that eight will be Virginia-class submarines it will buy from the United States. The “only actual promise” under Aukus is for Australia to build three nuclear powered submarines, Greens senator David Shoebridge said. It has been widely reported that all eight submarines will be SSN-Aukus boats built in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The misunderstanding appears to have crept in because, while successive governments have talked about acquiring eight submarines under the Aukus program, those submarines will not all be SSN-Aukus submarines. Vice admiral Jonathan Mead, the navy’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce chief, told estimates last week the government had “indicated eight nuclear powered submarines for Australia”. “Based on our modelling and working with our US and UK partners, we are looking to have a fleet of eight SSNs for the Royal Australian Navy in the mid-2050s,” he said. The Greens senator David Shoebridge then said: “Sorry, eight Aukus-SSN?” To which Mead replied: “No, eight nuclear powered submarines. That includes three of the Virginias.” The majority of reports on the Aukus submarine program refer to eight Aukus submarines, to be built in Australia. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has consistently referred to the Aukus plan to acquire a “fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines”, not SSN-Aukus submarines. He has said the threat of a capability gap as the existing Collins class submarines are retired and before the SSN-Aukus starts to roll out in the 2040s is why they arranged with the US to get the three Virginia class submarines. “But were those timelines to slip, there is the option to have four and then potentially five Virginias,” he has said. When Aukus was first announced by the former prime minister Scott Morrison, he promised to find the “optimal pathway” to deliver “at least eight submarines”. When the “optimal pathway” was announced in March, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described the SSN-Aukus as a “new, conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine, based on a British design and incorporating cutting edge Australian, UK and US technologies”. “This will be an Australian sovereign capability, built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australians in Australian shipyards, with construction to begin this decade,” he said, while describing the 20,000 jobs and increased skills set to flow from the project as well as the plan to buy Virginia submarines. The defence department’s guide to the optimal pathway mentions the possibility of up to five US boats, but no overall number for the SSN-Aukus. The US president, Joe Biden, said the SSN-Aukus would “feature cutting edge propulsion technology and provide unmatched stealth and manoeuvrability”. He confirmed the US would sell three Virginia-class submarines to Australia, “with the potential to sell up to two more if needed”. But “selling subs” was not the ultimate goal, he said. “It’s developing something new together. We’re calling it the SSN-Aukus.” The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the new submarine would be “one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known”. Shoebridge continued to question Mead in the May estimates about the number of SSN-Aukus submarines to be built. “The decision to go beyond eight nuclear powered submarines would be a question for a government in the future,” Mead said. The secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, said the government had been “very upfront” about deciding on five SSN-Aukus submarines. “But [defence minister Richard Marles] has also said that a future government will take a decision about acquiring additional SSN-Aukus,” he said. “In Mr Marles’s view, once we have that production line going, he thinks we will involve ourselves in a continual shipbuilding production run of SSNs in Adelaide.” The Australian Industry and Defence Network chief executive, Brent Clark, said a future government might decide to keep building submarines, but the timeframes are so long it starts to become a “flight of fantasy”. “We don’t know what a government in five election cycles will do … it may determine it doesn’t want a nuclear submarine at all. It may want underwater drones,” he said. That uncertainty made it difficult for industry to plan, he said, adding that the uncertainty had been increased by the defence strategic review emphasising speed and capability “trumping” Australian content. Shoebridge said he was surprised by Mead’s admission, but “nowhere near as surprised as workers” would be, and that it made the Aukus decision appear a “thought bubble”. “Labor’s promise that a future government might decide to build some more boats from 2060 is about as useful as flyscreen on a submarine,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-30T17:59:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia reducing its presence at nuclear power plant, says Ukraine; Pope says war seems to have ‘no end’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, said in an interview published on Friday. A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) has claimed. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. Overnight, the Russian army reportedly attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 Shahed drones were fired, and that air defence forces shot down 10 drones. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Speaking at a press conference, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has said the commission “will focus prudently on the windfall profits from the immobilised assets of the Russian central bank”. Belgium’s prime minister said earlier on Friday that the windfall profit from Russia’s frozen assets in Europe could provide $3.27bn (£2.57bn) a year to rebuild Ukraine. The Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces is making slow but steady progress, US army general Mark Milley said on Friday. “It’s going slower than people had predicted. Doesn’t surprise me,” Miley told an audience at the National Press Club. “It is advancing steadily, deliberately, working its way through very difficult minefields, etc.” The comments came after Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, told Ukrainian television on Friday: “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions. “In the south, we are moving with varying success. Sometimes there are days when it is more than a kilometre, sometimes less than a kilometre, sometimes up to 2 kilometres,” she said. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The award-winning Ukrainian writer and war crimes researcher Victoria Amelina was critically injured in a Russian missile strike on a pizza restaurant in eastern Ukraine this week. Human activists say the attack on the crowded building, which killed 12 people including 14-year-old twins and injured at least 60 others, was a war crime. The Ria Lounge was one of the most popular restaurants in Kramatorsk and was filled with civilians when it was hit on Tuesday evening. “There were no military objects that could have been a legal target for the attack around that day,” PEN Ukraine and the war crimes campaign group Truth Hounds said in a statement that confirmed Amelina was among injured people.

Ukraine hopes to use Spain’s rotating EU presidency to try to “gain influence” in Latin America, where several countries have opposed Kyiv’s efforts to retake territory occupied by Russia, President Zelenskiy told Spanish media. Speaking on Friday on the eve of a visit by Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, Zelenskiy said several unspecified countries had blocked an invitation extended to him by Sánchez to take part in an EU-Latin American summit in Brussels in mid-July, Reuters reports. “We have a peace formula, and Pedro has supported us a lot. He has a constant dialogue with Latin America and they listen to him, it’s a fact. But I’ll say frankly that some Latin American countries are blocking the decision and this invitation,” he said in comments from Kyiv aired by state broadcaster TVE. “I want them not only to join the peace formula, but to stand against war,” Ukraine’s president added. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine: Reuters has more on what was discussed during the telephone call with President Putin and Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister (See post at 14:02). The Indian government said Putin, who will also join Modi on Tuesday for a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, informed the prime minister about the recent developments in Russia during their conversation. “While discussing the situation in Ukraine, PM (Modi) reiterated his call for dialogue and diplomacy,” the government said in a statement. India remains dependent on Moscow for its defence needs and has sharply increased its imports of cheap Russian oil. An oligarch who made a fortune in Russia and is under Ukrainian sanctions has UK residency after being granted a special visa for rich people. Pavel Fuks, a Ukrainian national who had sanctions imposed upon him in 2021, is also under criminal investigation for fraud and tax evasion in his home country. But the Guardian has established that Fuks, known as a regular at an exclusive Mayfair restaurant, was granted a so-called golden visa in 2012, followed by indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2017. “It’s effective as of today,” his spokesperson said. All accusations against Fuks in Ukraine “are exclusively political and are not confirmed by court decisions,” the spokesperson said, adding that his lawyers “are challenging the sanctions and charges in court”. Fuks says the sanctions are legally flawed.

The US has information indicating Mali’s transition government has paid more than $200m (£157m) to Wagner since late 2021, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Ukraine’s military commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, told the Washington Post he was frustrated by the slow deliveries of promised weaponry from the west. A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis reportedly said on Friday there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (Gur) has claimed, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency’s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson. Overnight, the Russian army reportedly attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region.

Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has blocked media outlets linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the Wagner mercenary group which staged a brief mutiny last Saturday, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Friday. Last Saturday, Russia appeared to have averted an immediate descent into civil war after Prigozhin said he would order his Wagner fighters to end their march on Moscow and return to their bases in southern Russia. Drone strikes hit an airbase in eastern Libya used by mercenaries of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner early on Friday without causing any casualties, a military official told AFP. AFP reports: The origin of the overnight strikes on the Al-Kharruba airbase, about 90 miles southwest of Benghazi, was “unknown”, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The base that was hit is “where members of the Wagner group are located”, the official said, adding there were “no victims”. Reports carried by Libyan and Arab news websites claimed that the strikes had been launched from aircraft that belong to the UN-recognised government in divided Libya. But the government of National Unity based in the capital Tripoli denied any involvement. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, said in an interview published on Friday. Zaluzhny told the Washington Post he was frustrated by the slow deliveries of promised weaponry from the west. It “pisses me off” that some in the west complain about the slow start and progress to the push against Russian occupying forces in the country’s south, he said. Zaluzhny said his western supporters would not themselves launch an offensive without air superiority, but Ukraine was still awaiting F-16 fighters promised by its allies. “I do not need 120 planes. I’m not going to threaten the whole world. A very limited number would be enough,” he told the newspaper. “But they are needed. Because there is no other way. Because the enemy is using a different generation of aviation,” Zaluzhny said, adding that he had a fraction of the artillery shells that Russia was firing, the Washington Post reported. A teacher and another employee of a school in Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. It posted to its official Telegram channel: Russian troops shelled a school in the village of Serhiivka in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk region: a teacher and the chief accountant were killed, and six other employees were injured. At the time of the shelling, there were 12 employees at the school. Part of the building is completely destroyed. The post was accompanied by images that showed officials inspecting the damage. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s parliament voted on Friday to return tax rates from the start of August to levels they were at before Russia’s invasion. The move is aimed at boosting budget revenues and complying with an International Monetary Fund lending program, Reuters reports. The government introduced tax cuts and other economic measures soon after Russia’s 24 February 2022 invasion to help businesses weather the disruption caused by the war. Ukraine depends heavily on foreign aid to finance its budget spending this year as the war is severely affecting the economy. Scrapping tax privileges and boosting budget revenues are vital conditions under the IMF’s $15.6bn (£12.3bn) lending programme. In Kramatorsk today, a funeral has been held for the 14-year-old twins Anna and Yuliia Aksenchenko who were among 12 people who were killed when a Russian missile hit a pizza restaurant in the eastern city on Tuesday evening. At the ceremony, a crowd of about 30 relatives, friends and local residents gathered to pay their respects. Max Hunder was there for Reuters, and described the scene, saying that the mother of the twins looked completely drained of vitality as she sat by the graves of her daughters. None of the family members were in any condition to speak to reporters, the girls’ godfather said. The girls lay in coffins with open caskets, but were covered with a glistening white and gold sheet. Mourners said the girls had been dressed in wedding dresses for their burial, a custom in Ukraine for girls who die too young to marry. Initially unable to find two wedding dresses in a city not far from the front and where wedding parlours are closed, friends and family issued an online appeal for well-wishers to donate two dresses so that the girls could be buried. “This is a tradition. If girls become angels, go up to heaven before getting married, they are dressed in wedding dresses so they can find their other half there,” said Viktoria Kushka, 50, a teacher who taught Anna and Yuliia in first grade. Speaking in one of the classrooms at the nearby school where the girls studied, Kushka recalled her memories of the girls, saying: “They were two little sunshines. Smiling, big light blue eyes. Always together, always supporting each other.” In a telephone call on Friday with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin discussed the situation around Ukraine and how Moscow had resolved an armed mercenary mutiny, the Kremlin said. It said that Modi had expressed support for what the Kremlin called the Russian leadership’s decisive actions in handling the mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group last Saturday, Reuters reports. The Russian rouble tumbled past 89 against the dollar for the first time in more than 15 months on Friday, Reuters reports. Bank of Russia deputy governor Alexei Zabotkin said reduced export revenues and the balance of payments were determining the rouble’s weakening, which he said carried no risks to financial stability. Moscow has said the Wagner mercenary group, which recently attempted a short-lived mutiny in Russia, would continue to work in Africa if governments on the continent decided to maintain contracts with the private military group, AFP reports. “The future of the agreements between African countries and the Wagner private military company is above all up to the governments of the countries concerned,” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told reporters during a briefing. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, ordered top military commanders on Friday to strengthen Ukraine’s northern military sector following the arrival of Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russian Wagner mercenary group, in Belarus. “The decision... is for commander-in-chief (Valeriy) Zaluzhnyi and ‘North’ commander (Serhiy) Naev to implement a set of measures to strengthen this direction,” Zelenskiy said on Telegram. He said government and military leaders had also heard a report from Ukrainian intelligence and security forces on the situation in Belarus, Ukraine’s northern neighbour, Reuters reports. On Thursday, satellite images emerged of a military base south-east of the Belarus capital, Minsk, that appeared to show new facilities set up in recent days, suggesting the swift construction of a base for Wagner. Russian media have reported that Wagner, whose leader, Prigozhin, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday, could set up a new base at a vacant military facility near the town of Osipovichi, about 50 miles (90km) from Minsk. Pope Francis said on Friday there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow, Reuters reports. “The tragic reality of this war that seems to have no end demands of everyone a common creative effort to imagine and forge paths of peace,” the pope told a religious delegation from the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Vatican said in a subsequent statement that the pope’s envoy, Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, had finished his consultations in Moscow, where he had met Yuri Ushakov, one of President Putin’s advisers, and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. “(The visit was) aimed at identifying humanitarian initiatives, which could open roads to peace,” the statement said. Francis has repeatedly called for an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In May, President Zelenskiy asked Francis to back Kyiv’s peace plan, and the pope indicated the Vatican would help in the repatriation of Ukrainian children taken by Russians. The World Bank has approved a $1.5bn loan to Ukraine to support the country’s development and reconstruction policies, according to the organisation’s press service. The loan, as reported on by the Kyiv Post, will be used to ensure transparency in the use of public funds and to strengthen the social security system. Kazakhstan has announced it has uncovered online efforts to recruit its citizens to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, AFP reports. The warning from regional officials in the Kremlin-friendly country late on Thursday follows reports in local media that Kazakhstan citizens have been killed in Ukraine. Both the Russian military and the Wagner mercenary group have targeted citizens of the ex-Soviet country in central Asia to join their ranks. Prosecutors in the northern Kostanay region, which borders Russia and is home to a large Russian minority, warned residents not to “succumb” to attempts on social media to enlist men into Moscow’s forces. The region is home to about 880,000 people, 41% of whom are ethnic Russians, government figures show. “On the territory of our region, attempts were made to recruit the local population to the territory of the Russian Federation in order to participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine,” the region’s prosecutor’s office said in a statement. Wimbledon has banned its merchandise from being sold in Russia and Belarus as part of its ongoing condemnation of the war in Ukraine. The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) has said it will not allow any of its products to be shipped to the two countries due to Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion. An AELTC spokesperson said: We continue to totally condemn Russia’s illegal invasion and our wholehearted support remains with the people of Ukraine. We will donate £1 for each ticket-holder attending the championships to the British Red Cross Ukraine relief efforts, which will result in a contribution of more than half a million pounds. We will also welcome 1,000 refugees to join us for a day at Wimbledon, with their food and transport provided. We are maintaining the ban on broadcasting the championships in Russia and Belarus, as well as the ban on Wimbledon merchandise being sold and shipped to both countries. You can read the full story from my colleague Emine Sinmaz below: More information has come in about the ice hockey player from Poland’s major league who has apparently been charged with spying for Russia (See post at 09:38). The man, a Russian citizen, was reportedly arrested on 11 June in Silesia, southern Poland, and is believed to be part of a Russian spy ring. According to the national prosecutor’s office, the detained man is the 14th person arrested as part of an investigation into a “spy ring collaborating with Russian special services”. “The suspects, identified as foreigners from across the eastern border, carried out intelligence as well as propaganda activities against Poland,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. Among their activities were “monitoring of railway routes” and spreading “propaganda against Nato, Poland and the Polish government’s policy”, it said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow had demanded an explanation from Poland over its arrest of Russian citizens, state news agency RIA reported. Russia is scaling back its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plower plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) warned on Friday, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency’s chief, Kyrlo Budanov, has said that Moscow approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russians were plotting a “terrorist attack”. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom have been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. The intelligence agency named three senior individuals who had already departed: the plant’s chief inspector, the head of the legal department, and the deputy in charge of supplies. It said the number of Russian soldiers at the station and in the nearby town of Enerhodar had reduced. Since seizing the plant last year, the Russian army has turned it into a full-blown military base. It moved hardware into the turbine halls including armoured vehicles and ammunition. Soldiers used the territory to bombard Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. This has mostly dried up after the Kakhovka dam downstream was blown up earlier this month. Western governments and Kyiv say Russia deliberately sabotaged the dam in order to impede Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Former plant workers said it would be difficult to damage the reactors, which were protected by thick steel and concrete. But they said the small cooling pond – which the Russians have allegedly mined – was more vulnerable, as was a dry storage area used for spent nuclear fuel. An explosion in the cooling pond could lead to a partial nuclear meltdown similar to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US state of Pennsylvania, said Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer. In this scenario, most radiation would be contained. But he added: “Of course, if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels this would throw out radiation.” Kovynyev said the dry storage area at the plant contained 24 spent “fuel assemblies”, sealed in 120 “hermetic” thick steel casks. “In a normal situation they are absolutely safe. [But] if you wanted, you could destroy them. You could shell several times. This could cause a nuclear accident with radiation release.” He said he remained “optimistic” that no disaster would take place. Before the full-scale invasion, the plant employed 11,500 workers. An estimated 2,500 remain. Some, including the plant’s Ukrainian director, have signed contracts with Rosatom. Others have refused and have had their security passes revoked. Staff receive salaries from Russia as well as Ukraine. The GUR said on Friday that personnel remaining at the station had been instructed to “blame Ukraine in case of any emergencies”. Russia has claimed that Kyiv has endangered the station by shelling it. Ukraine has urged the international community to pay attention to the alarming situation at the plant and to put pressure on Moscow to step back from the brink. Officials point out that Zelenskiy warned last year that the Kremlin was preparing to blow up the Kakhovka dam – something that happened seven months later. The chief rabbi of Ukraine, Moshe Azman, urged the “entire world community” to do everything in its power to stop a possible catastrophe. This week Russia told the UN security council it had no plans to blow up the plant. It previously assured the council it would not invade Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors on Friday charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson. Reuters reports: They are the first suspects to be charged by Ukraine, which says more than 19,000 children have been illegally transferred to Russia or Russian-held territory, officials told Reuters. The charges brought by Ukraine’s prosecutors follow a wider investigation carried out in cooperation with The Hague-based international criminal court, the chief prosecutor of which visited the Kherson Children’s Home. On Friday, the charges were filed in Ukraine, a pre-trial stage when prosecutors determine [whether] there is sufficient evidence to suspect a person of committing a criminal offence. The ICC, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal, issued an arrest warrant in March against Russian president Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from orphanages and children’s homes in Russian-occupied Ukraine. The Kremlin on Wednesday again dismissed allegations that Russia had violated children’s rights in Ukraine and said that, on the contrary, its armed forces were rescuing children from conflict zones. Prosecution documents seen by Reuters allege that 48 orphans were taken from the Kherson regional children’s home in September and October and relocated to Moscow and Russian-occupied Crimea. If proven, this is a violation of the laws and customs of war under the 1949 Geneva conventions, and punishable by up 12 years in prison under Ukrainian law, the document seen by Reuters said. The current whereabouts of the orphans, ranging from one to four years old, is uncertain, prosecutors said. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow will emerge from the aftermath of a recent armed insurrection by the Wagner mercenary group “stronger” than before, AFP reports. “Russia has always overcome all its problems... it comes out stronger and stronger. It will be the same this time, too. This process has already begun,” Lavrov told journalists during a briefing in Moscow, after the rebels marched on the capital last week to oust the country’s military leadership. The revolt, led by mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, posed the most serious threat to Vladimir Putin’s decades-long rule and spurred Kremlin efforts to disband the private military outfit. Answering a question from foreign media, Lavrov said: “thank you for your concern about our national interests, but you shouldn’t be worried”. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that the ciuntry’s troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, told Ukrainian television. Russia is gradually reducing its personnel numbers at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. The GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. It said Ukrainian employees who had signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and have been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula. Overnight, the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, and that air defence forces shot down 10 drones. Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Local Russian-imposed officials said that air defence had repelled the attack. Video distributed on social media appeared to show smoke rising over the occupied city. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up displaying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday that he believed the west was aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. He also accused the west of having a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. Lavrov also described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, after reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay a ratification of the membership. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. Poland has detained a Russian ice hockey athlete, who plays for a first division Polish team, on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday, describing him as the 14th person to be arrested from one espionage network. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has accused Ukraine of committing war crimes by stationing troops and military equipment in civilian areas. He denied on Friday that Russia’s armed forces intentionally attacked civilian targets in Ukraine, saying they only targeted military infrastructure or other military targets. Speaking at a news conference, Reuters reports that Lavrov accused Ukraine of deploying troops and heavy weapons to civilian infrastructure such as in schools and apartment buildings. He said such tactics were war crimes. Russia staged its latest invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since that time, the UN has recorded more than 19,000 casualties, including 6,000 deaths, among the civilian population of Ukraine in areas controlled by the Kyiv government. Earlier this week, 12 people, including four children, were killed when a Russian missile hit a restaurant in Kramatorsk. An eight-month-old baby was among the wounded. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been giving a wide-ranging press briefing this morning. He says he believes the west is aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. This accusation mirrors a frequent talking point from Ukrainian officials – a fear that peace talks or a stalemate on the ground would give Russia time to re-equip for a renewed push into the county. Reuters reports Lavrov accused western countries of taking a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. On the topic of the forced deportation of children, which the international criminal court has accused Russia of carrying out, Lavrov said Russia had evacuated children from orphanages in war zones. The Ukrainian government says it has identified more than 19,000 children whom it claims have been unlawfully deported or otherwise separated from their parents or guardians. He also accused the west of hypocrisy for attacking Russia over its alleged human rights abuses in Ukraine while, in his view, ignoring what he described as “racist” statements by Ukrainian authorities about killing Russians. Suspilne reports that Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that earlier today it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Unverified social media footage showed smoke rising in the sky above the occupied city earlier. Russian sources say that air defences repelled the attack. The claims have not been independently verified. A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that its troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. Since the start of its counteroffensive, Ukraine says it has reasserted control over clusters of villages in the south-east although Russia still holds swathes of territory in the east, south and south-east. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, told Ukrainian television, Reuters reports. Poland has detained a Russian ice hockey athlete, who plays for a first division Polish team, on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday. They described him as the 14th person to be arrested from one espionage network. “Russian spies are falling in one by one!” wrote justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro on Twitter, Reuters reports. “A spy who acted under the guise of an athlete was caught. The Russian was a player of a first division club.” The hockey player was taken into custody in the southern Polish region of Silesia, prosecutors said in a statement. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Moscow has again been threatening not to extend the deal. It says there are obstacles to exporting its own agricultural products which need to be removed. These include financial sanctions on the banking and insurance sectors, and the reopening of an ammonia pipeline that would allow Russia to export ammonia via Ukraine’s port of Odesa, a city frequently targeted by Russian missile strikes. Speaking in a news briefing, Lavrov also called for an expansion in the membership of the UN security council to give more representation to Asian, African and Latin American countries. “A majority of the world does not want to live according to western rules,” Reuters quotes him saying. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday that his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, following reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay ratification of Sweden’s membership. “I spoke to Viktor Orbán yesterday and he confirmed very clearly that what he said to me last time still applies,” Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson said on Friday. “Hungary will not delay Sweden’s ratification process in any way,” he told the media. Reuters reports Kristersson did not specify whether Orban’s comments implied a vote could take place before the Nato summit in Vilnius. Russia is gradually reducing the number of personnel at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. “According to the latest data, the occupation contingent is gradually leaving the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” the main directorate of intelligence at the defence ministry (GUR) said on the Telegram messaging app. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian employees who had signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and had been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula, which Russia illegally seized from Ukraine in 2014. GUR said the number of military patrols was also gradually decreasing on the plant’s vast territory and in the nearby city of Enerhodar, and that personnel remaining at the plant had been told to blame Ukraine “in case of any emergency situations”. Russian authorities declined to comment on the claims when approached by Reuters. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the plant and its vicinity. Russia has occupied the plant since March 2022, and Kyiv accused Russia this month of planning a “terrorist” attack at the nuclear plant involving the release of radiation, an accusation which Russia has dismissed. Unverified video footage being shared on social media appears to show explosions in Berdiansk. On the Telegram messaging app, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, shared the clip with this message: According to preliminary data, the Ukrainian armed forces militants tried to strike this morning with Storm Shadow missiles. The series of explosions heard is the result of the work of the Russian air defence, which successfully repelled an enemy attack on civilians on the outskirts of the city. The location and time the video clip was taken has not been verified by the Guardian. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up carrying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia claimed the strike was on a military target. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this roundup of overnight news from across Ukraine: At night, the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region: four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, air defence forces shot down 10 drones, the air force reported. No people were injured in the night attack in Zaporizhzhia. In Mykolaiv a fire broke out due to the fall of fragments of downed drones, and there were no injuries. In the Lozova district of the Kharkiv region, a 13-year-old boy found an unknown explosive device in his own yard; he was hospitalised with a traumatic amputation of the fingers of his left hand, the state emergency service reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. “One thing is clear, we Hungarians … will not give more money to Ukraine until they say where the previous around €70bn worth of funds had gone,” Orban said. “And we find it utterly ridiculous and absurd that we should contribute more money to finance debt service costs of a loan from which we have still not received the funds we are entitled to get.” Orbán was speaking on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels. Budapest – along with Poland – has not received funds from the EU’s recovery fund amid a rule of law dispute. Reuters reports that on Thursday, EU leaders declared they would make long-term commitments to bolster Ukraine’s security as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged them to start work on a new round of sanctions against Russia. Orbán said there was almost no chance that EU member states would approve these financial plans and that a “long fight” would start. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. It writes: Using a Russian phone number, we called more than a dozen recruitment centres saying, if asked, that we were inquiring on behalf of a brother. All those who replied confirmed that it was business as usual. From Kaliningrad in the west to Krasnodar in the south, no one believed the group was being disbanded. Several people who picked up the phone stressed that new members were signing contracts with the mercenary group itself, not the Russian defence ministry. “We are working. If something had changed, they’d have told us. But there’s nothing,” a female recruiter in Krasnodar, southern Russia, was clear. In Volgograd, the man we spoke to said that if someone signed up today, “I could deploy him tomorrow,” and confirmed that Belarus was now a possible destination. Sarah Rainsford, who compiled the report for the BBC, pointed out on Twitter the contrast between the treatment of the armed insurrectionist group Wagner and those who have peacefully opposed Russia’s president. The sound of explosions has been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Berdiansk. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carrying a statement from a local Russian-imposed authority saying that at 8am Moscow time (6am BST): “According to preliminary information, the air defence system of the Russian Federation armed forces went off.” Citing regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin, Suspilne reports that two people – a 72-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man – have been injured this morning by Russian shelling in the region. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Nato is nearing consensus on how to address Ukraine’s membership push at its coming summit and aims to show it is moving “above and beyond” an earlier vow to Kyiv, the US envoy to Nato has said. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv, backed by Nato allies in eastern Europe, has called for a commitment at the gathering in Lithuania in two weeks that it will join the military alliance when the war with Russia ends. Diplomats at Nato say the US has been reluctant to move beyond a 2008 pledge made in Bucharest that promised Ukraine would become a member but did not set a timeline. Nato’s 31 member countries are haggling over the exact wording on Ukraine’s potential membership for a final communique at the summit. The US ambassador to Nato, Julianne Smith, said on Thursday that the final version could begin to answer how Ukraine would eventually become an alliance member. I think most of us feel confident that we are going to be able to come to an agreement that will reflect where we are and that the Ukrainians will believe and feel is something above and beyond restating Bucharest. Smith said the alliance was getting closer to finding a consensus on the language but that she did not want to preempt the final phrasing. Spain will take on the EU’s rotating presidency on Saturday with the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, visiting Kyiv to show steadfast European support for Ukraine as it battles Russian forces, his office has said. The announcement was made as Sanchez attended an EU summit in Brussels, in which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, participating via video link, confirmed the visit, Agence France-Presse reports. Spain will hold the EU presidency from July to the end of December, taking over from Sweden. The role puts ministers from the EU presidency country in the chair of most EU meetings, influencing the agenda and priorities of topics being decided. Zelenskiy told the summit that Sanchez’s visit “says much about the importance … for our Europe and the membership candidacy of Ukraine for the EU”. EU leaders declared they would make long-term commitments to bolster Ukraine’s security as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged them to start work on a new round of sanctions against Russia. Reuters reports that at a summit in Brussels, the leaders restated their condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and said the EU and its member countries “stand ready” to contribute to commitments that would help Ukraine defend itself in the long term. In a text summarising the summit’s conclusions, the leaders said on Thursday they would swiftly consider the form those commitments would take. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, suggested they could build on existing EU support, such as the European Peace Facility fund that has financed billions of euros in arms for Ukraine and a training mission for Ukrainian troops. “The military support to Ukraine has to [be for the] long haul,” Borrell said. Greta Thunberg has denounced the ecological havoc caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the lack of international reaction to the disaster. “Ecocide and environmental destruction is a form of warfare … as Ukrainians by this point know all too well – and so does Russia,” the Swedish climate activist said on Thursday during a visit to Kyiv as part of an international delegation investigating the environmental consequences of the conflict. And that’s why they are deliberately targeting the environment and people’s livelihoods and homes and therefore also destroying lives. Thunberg was speaking at a news conference along with Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yerma, Agence France-Presse also reports. She and the rest of the delegation met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the southern region of Kherson on 6 June caused disastrous flooding, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands of others to flee. Zelensky has criticised what he says is an inadequate international response to the disaster. A senior Czech official has labelled Russia a “direct military threat” to the Czech Republic and its eastern Nato allies as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued. Martin Povejsil, head of the Czech foreign ministry’s security department, said it was “impossible to rule out a direct military threat [from Russia] in the foreseeable future”. Agence France-Presse reports he was commenting on a new security strategy approved by the Czech government the previous day and designed to raise awareness of the security situation among the Czech public. “We can see how agendas that were until recently perceived as free of security aspects are gradually taking security into account,” Povejsil said on Thursday, naming science and research – prone to cyber-attacks and espionage – as an example. The security strategy says the Czech Republic should get ready “for the possibility that it could become part of an armed conflict”. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Yuriy Malashko, governor of the southern Ukrainian region that includes the plant, said the drills in Zaporizhzhia city and the district around it were intended to coordinate the response of all services to an “emergency situation” at the plant, Reuters reports. Ukraine accused Russia this month of planning a “terrorist” attack at the plant involving the release of radiation. Moscow denied the accusation. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Thursday that he wrote to the UN security council and the secretary general, António Guterres, to say: We do not intend to blow up this NPP [nuclear power plant] we have no intention of doing so. Reuters television footage showed rescuers in protective gear and gas masks using dosimeters to check passenger cars and trucks for radiation levels and then cleaning wheels before vehicles underwent additional decontamination at specialised washing points. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to multiple news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Cluster munitions are bombs containing smaller bomblets that scatter as they drop from the air, causing wider damage. US officials said the decision from the White House was expected soon, CNN reported, while NBC News said it could come as early as next month. Politico reported that late last year the Biden administration said it had “concerns” about delivering the munitions to Ukraine, mainly for humanitarian reasons and also because the US didn’t assess Ukraine as needing them at that point. In other news: Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. He said that a few days before the attempted rebellion, Russia’s defence ministry announced that all groups performing combat missions must sign a contract with the ministry, Russian state news agency Tass reported. Prigozhin did not sign the contracts and was informed that Wagner would not take part in what the Kremlin calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine, according to Kartapolov, who added: “That is, funding, material resources will not be allocated.” The Kremlin has declined to answer questions about the whereabouts of Sergei Surovikin amid unconfirmed reports that the Russian army general had been detained and was being questioned by the security services. US intelligence has claimed that Surovikin, who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine, had prior knowledge of Prigozhin’s uprising, in which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and moved on Moscow before striking an amnesty deal. Surovikin has not been seen in public since last Saturday. Former US President Donald Trump has said now is the time for the US to try to broker a negotiated peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine and that Vladimir Putin has been “somewhat weakened” by Wagner’s aborted mutiny. “I want people to stop dying over this ridiculous war,” Trump told Reuters in an interview. Trump said everything would be “subject to negotiation” if he were president. Ukrainian forces are advancing “slowly but surely” on the frontlines in the east and south-east of the country as well as around the longstanding flashpoint of Bakhmut, senior military officials have said. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi told the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, that his forces had “succeeded in seizing the strategic initiative”. Ukrainian forces had made advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns, Berdiansk and Mariupol, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister said. “Every day, there is an advance,” Hanna Maliar said on national television. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” Mike Pence met Volodymyr Zelenskiy during surprise Ukraine trip. Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet the Ukrainian president during the US campaign. Pence told NBC News: “Coming here just as a private citizen … just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” Russia has ruled out Switzerland as location for peace talks, saying it had “lost its status as a neutral state” after supporting EU sanctions. Russia’s ambassador to Switzerland said Moscow could not accept any Swiss-hosted peace summit on Ukraine after it joined EU sanctions against his country, adding that Switzerland had lost its reputation for neutrality. The EU is considering imposing a levy on interest made from frozen Russian cash that could raise about €3bn ($3.3bn, £2.6bn) a year to help Ukraine’s recovery from the war. A “windfall contribution” was to be discussed by EU leaders at a current European Council summit in an attempt to harness the value of sovereign Russian funds immobilised by sanctions. The death toll in a Russian rocket attack on a pizza restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk has risen to 12, including four children. Ukraine’s state emergency service said at least 56 people were injured, some critically, when two Iskander missiles were fired into the restaurant in the city centre on Tuesday evening. The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said rescue attempts had ended. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it killed two Ukrainian generals and up to 50 officers in a missile strike when referring to this attack. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency has arrested a local man it accused of helping the Russians carry out the attack on Kramatorsk. The SBU said it had arrested an employee of a gas transportation company who helped coordinate the strike and allegedly sent video footage of the cafe to the Russian military. It provided no evidence for the claims. The Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Kherson region has denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridgehead over the Dnipro River at the location of the Antonivskyi Bridge. Vladimir Saldo also claimed Russian forces had repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. The Israeli prime minister said he had rejected calls from Washington and Kyiv to arm Ukraine due to “concerns that I don’t think any of the western allies of Ukraine have”. Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that Israel needed “freedom of action” in Syria, where Israel often bombs Iranian targets near Russian forces. He said he also had fears that Israeli weaponry could be captured in Ukraine and turned over to Iran. Hungary’s vote on Sweden joining Nato has again been delayed, with the Hungarian parliament’s house committee rejecting a proposal to schedule the vote on the ratification of Sweden’s membership for next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T17:43:12Z","webTitle":"Ineos in talks with Rolls-Royce on mini-nuclear power plant technology ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","fields":{"bodyText":"Ineos, the chemicals company owned by the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has held exploratory talks with Rolls-Royce on nuclear technology that could eventually be chosen to provide zero-carbon energy to the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. A deal between Ineos, one of the UK’s biggest privately owned companies, and FTSE 100 engineer Rolls-Royce could help Ineos with the tricky task of decarbonising the giant refinery, while also providing Rolls-Royce with an early customer for a new technology it hopes will transform its prospects. Rolls-Royce’s main business is building and maintaining jet engines for commercial aeroplanes, as well as power systems for boats and land vehicles. However, it is one of a handful of companies around the world hoping to use the expertise gained from building nuclear reactors for the UK’s submarine fleet for use on land. Ineos, which produces fuel and the chemicals used in plastics, is planning to use hydrogen to power the Grangemouth plant, which employs about 2,000 people across nearly 700 hectares (1,700 acres) of land. However, creating zero-carbon hydrogen from water requires large amounts of electricity, and it is considering options to source that power. Ratcliffe is regularly counted among the UK’s richest people, although he moved to low-tax Monaco in 2020. He has used the £6bn fortune built up from Ineos to pursue various other interests, including a delayed attempt to build a rugged off-road vehicle, and purchases of several sports clubs. He has previously tried to buy Chelsea football club, and is seen as a possible bidder for Manchester United after its owners put it up for sale this month. The talks between Ineos and Rolls-Royce were still at an early stage, said one person with knowledge of the situation. Another person said that discussions had centred on understanding the technology, and that no commercial negotiations have taken place. The Sunday Telegraph first reported the contacts. The former prime minister Boris Johnson aimed to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s energy strategy in April as he responded to the chaos on global energy markets prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As well as building several large reactors capable of generating gigawatts of power, he also gave his approval to efforts to build megawatt-scale small modular reactors (SMRs). Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s outgoing chief executive, has said that the SMR revenues could end up being many times larger than its current business, as global demand for zero-carbon energy increases during the transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company still has a host of regulatory and political and financial problems to overcome, as well as proving that it can actually build the reactors in a factory at a cost to make them viable. However, Rolls-Royce is working to find locations for reactors. In September, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Czech nuclear engineering firm Škoda JS to look at sites in the Czech Republic and other parts of central Europe. Rolls-Royce this month said it was prioritising four sites of old nuclear reactors in the UK to install the new SMRs. They were Trawsfynydd and Wylfa in north Wales, a site near Sellafield in Cumbria, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. East will hand over the reins of the company to the ex-BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic in January, although the SMR effort is being headed internally by Tom Samson, who last week told a parliamentary committee that the company wanted to begin formal funding talks with the UK government. Ineos and Rolls-Royce declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T22:23:10Z","webTitle":"IAEA to inspect future nuclear-powered submarines built in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog will insist on inspecting Australia’s future nuclear submarines before and after deployments as part of a “watertight” agreement to ensure no fissile material is diverted, the agency’s chief has said. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the agency and the partners in the Aukus nuclear sharing agreement – the US, UK and Australia – will hold further negotiations on how to make sure it does not conflict with their non-proliferation obligations. The Aukus deal exploits a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty that allows nuclear fuel used for non-explosive military uses like naval propulsion to be exempted from IAEA inspections. As one of the ways of limiting the possibility that fissile material could be diverted to making weapons, nuclear fuel will be delivered to Australia in welded power units which would be installed in submarines to be assembled by Australia and ready by the 2040s. Grossi said that in negotiations with Australia, the IAEA would insist that its inspectors would be allowed to check the amount of nuclear fuel in the sealed units before and after the submarines put out to sea. “We have to check before it goes in the water, and when it comes back,” Grossi told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. “This requires highly sophisticated technical methods, because there will be welded units, [but] our inspectors will want to know what is inside and whether, when the boat comes back to port, everything is there and there has not been any loss. It’s the first time something like this will be done.” “We are going to be very demanding on what they are planning to do. So the process starts now. And the proof of the pudding is in the tasting,” Grossi said. Grossi is due to report on progress on the non-proliferation agreements related to the Aukus deal to the member states on the IAEA’s board in June. “We are going to put together a solid watertight system to try to have all the guarantees. If we cannot do that, we would never agree,” Grossi said. Arms control advocates have generally welcomed the precautionary measures adopted by the Aukus partners, but have expressed concern that the precedent it sets could encourage other states to use the NPT loophole potentially to use the pretext of developing nuclear naval propulsion as a way of hiding work on weapons. “If it was the case that country X wants to do this, they will have to do the exact same thing if they want to stay within the law,” Grossi said. “They will have to come to us. They will have to inform us what they are planning to do, and they will have to open a process of consultation and negotiation.” China has strenuously objected to the deal and its foreign ministry has alleged that the Aukus partners had “coerced” the IAEA into accepting it. “Countries have strong feelings about it,” Grossi said, but he added: “Nobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/sep/04/state-backed-disinformation-fuelling-anger-in-china-over-fukushima-wastewater-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-04T11:23:45Z","webTitle":"State-backed disinformation fuelling anger in China over Fukushima water","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/04/state-backed-disinformation-fuelling-anger-in-china-over-fukushima-wastewater-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/sep/04/state-backed-disinformation-fuelling-anger-in-china-over-fukushima-wastewater-japan","fields":{"bodyText":"Fake news and state-backed disinformation are fuelling Chinese anger at Japan over its release of treated wastewater from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant. In the last week, there have been reports of rocks and eggs thrown at Japanese schools in two Chinese cities, abusive phone calls to Japanese businesses and social media campaigns to boycott Japanese products including cosmetics. It has prompted Japan’s government to summon the Chinese ambassador and urge caution among its China-based citizens. Japan began its release of more than 1m tonnes of water on 24 August. The process, which is expected to take decades, has been approved by the UN atomic watchdog and mirrors similar wastewater releases by other countries including China. However, several countries have expressed concerns or objections, with China and Hong Kong announcing bans on importing Japanese seafood. The release of the treated water tapped into anti-Japanese sentiment in China, fuelled by government statements and state media that has loudly questioned the science behind the process, and accused Japan’s government of endangering the region. Fake or misattributed videos have claimed sea life is turning up dead on beaches, that there have been mass protests, and that a Japanese official who drank treated water from Fukushima at a 2011 press conference had died. Some examples collated by an Australian-based China analyst, Han Yang, on X, formerly known as Twitter, included footage of a rally in South Korea reported by Chinese state media as being in Japan, and fake news about a Japanese politician apparently suggesting Chinese visitors should be made to eat shellfish from Fukushima. News articles have also reported panic buying of salt in the belief that iodine will provide protection from radiation, and of Geiger counters to detect radiation. A study by the UK-based data analysis firm Logically found there were high volumes of state media reports and paid advertisements in multiple languages about the risk posed by the wastewater. It found unique posts about the topic on social media, by Chinese state media, officials and influencers, peaked at more than 3,500 in July, with some garnering more than a million views each. “China’s coordinated campaign amplifies climate change misinformation and health misinformation around wastewater release,” said Logically. “Logically identified similar coordinated campaigns with the Ohio train derailment in February 2023 where pro-China influencers cautioned its citizens not to consume ‘contaminated’ products from Ohio.” One video produced by the People’s Daily, titled “the truth of Fukushima”, claims there is a Japanese plot to knowingly discharge water that will “change” the sea while deliberately ignoring safer options. It carries tens of thousands of comments, many highly critical of Japan. A related hashtag has been engaged with more than 180m times in the last week. Anti-Japanese sentiment has long existed in China due to a fractious history between the two countries, but has been prevalent in recent years as Japan strengthens ties with the US and Taiwan and pushes back on Beijing’s regional expansionism and military aggression. Logically suggested China’s retaliatory reaction to the water release could continue, with a cosmetics ban potentially following the seafood ban, and Chinese state media predictions of mass Japanese restaurant closures in China and Hong Kong. “This could possibly have broader geopolitical implications and lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries,” it said. After the most recent spate of hostility, the Japanese government has taken the extraordinary step of warning its citizens not to speak Japanese too loudly in China. Last week Japan’s foreign ministry summoned China’s ambassador to request that Beijing urge calm among its citizens and ensure the safety of Japanese residents and businesses. “Regarding Alps [advanced liquid processing system] treated water, we should not unnecessarily heighten people’s anxiety by disseminating information that is not based on scientific basis, and we once again strongly urge that accurate information be disseminated,” the vice-minister Masataka Okano said. When asked if the government would urge calm among citizens, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told foreign media that China ensured the safety of foreign nationals, but said Tokyo’s “unilateral” release of the water had caused global outrage and this was the “root cause of the current situation”.

The plant’s supporters may have had its remote location, on a rugged peninsula in Japan’s north-east, in mind when they campaigned to bring nuclear power – and the promise of subsidies – to the town more than 40 years ago. Despite its seclusion, the plant is now in the political spotlight, as Japan prepares to again put its faith in nuclear power, more than a decade after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. In a sweeping change to the country’s energy policy, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced plans to build next-generation reactors and restart those left idle after the 2011 triple meltdown, in an attempt to end Japan’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and help meet its net zero target by 2050. Kishida’s “green transformation”, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the current maximum of 60 years, underlines Japan’s struggle to secure an affordable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and a power crunch that has triggered warnings of potential blackouts in Tokyo during this summer’s heatwave. Most of Japan’s nuclear power plants have remained offline since the Fukushima meltdown, and previous governments indicated they would not build new reactors or replace ageing ones, fearing a backlash from a shaken and sceptical public. Japan plans for nuclear to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030, compared with about a third before Fukushima. In 2020 the figure was less than 5%. Just 10 nuclear reactors among more than 30 have been restarted since the post-Fukushima introduction of stricter safety standards. If Kishida gets his way though, seven additional reactors will be restarted after next summer, including the No. 2 unit at Onagawa, which sustained structural damage from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami but escaped a catastrophic meltdown despite being the closest atomic plant to the quake’s epicentre. ‘A threat to the safety of local people’ The restart has been approved by Japan’s nuclear watchdog and given “local consent” by Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi – the prefecture where Onagawa is located. But many residents argue that contingency plans for potential accidents would put lives at risk. “The evacuation plans won’t work … they are a threat to the safety of local people,” says Masami Hino, one of 17 residents living within 30km of the plant who last year launched a legal action to block the restart, now scheduled for early 2024. In the event of a serious accident, 1,000 residents living within 5km of the plant would leave immediately, while 190,000 people within a 30km radius would evacuate in stages, according to the official blueprint. “There will be huge traffic jams, and we won’t be able to escape,” says Hino, who cited one expert simulation – dismissed by local authorities – showing that it could take up to five days for everyone to make it to safety. “If there is an accident it is ridiculous to think that people will leave in an orderly way,” he said. “They will just get out as quickly as they can and then get stuck for days without food, water or access to toilets.” Critics say an evacuation in the wake of an accident would clog the area’s narrow, winding roads, leaving people at risk of exposure to radiation. Most would leave in private cars, but others would have to board buses. The plant’s operator, Tohoku Electric Power, and local authorities would provide almost 1,000 staff to screen people for radiation exposure before directing them to temporary shelters. “How can Tohoku Electric and the prefecture guarantee that an evacuation would go smoothly after something like a major earthquake? It’s impossible,” says Mikiko Abe, an independent member of the Onagawa town assembly who has spent 40 years campaigning for the plant’s closure. “Instead of planning for an evacuation, wouldn’t it be better to live safely in a place where there’s no need to even think about fleeing our homes?” Kishida’s response to energy insecurity and the climate crisis has won the backing of Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), who said restarting more nuclear plants in Japan – one of the world’s biggest consumers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) – would free up more LNG and help ease Europe’s energy supply fears during the winter. Domestic opposition to a bigger role for nuclear in the energy mix appears to be weakening. A poll by the Nikkei business paper in June found that 53% of respondents agreed with putting reactors back into service if their safety could be assured – the first time that support for restarts had exceeded opposition since the 2011 triple disaster. While pro-nuclear members of the Miyagi prefectural assembly have helped resist calls for a referendum, a poll in April by the local Kahoku Shinpo newspaper found that 56% of residents were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed the restart. “All of Japan’s nuclear power plants are on the coast … and this is a country that has earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes,” says Tsuyoshi Suda, a member of local anti-nuclear group Kaze no Kai, as he looked at the plant – complete with a newly built 29-metre high seawall – from a nearby beach. “For Japan to keep putting its faith in nuclear power plants is like a form of self-destruction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain’s urgent need to commit to nuclear power | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"bodyText":"For a moment last week, our cash-strapped government seemed ready to abandon a project that many experts believe is central to our plans of achieving energy independence and net zero emissions. According to the BBC, the Treasury had indicated the proposed new nuclear reactor Sizewell C was on a list of major construction projects that were under review for possible cancellation. Its days could be numbered, it was suggested. The threat has since been denied by Number 10. The new atom plant in Suffolk will go ahead, it has insisted. For a nation that hopes to wean itself off its fossil fuel addiction and its dependence on natural gas imports, this is good news. The UK’s future prosperity depends on its ability to generate electricity, independently and at low cost and nuclear power is expected to play a critical role in ensuring this happens. The trouble is that these plans have very shaky foundations, as was revealed last week when uncertainties about Sizewell C first surfaced. Britain has pledged to close all its coal power plants by 2024 while those that burn oil and gas are to be phased out by 2035. After that, a mix of renewables and nuclear plants is expected to fill this capacity, lighting and warming our homes, running our factories and keeping our trains and electric cars moving. For their part, renewables are doing well, with wind and solar plants providing healthy chunks of power for the UK grid. This is not the case for the nuclear component of this energy package, however. Just as the nation’s fossil fuel plants are being closed down, reactors have been providing less and less power for the nation. In the 1990s, atomic power generated 25% of Britain’s electricity. By 2020, this figure had dropped to 16% and it will continue to decline as more of our ageing nuclear plants are closed. Of the six reactors currently in operation, five are destined for closure by 2028. One additional new reactor, Hinkley Point C, should be in operation by then, leaving Britain with two reactors and limited fossil fuel provision – in addition to renewable sources – to supply power for the nation. Unless new reactors are built, by 2050 British nuclear capacity – the proposed cornerstone of the nation’s energy supply for the future – will be a third of what it is today. Solar and wind power will no doubt do their bit but on a freezing cold, windless, winter evening, the UK’s lack of a central generating capacity will be cruelly exposed. Blackouts will be inevitable. The proposed Sizewell C reactor will therefore be welcome, though on its own the plant will be insufficient for the nation’s needs. Britain will require at least half a dozen such reactors to provide the gigawatts of electricity on which it will depend to fend off a future that lacks power to run our homes and operate our factories. The problem is that a new nuclear plant takes around a decade to build once it has been approved. By that arithmetic, time is now desperately tight if the United Kingdom is to have the numbers it requires to generate the power the country is going to need. Nuclear energy is certainly not without flaws. Construction costs and waste storage are two clear examples. However, the government has committed the nation to atomic power. Having done so, it is now obliged to act with a speed that will provide the country with sufficient nuclear electricity – and keep the lights on over the next two decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T19:14:06Z","webTitle":"Germany delays exit from nuclear power to offset energy shortfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany’s planned exit from nuclear power by the end of this year has been officially delayed in order to shore up energy supplies during an expected shortfall this winter, the economic minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Tuesday. The decision follows a shortage in supplies of electricity coming from France due to the fact that more than half of its nuclear power stations are offline, Habeck told journalists in Berlin. He said that the resulting gap in electricity supplies was being “observed with concern”, with Europe’s energy network in danger of being put under too much strain, potentially leading to power cuts. The electricity that Germany is not able to acquire from France is being compensated for with electricity produced by gas-fired power stations in Germany. But this in turn involves using up valuable supplies of gas that Germany is trying to save before winter arrives. Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations were due to be turned off at the end of this year, the end of an 11-year process. The decision to withdraw from nuclear power was made by the government of Angela Merkel after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Habeck had long resisted calls for the power plants in southern Germany – Isar 2 and Neckarwestheim 2 – to be extended as Germany coped with the effect of Russia slowing down, and then turning off completely, its gas supply via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 earlier this month. But his arguments against keeping the plants in operation became increasingly difficult to defend. A majority of Germans, despite being in favour of moving away from nuclear power, has said it is in favour of extending the plants’ use temporarily. Habeck had announced earlier this month that the plants would be put into a standby mode but would effectively stay offline unless needed. His decision amounts to an awkward U-turn, though Habeck said it was a reaction to the current situation, including what he called an escalation of the situation in Russia, “which is developing fairly dramatically”, and that he was resistant to populist demands. Habeck said that the necessary changes to the law covering the extension of the plants would be voted on in the Bundestag at the end of next month. Reacting to security concerns, and whether nuclear plants may be open to hacking attacks and terrorist threats, Habeck said the government was well aware of the concerns and was “doing its utmost” to secure them. German and Danish authorities were examining evidence on Tuesday suggesting that the Nord Stream pipelines 1 and 2 may have been deliberately damaged on Monday night in an act of sabotage, after dramatic drops of pressure in them and evidence of gas leaking into the Baltic Sea with possible explosions. Fingers have inevitably been pointed at Russia as a possible culprit. The incident has heightened concerns over the vulnerability of energy infrastructure in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T18:25:50Z","webTitle":"Wood burning stoves and the harm done by inflating the risk of nuclear power | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","fields":{"bodyText":"Your article on the harmful effects of burning wood (‘Eco’ wood burners produce 450 times more pollution than gas heating – report, 8 December) highlights a broader problem with risk management in public health. Very different values are placed on human life, depending on the specific risk. The level of air pollutants considered acceptable by the World Health Organization is already dangerous, increasing mortality by 2%. In contrast, the level of radioactivity considered acceptable is 100-500 times below levels that cause a similar increase in mortality. What this means is that a life lost to air pollution is valued 100- to 500-fold lower than a life lost to exposure to radioactivity. It is partly because of this difference, and the resulting regulatory regimes, that coal-fired power stations are much cheaper to build than nuclear power stations, even though they are at least 500 times more dangerous. It is only because of concerns about the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change that countries are now considering alternatives to coal, including nuclear power. If we had, from the outset, valued lives lost to air pollution the same as lives lost to radioactivity, we would have been building nuclear power plants rather than coal-fired power plants for the past 40 years. Many millions of lives would have been saved, and the climate emergency might have been avoided. Anton van der Merwe Oxford • Your article about wood burning stoves seems to be yet another example of individuals being made to feel responsible for the world’s environmental woes while governments and business pay little more than lip service to such issues. The wood that I burn is collected within a five-mile radius of my home, and I would guess that most wood burned domestically is similarly local. By contrast, Drax power station, about 15 miles from me, burns millions of tons of woodchips imported from forests in North America and elsewhere, brought here in huge, polluting tankers. But because it is called “biomass”, it attracts billions of pounds in government subsidies. While I am concerned about pollution, I will be continuing to burn biomass, without subsidy, for the foreseeable future.

The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said on Tuesday he had asked the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), “to swiftly prepare for the water discharge” in accordance with plans approved by nuclear regulators, adding that the release would begin on Thursday, “weather and ocean conditions permitting”. Kishida has said that disposing of more than 1m tonnes of water being stored at the site was an essential part of the long and complex process to decommission the plant. The plan has caused controversy because the water contains tritium, a radioactive substance that can’t be removed by the facility’s water filtration technology. Hong Kong, an important market for Japanese seafood exports, has threatened restrictions. Leader John Lee said on Tuesday he strongly opposed the water plan, adding that he had instructed the city’s government to “immediately activate” import controls on Japanese seafood. South Korea and China banned seafood imports from some areas of Japan after Fukushima Daiichi suffered a triple meltdown in the March 2011 triple disaster along the country’s north-east coast. China remains strongly opposed, accusing Japan of treating the ocean like a “sewer”. The South Korean government recently dropped its objections to the discharge, but opposition parties and many South Koreans are concerned about the impact the discharge will have on food safety. The decision comes weeks after the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), approved the discharge, saying that the radiological impact on people and the environment would be “negligible”. Some experts point out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. “Tritium has been released [by nuclear power plants] for decades with no evidential detrimental environmental or health effects,” said Tony Hooker, a nuclear expert from the University of Adelaide. Greenpeace, however, has described the filtration process as flawed, and warned that an “immense” quantity of radioactive material will be dispersed into the sea over the coming decades. Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace East Asia, said Japan’s government “has opted for a false solution – decades of deliberate radioactive pollution of the marine environment – during a time when the world’s oceans are already facing immense stress and pressures. “This is an outrage that violates the human rights of the people and communities of Fukushima, and other neighbouring prefectures and the wider Asia-Pacific region.” The government and Tepco also face opposition from local fishers, who say pumping water into the Pacific Ocean will destroy their industry. In a meeting on Monday with Masanobu Sakamoto, the head of the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, Kishida attempted to reassure fishing communities that the discharge was safe. Ahead of the meeting, Sakamoto said his group’s opposition to the plan had “not changed one bit”. He said they understood that the water release could be scientifically safe, but still feared reputational damage. Those fears were echoed in a poll published this week by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, in which 75% of respondents said the government had not done enough to prevent the expected reputational damage to Japanese seafood. Kishida acknowledged those concerns but insisted that the water release “is absolutely not something we can put off if we want to decommission the Fukushima nuclear plant and revive the area”. “I promise that we will take on the entire responsibility of ensuring the fishing industry can continue to make their living, even if that will take decades,” he told reporters on Monday. The government has set up funds worth ¥30bn ($206m) to compensate local fishers for reputational damage, and ¥50bn to address any financial impact on their business, according to the Kyodo news agency. The wastewater, which includes rain and groundwater, becomes contaminated when it is used to cool nuclear fuel rods damaged in 2011 when a powerful tsunami crashed into the plant, knocking out its backup electricity supply. About 1.3m tonnes of treated water – enough to fill 500 Olympic swimming pools – is being held in more than 1,000 steel tanks on the site, but Tepco has warned that storage space is running out. Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system removes most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The water will be diluted to one 40th of the concentration permitted under Japanese safety standards before being pumped into the ocean over the next 30 to 40 years via an underwater tunnel 1km from the coast. Tomoaki Kobayakawa, Tepco’s president, said the firm had a “strong determination to prevent reputational damage” during the discharge period. Tepco, he added, will “devote all of its resources to ensuring the safety and quality of facility operation, speedily obtaining monitoring results and disseminating that information in an accurate and easy-to-understand manner”. The water will be released at a maximum rate of 500,000 litres a day. A Japanese official said the first results of tests on discharged seawater could be available at the start of next month. Japan will also test fish in the waters near the plant, and make the results available on the agriculture ministry’s website.

Just as tree rings can provide snapshots of the Earth’s climate, and ice cores can give us information on past temperature, researchers found that the layers of shells can be used as a time stamp of periods with nuclear fallout. Research published in the scientific journal PNAS Nexus investigates how uranium builds up in the outer shells of chelonians, the order of reptiles that includes tortoises and turtles. “When we consider the legacies of 20th century nuclear deployment, testing, and production, we must now also consider chelonians and their lived experience in areas where these activities occurred,” the research stated. The researchers focused on turtles and tortoises from areas that have seen nuclear contamination, and measured the uranium that was present in the scute, the bony outer shell that is usually made of keratin. Each layer of shell equates to one year of its life, and so can reveal what happened in the tortoise’s surrounding environment. Five different chelonians from natural history collections were studied. One of these came from Enewetak Atoll, and was collected in 1978. Enewetak Atoll and its neighbour, Bikini Atoll, in the Pacific, were the site of 67 nuclear tests, with Enewetak the site of 43 of these. Though the sea turtle was probably not alive during the time of the testing, researchers still found uranium contamination in the turtle 20 years after testing ended. However, consumption of uranium-contaminated algae, or other legacy contamination present in the atoll, may have contributed to the presence of uranium in that turtle. Researchers also looked at an eastern box turtle from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the US. Oak Ridge is the site of a nuclear facility that has produced and processed uranium since 1943. The turtle that was studied from there was collected in 1962 and may have bioaccumulated radionuclides, or radioactive materials, from uranium waste products in the area. The researchers were able to identify uranium isotopic composition across the scute from these turtles. The research supports the idea that these animals can bioaccumulate human-made radionuclides, or from the environment. It also supports the idea that these animals, which often live a long time, can record information about human activity with nuclear landscapes over a long period. “We anticipate that combining analyses of historically collected and modern specimens will significantly expand our environmental monitoring abilities as they relate to ongoing nuclear contamination questions,” the study said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jul/18/commitment-to-push-forward-with-small-nuclear-reactors-seems-sensible","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-18T17:55:51Z","webTitle":"Commitment to push forward with small nuclear reactors seems sensible | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jul/18/commitment-to-push-forward-with-small-nuclear-reactors-seems-sensible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jul/18/commitment-to-push-forward-with-small-nuclear-reactors-seems-sensible","fields":{"bodyText":"New logo, new faces, and new promises to move at “unprecedented scale and pace” in driving the expansion of nuclear power in the UK. One should regard the fanfare for Great British Nuclear, the new government body, with scepticism because nothing moves quickly in the world of nuclear energy. Hinkley Point C, the enormous project in Somerset, is years behind schedule and Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, arrived bearing no fresh news on how (or if) the successor station at Sizewell C in Suffolk will be funded. Yet there was a genuinely interesting – and welcome – piece of news. The government finally seems committed to exploring small modular reactors (SMRs), the cut-down versions of a nuclear power plant that have the potential – a crucial qualification at this stage – to become more commercially interesting prospects than monsters the size of Hinkley and Sizewell. A competition to pick the best designs will be run. To critics of nuclear power, there is nothing new to see. Small stations are over-hyped and untested, and will probably be as infected by delays and cost overruns as traditional mega projects, they argue. And, of course, they may be proved right in time. While the technology (if approved) should be reliable because the UK’s safety standards are genuinely world-leading, the economics of SMRs are yet to encounter the real world of construction. Nobody has built one yet. The point, though, is the one about potential. The construction theory says smaller designs allow “a relentless focus on modularisation,” as Rolls-Royce, near the front of the pack in this race to develop SMRs, puts it. Most of the work done in factories and finished parts are then transported by road for assembly. Construction risk, which is what traditionally causes budget blow-outs with huge plants, ought to be reduced. The first SMR may take a half a decade to build, but a £2.5bn project still looks easier to manage than a £30bn-ish one. The output of Rolls’ design is only 470MW, against a combined 3.2GW for Hinkley’s twin reactors. But the gain, if the model is proved, should be the ability to replicate and the relative nimbleness in ordering new plants to meet demand. Finding suitable sites also ought to be a simpler affair. It is on that basis that a commitment to push SMRs to the next stage of development is sensible. Rolls isn’t the only game in town by any means, but its design is the furthest advanced through the UK regulatory process and the project has already had £210m of public investment (plus £290m from backers). Given the possibility of building a serious export industry over decades, it would be perverse not to press on. The mini-tragedy in the expansion of windfarms in the UK is that the turbines are all imported. Yes, expansion of wind, solar and batteries must also be accelerated urgently. But, if the UK is serious about building 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050 to meet a quarter of our projected electricity needs and our net zero pledges, it is a high-risk strategy to bet everything on cumbersome projects such as Hinkley and Sizewell. In a saner world for energy policy, we would already know by now if the economics of SMRs are superior. There are no guarantees of success and it’s fair to observe that SMRs have been pitched as the next big thing for about a decade already. We are, though, at a point where choices have to be made. Get on with it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jul/10/the-big-idea-why-climate-tribalism-only-helps-the-deniers","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-10T11:30:12Z","webTitle":"The big idea: why climate tribalism only helps the deniers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/10/the-big-idea-why-climate-tribalism-only-helps-the-deniers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jul/10/the-big-idea-why-climate-tribalism-only-helps-the-deniers","fields":{"bodyText":"One of the most effective ways to be a climate sceptic is to say nothing at all. Why expend the effort slapping down climate solutions when you can rely on feuding climate activists to tear each other’s ideas apart? We tend to fight with those we are closest to. This is true of family. But it’s also true of our peers, which for me, are those obsessed with trying to fix climate change. Step into the murky waters of Twitter and you’ll often find activists spending more time going after one another than battling climate falsehoods. These might seem like small squabbles, but they have a real impact. They slow our progress and play into the hands of the deniers, the oil companies, the anti-climate lobbyists. These groups push on while our heads are turned. What we want to achieve is the same: to reduce carbon emissions. The problem is that we are stubborn about how we get there. We often have strong opinions about what the evils are, and how to fix them. The nuclear zealots want to go all-in on building new power stations. The renewable zealots want no nuclear at all. Some promote electric cars; their opponents want car-less roads. Vegans advocate for cutting out animal products; flexitarians feel judged when they eat their weekly roast chicken. These cracks can start at an even higher level. For some it is not about the specific technology we deploy, it’s about the fact that we see technology as a solution at all. There are those who believe that technology will fix everything. Their detractors think this techno-optimism is naive; only radical economic and social change can save us. Such inner-circle battles aren’t specific to climate. They are everywhere. The American economist Michael Munger wrote about this very same tension in economic policy, describing how the world is split into “directionalists” and “destinationists”. Directionalists back any solution that takes us towards the final goal. In climate, this means they support anything that puts a notable dent in emissions. Destinationists are less flexible: they have an ideal outcome in mind. They block and reject anything that doesn’t fit their perfect vision. If they want to see a car-less world, they push against electric vehicles (EVs), even if they would cut emissions by a lot. Destinationalism is a problem. Sure, we all have our favourite solutions. But the reality is that we can’t afford to be choosy. The answer to almost every climate dilemma is “We need both”. We need renewables and nuclear energy (even if that means just keeping our existing nuclear plants online). We need to tackle fossil fuels and our food system; fossil fuels are the biggest emitter, but emissions from food alone would take us well past a temperature rise of 1.5C and close to 2C. Not everyone can commute without a car, so we need electric vehicles and cycle-friendly cities and public transport networks. We can’t decarbonise without technological change, but we need to rethink our economic, political and social systems to make sure they flourish. These battles are not just neutral noises off; they actively help the other side. Fossil fuel companies don’t need to dunk on nuclear power because many environmentalists have done it for them. Take Germany, where nuclear plants were closed early, delaying the phasing-out of coal power. This was not only bad for the climate but for air pollution too. Many people on the pro-nuclear side didn’t help: their bashing of renewable energy technologies made anti-nuclear environmentalists even more defensive. Or there’s the claim that EVs can be just as bad for the environment, often trotted out even in green-leaning media. In response, people are persuaded to stick with their petrol or diesel car. Similarly, meat-eaters who are considering cutting back see claims about how “unhealthy” and “processed” some plant-based burgers are, and opt for beef instead. The solution isn’t to stop debating. I’m not claiming we should uncritically support every proposal on the table. That would waste money, time and resources. Our efforts would become scattered and diluted. We’d focus on the wrong things. We need to be intensely critical to make sure we invest in climate solutions that are effective and can scale. And no solution is a panacea – EVs, lab-grown meat, renewable energy, nuclear power – all have some impact. We need to be transparent about those impacts to reduce them as much as we can. So how can we make these debates work better? First, we need to become less fixated on the ideal pathway. None of us will get precisely what we want; we need to compromise and take a route that reduces emissions effectively and quickly, using a combination of solutions. Second, we need to be more generous when dealing with our rivals. Intellectual disagreements can quickly descend into name-calling. Real conversation stops and we talk past one another instead. We become more focused on winning the argument than understanding the other side. This makes the climate solution space hostile, which is counterproductive considering we want the world’s best minds to be there. Third, we need to be honest about what is and isn’t true about the solutions we don’t like. “EVs emit just as much CO2 as petrol cars” is simply wrong. They emit significantly less, even if they emit more than the subway or a bike (and yes, this is still true when we account for the emissions needed to produce the battery). “Nuclear energy is unsafe” is wrong – it’s thousands of times safer than the coal we’re trying to replace, and just as safe as renewables. It’s fine to advocate for your preferred solutions, but it’s not OK to lie about the alternatives to make your point. In short, we need to become better directionalists. To focus on moving towards our goals, rather than pinning all our hopes on an ideal means of getting there. Whether you’re a fan of nuclear or solar, electric cars or trains, lab-grown meat or lentils: we are all on the same team.

Scientists have used eye and earwitnesses accounts, along with data from tide gauges, satellites, evidence of broken windows and other sources, to calculate that the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which occurred on 15 January 2022 and was felt around the world, likely involved five blasts. The last of them released energy equivalent to about 15 megatonnes of TNT. That is around 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and puts the volcanic event on a par with the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the US: the Castle Bravo bomb detonated at Bikini Atoll in 1954. The team, based at institutions in the US and New Zealand, added that the volcanic event, which occurred 65km (40 miles) from the country’s main island, involved both eruptions – which resulted in huge volcanic plumes being thrust into the stratosphere – and explosions of steam, which caused sonic booms and were the main cause of the related tsunami. The researchers’ computer simulations of the event, based on a combination of data sources, suggest the western coast of Tofua Island experienced waves of up to 45 metres in height, a result they say is backed up by signs of vegetation scars at the same altitude captured by satellite and drone data. The eruption brought reports of people experiencing the ground and buildings shaking for hours as far away as Fiji – nearly 500 miles away. It is thought that six people died as a result of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcanic event, including four people in Tonga and two in Peru who drowned as a result of abnormally large waves caused by the volcanic activity. The team say the huge waves in parts of Tonga would have been expected to result in a larger death toll – yet this was not the case. “The main factors that led to this, we suggest, are the quirk of the location, a worldwide pandemic, and increased evaluation drills and awareness efforts carried out in the years prior,” they write in the journal Science Advances. Tofua is uninhabited and other areas that experienced large waves were sparsely populated, while tourist resorts were closed because of Covid. “The main settlements in all of Tonga safely face Nuku’alofa Lagoon, the best possible scenario to duck the full brunt of a mega-tsunami,” the authors note, adding that other inhabited islands sit atop a carbonate platform where shallow waters damped down the waves. The new study follows research published last year that revealed that the Tonga volcano eruption had the highest plume ever recorded, with an ash cloud that reached 57km (35 miles) in height. Dr Mohammad Heidarzadeh of the University of Bath, who was not involved in the new study but has also carried out research into the event, said the latest work offered the most detailed modelling of the Tonga tsunami so far by benefiting from a diverse observation dataset. “Modelling tsunamis from volcano eruptions is a challenging task and this has been nicely done by [the team],” he said. “It is interesting that the results are consistent with our previous study on this event, where we reported a maximum tsunami wave height of 90m.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/02/xi-jinping-replaces-generals-in-charge-of-chinas-nuclear-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-02T12:17:04Z","webTitle":"Xi Jinping replaces generals in charge of China’s nuclear arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/02/xi-jinping-replaces-generals-in-charge-of-chinas-nuclear-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/02/xi-jinping-replaces-generals-in-charge-of-chinas-nuclear-arsenal","fields":{"bodyText":"Two of China’s top generals overseeing its nuclear missiles have been replaced with scant explanation in the biggest shake-up of the country’s military leadership in a decade, underlining Xi Jinping’s commitment to tightening control over the armed forces. Two men from outside the ranks of the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) were appointed to head the unit, state media have reported. Wang Houbin, from the navy, was appointed as commander and Xu Xisheng, from the air force, its political commissar – a Chinese Communist party role of equal grade to military commander. The whereabouts of Wang’s predecessor, Li Yuchao, are unknown, although the South China Morning Post reported last week that Li had been taken away for investigation by China’s corruption watchdog, along with his deputy commander and a previous deputy commander. The PLARF, established in 2016, is one of China’s most important military divisions, overseeing the army’s land-based conventional and nuclear ballistic missiles. The force has a number of bases located strategically near the Taiwan strait and would be critical in any potential attempted annexation of the self-governing island. That has made the appointment of two generals without a background in the rocket force all the more surprising. Xi – China’s leader and military commander-in-chief – has in recent months emphasised the need to tighten the Communist party’s control over the military, an issue that has troubled party elders since the foundation of the People’s Republic. In a speech to military leaders in July, he stressed the importance of “maintaining the party’s absolute leadership over the military and ensuring stronger combat readiness”. The anti-corruption push that Xi has used to assert control since coming to power in 2012 has also extended to the military. According to Beijing, it has swept up 2 million “tigers and flies” – Xi’s phrase for targeting both high- and low-ranking cadres – in the finance, energy, sports and business worlds. From the military, it has felled Fang Fenghui, the former PLA chief of staff, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2019 after being convicted on corruption charges. The military’s equipment department last week announced that it was investigating corruption relating to procurement bids and the formation of private cliques dating back to 2017. The review would also investigate the leaking of secret information, the notice said. Some observers have drawn a link between the military purges and the attempted coup by the Wagner group in Russia in June, when the government-funded paramilitary organisation staged an ultimately unsuccessful rebellion against Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. But, mindful of the risks of such insurrections, the PLA has never allowed paramilitary groups to operate with Wagner levels of autonomy, making such a dramatic rebellion unlikely. Others emphasise that the latest purges in China’s PLA should be seen in the context of a decade-long campaign to tighten the party’s control over all aspects of society. “We need to see this as part of the much larger anti-corruption campaign that’s happening across the government,” said Meia Nouwens, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a thinktank. Although China’s anti-corruption watchdog has not commented publicly on the removal of Li and his underlings, the status of about 10 current and former PLARF officials is believed to be unclear. Rumours have swirled around what, if anything, Li and other PLARF officials who have been removed are accused of. One unnamed source speaking to the South China Morning Post said they had become “immoral” since moving to PLARF’s Beijing headquarters, which gave them the opportunity to monetise their privileged positions in one of China’s most closely watched military divisions. Reports have also suggested the fact that people outside China had an unusually detailed understanding of the PLARF’s structure had triggered suspicion of the force’s leaders. “In general, loyalty is a concern for the military,” Nouwens said. That has been a concern since before Xi came to power, but it is especially important now “because they are trying to modernise the force to make it more flexible and reactive. To do that they would need to devolve decision-making powers, and that means changing the very top-down structures.” The appointment of two non-PLARF officials to the top jobs could suggest that “this is potentially about breaking patronages”, Nouwens said, emphasising that most analysis is highly speculative at this stage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/11/russia-nuclear-plants-ukrainians-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-11T13:19:59Z","webTitle":"Will Russia target nuclear plants?

But this cautious approach could backfire, leading us closer to nuclear catastrophe. For Ukrainians, the question of whether Russia will sabotage the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest, located in southern Ukraine, has long been a “when”, not an “if”. Last week, Ukrainian civilians and officials shared panicked messages on social media as fears of a potential attack crystallised. Russian embassies and Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson appeared to be preparing disinformation lines, suggesting that Ukraine, which suffered so terribly from the Chornobyl nuclear accident, could deliberately unleash radioactive terror on its own people. While unconvincing, the rhetoric was an eerie and foreboding reminder of past Kremlin disinformation campaigns following Russian atrocities: the Skripal poisonings, the Bucha massacre, the downing of passenger jet MH17, and the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The instinct by some of Ukraine’s allies to reduce the risk of Russia turning to its nuclear arsenal is entirely correct, but the tactics are misguided. The west’s mixed signals over its willingness to defend Ukraine are widely considered to have contributed to Putin’s decision to launch his genocidal war. Since the invasion 17 months ago, Putin appears to have remained convinced that he has the “strategic patience” to outlast the west and assure his victory. In his defence, he can cite some compelling evidence to support his belief. After Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, the US and EU response was underwhelming – limited to symbolic but often ineffective personal sanctions. More recently, the international community’s muted reaction to the Kakhovka dam catastrophe will have hardly caused him to reconsider his strategy. But in the absence of a clear, coordinated plan to deal with Russia’s escalating nuclear threats, western leaders have edged us closer to the nuclear disaster they are seeking to avoid. Russia possesses the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, a dubious achievement it is not shy of broadcasting. A nuclear war would herald the end of global civilisation. Even use of a tactical nuclear weapon, resulting in a smaller explosion, would be a catastrophe for Ukraine. Any serious assessment of nuclear risk means not underestimating this. But it is also crucial that western leaders consider the consequences of being cowed by Putin’s threats, which are designed to force the world to indulge his rapacious appetite to destroy Ukraine. By providing Ukraine with war-winning military support, the west can send a message to the Kremlin – and any other irredentist powers – that using nuclear threats will not work. Focusing on Russia’s nuclear arsenal alone distracts from more immediate threats, namely the alleged positioning of explosives around ZNPP, which has been under occupation by Russian armed forces since March 2022. Russia has amassed military personnel and equipment inside the facility, and there are reports that the children and families of Ukrainian operators forced to work at ZNPP are being held hostage in Russia, having been removed from the vicinity of the plant under the guise of “evacuation”. Against the backdrop of ongoing Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the fear that the Kremlin is preparing an act of nuclear terrorism is far from unreasonable. When this could occur or what this act might look like remains unclear. Some experts suggest that it is likely Russia will blow up a small part of the plant, such as a cooled reactor, to display what it is capable of, or to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive. This would be unlikely to lead to radiation leakage – but there are also much riskier scenarios. A stronger explosion could cause damage to the protective shell of a reactor, spreading radiation approximately 350 miles from the site of the blast and creating a disaster of catastrophic scale. Perhaps the threats can be dismissed as part of Russia’s information warfare – another way to terrorise the Ukrainian civilian population. Last week, 10 Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian missiles in Lviv, Ukraine’s most western and peaceful city. But nuclear catastrophe is not something to leave to chance or half measures. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked under trying conditions to ensure the safety of the plant, but it has lost the confidence of many in Ukraine. In its latest inspection, the IAEA insisted the plant was secure but also requested further access, as it was prevented from viewing parts of the site where Ukrainian officials claim mines have been planted. This situation is untenable. Much more robust action is needed to restore nuclear safety, and confidence. The best possible chance of demilitarising (and de-occupying) ZNPP would involve a multilateral taskforce formed of parties trusted by all sides, including the US, China, India, the UK and the EU, which could supervise the area around the station with IAEA support and expertise. In the absence of such efforts, much of Europe remains hostage to fortune. World leaders must now face up to some tough decisions, rather than giving in once more to Russian blackmail or ignoring the problem until it starts to radiate into Ukraine’s atmosphere – and beyond.

Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Fears over the safety risks for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, have been constant throughout Russia’s invasion, but increased in early June after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the source of cooling water for its reactors. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. He added: “The world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else.” Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. In an address from the Kremlin to a virtual gathering of leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group founded by Russia and China to counter western influence, the Russian president attempted to rebuff any suggestion that he had been weakened by last week’s chaotic but short-lived rebellion led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces.

Today’s newsletter comes to you from Manchester, original home of the Guardian (est 1821), and me, Helen Pidd, your friendly north of England editor. I’ll be writing the daily briefing alongside Nimo for the next few weeks. Our latest edition concerns events in Japan 12 years ago, when a huge earthquake struck off the country’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl. More than a decade later, the clean-up continues at Fukushima. This week the Japanese government announced that work will begin on Thursday to pump more than one million tonnes of water into the sea from the destroyed Daiichi nuclear power plant, in a move that has prompted horror from environmental groups and consternation in neighbouring countries. Is it madness to pollute the Pacific Ocean with enough tainted water to fill at least 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools? I spoke to the Guardian’s Japan correspondent, Justin McCurry, as he packed his bags to return to Fukushima, saying that he had no qualms about drinking the local sake and how the area has become a surfing hotspot once more. In depth: ‘Plants pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid’ On 11 March 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami that knocked out the backup electricity supply at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan’s north-eastern Pacific coast, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors. Ever since, 1.34m tonnes of radioactive water has accumulated at the site, according to the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). This includes liquid used for cooling, plus rain and groundwater that has seeped in. Earlier this year, Justin visited the site, and saw the thousand or so steel tanks being used to house the contaminated water (pictured above). “They’re three storeys high and are all together across a wide area,” he said. Tepco says it will soon run out of storage room and this week was granted permission to start releasing “treated” water from the tanks into the Pacific Ocean. The plan has caused controversy because the water contains tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that can’t be removed by the facility’s water filtration technology. It will not be pumped out all at once, but over the next 30 to 40 years. The first discharge, starting on Thursday (weather permitting) will total 7,800 cubic metres over about 17 days, Tepco said. For those of you not great at visualising volumes, that’s about three Olympic swimming pools. *** Is it dangerous? The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has approved the discharge, saying that the radiological impact on people and the environment would be “negligible”. The levels of tritium will be 1/40th of the legal level for discharges, Tepco insists, and has promised to upload hourly data on water quality. The scientific consensus has persuaded Justin that “as long as you are exposed to tritium in low doses, it doesn’t represent a threat to human health”. Greenpeace, however, has described the filtration process as flawed, and warned that an “immense” quantity of radioactive material will be dispersed into the sea over the coming decades. Concerns have also been raised by the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the main intergovernmental organisation representing the region, which has been consulting with Japan over the release for the past two years and in January said it had “grave concerns” over the plans. In June, the PIF issued a statement drawing attention to international laws against dumping nuclear waste in the Pacific. Justin has come to the view that storing the water indefinitely is not a realistic option: “When does it end? What are you going to do with 2m tonnes, 3m tonnes? What about a leak? That area gets tsunamis, it gets quakes, it gets typhoons. What if something like that were to happen and lots of the tanks were damaged?” But much remains unknown. Justin asked a “very sensible” anti-nuclear expert if it would be safe for him to go swimming in the sea in Fukushima in September. The expert said yes, but that the problem is not swimming but “organically bound tritium – over the years, when it gets into seaweed, shellfish or fish and then consumed by humans over a long period. What does that do to human health? It’s difficult to say.” *** The fallout Some of Japan’s neighbours are very unhappy. Hong Kong – the second-largest importer of food products from Japan after mainland China – said it will ban “aquatic products” from 10 Japanese prefectures. That includes the capital Tokyo, as well as Fukushima itself. Last month, Chinese customs administration threatened a blanket ban on all foodstuffs from the same 10 areas. Though South Korea’s government has given Japan its blessing, many residents are panicking, with reports that some people are stockpiling sea salt. Justin says there is an element of hypocrisy there. “Nuclear power plants, including those in South Korea, and China, pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid.” China, he said, saw the controversy as a “very useful stick with which to beat Japan at the moment”. Japanese fishers are understandably worried about the damage to their reputation. So too are the marine-related tourist businesses which have started to reopen in Fukushima. Next month Justin is due in Fukushima again to cover an international surfing festival. Having visited the area on numerous occasions since 2011, including at least six visits to the wrecked power plant itself, he has no worries about his health on his latest trip. “I might not have time for a swim,” he says. “But, as always, I will eat locally, and I will bring one or two bottles of Fukushima sake back to Tokyo with me.” For more context, watch this Guardian video on how Japan is making radioactive water safe.

Scholz shut down criticism from the opposition conservative alliance and at least one leading economist, who have described his coalition’s decision to keep two remaining reactors in emergency reserve rather than letting them produce electricity, as “madness” while the government refuses to reverse its long-term plan to close down the last remaining plants. Criticism about the nuclear roadmap is also coming from within Scholz’s government. His coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, has urged Scholz to overturn the 2011 ban on nuclear power introduced by Angela Merkel as a reaction to the Fukushima disaster. In a heated parliamentary debate on Wednesday morning, Scholz defended his government’s strategy to tackle the energy crisis. Facing fierce criticism from the opposition, he said his government was confronting problems created by the previous administration under Merkel – in which he served. The crisis, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has been exacerbated in recent weeks by Moscow’s reduction of gas supplies to Germany, which was followed a week ago by a complete halt. Moscow has cited maintenance issues linked to sanctions imposed by the west. Scholz accused Friedrich Merz’s conservative alliance (CDU/CSU) of refusing to accept responsibility for its role in the crisis, calling it “the party which holds complete responsibility for the fact that Germany made decisions to withdraw both from coal and from atomic energy, but never had the strength to enter into anything else”. He also accused the conservatives of failing to embrace renewable energy and actively campaigning against it. “You were incapable of bringing about the expansion of renewable energies. You led defensive battles against every single wind turbine,” he said. By trying now to save as much gas, electricity and oil as it can before winter kicks in – in part with the construction of LNG terminals and expanding renewable energy – Scholz said his government was “solving problems that the union failed to recognise as such when it was in power”. Scholz said Germans would “rise above themselves” and deal with the coming winter with “with boldness and bravery” and said that Germany was close to its goal of becoming independent from Russian gas exports. Gas storage facilities were 86% full on Wednesday. Merz accused Scholz’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, of “pandering to environmental lobbyists” and squandering the chance to find solutions to the energy crisis by seeking what he called a “lazy compromise” by refusing to allow Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations to continue operation for the next two to three years. On Monday Habeck had announced that two of them would remain “on standby” supported by the necessary staff, equipment and security, but would not be producing electricity unless needed. Merz said the decision was irresponsible, arguing that continuing running the plants would help secure energy supplies and that the increased electricity production would help control the market price. “The ignorance shown to this topic is written all over your face,” he said to Habeck, calling the last existing nuclear power plants “the most modern and safe reactors in the world”. In Wednesday’s Bundestag debate, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right AfD, accused the government of leading Germany to financial ruin with its policies, including a €65bn (£56bn) package announced on Sunday, aimed to ease household finances. “You have every reason to fear a heated autumn and winter,” she said, in reference to figures on the right and left who have called for protests against high living costs. She said people had “every right” to take to the streets. Amira Mohamed Ali, parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke, accused the coalition government of having “no social conscience”. She urged the government to approach Russia in an attempt to bring it to the negotiating table and end its hostilities in Ukraine. The instability of nuclear power is one of the main reason for not relying on it, the economics ministry argued when it presented its plans on Monday. Currently only 28 of 56 plants in France are on the grid, due in part to the shortage of cooling water linked to this summer’s drought, meaning Germany has had to supply its neighbour with electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/24/japan-begins-releasing-fukushima-wastewater-into-pacific-ocean","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-24T07:57:36Z","webTitle":"China bans Japanese seafood after Fukushima wastewater release ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/24/japan-begins-releasing-fukushima-wastewater-into-pacific-ocean","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/24/japan-begins-releasing-fukushima-wastewater-into-pacific-ocean","fields":{"bodyText":"Japan has begun discharging more than 1m tonnes of tainted water into the Pacific Ocean from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in a move that has prompted China to announce an immediate blanket ban on all seafood imports from Japan and sparked anger in nearby fishing communities. The plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), pumped a small quantity of water from the plant on Thursday, two days after the plan was approved by Japan’s government. Tepco said the release began at 1:03pm local time (0403 GMT) and it had not identified any abnormalities with the seawater pump or surrounding facilities. Live video showed engineers behind computer screens and an official saying – after a countdown – that the “valves near the seawater transport pumps are opening.” Monitors from the UN atomic watchdog, which has endorsed the plan, were due to be on site for the procedure, while Tepco workers were scheduled to take water samples later on Thursday. The discharge, which is expected to take 30 to 40 years, has caused anger in neighbouring countries and concern among fishers that it will destroy their industry as consumers steer clear of seafood caught in and around Fukushima. On Thursday, China’s customs agency announced it would “completely suspend the import of aquatic products originating in Japan”, effective immediately, in order to “prevent the risk of radioactive contamination of food safety”. The Chinese government has been highly critical of the planned water release, branding it “extremely selfish and irresponsible”. “The ocean is the common property of all humanity, and forcibly starting the discharge of Fukushima’s nuclear wastewater into the ocean is an extremely selfish and irresponsible act that ignores international public interests,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said in a statement. It warned of a potential “man-made secondary disaster to the local people and the whole world” following the original 2011 Fukushima disaster. “By dumping the water into the ocean, Japan is spreading the risks to the rest of the world and passing an open wound onto the future generations of humanity.” On Thursday, South Korean police arrested at least 14 people who entered a building housing the Japanese embassy in Seoul during a protest against the release, an organiser and a Reuters witness said. The water will initially be released in modest quantities and with extra checks, Tepco said, with the first discharge, totalling 7,800 cubic metres, expected to last about 17 days. The utility will start the release “carefully and from a small amount”, an official in charge of the processed water said. How to dispose of wastewater that has built up at the site on Japan’s north-east coast has proved a diplomatic headache for the government, despite support for its approach from the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The water became contaminated after it was used to cool three nuclear reactors that melted down after Fukushima Daiichi was struck by a powerful tsunami in March 2011. The waves knocked out the plants backup electricity supply and forced the evacuation of 160,000 people, in the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl. On-site technology is used to remove most harmful substances, but it is unable to filter out tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that is considered to be relatively harmless because, according to Tepco, it emits very weak levels of radiation and does not accumulate or concentrate inside the human body. Critics of the discharge say a lack of long-term data means it is impossible to say with certainty that tritium poses no threat to human health or the marine environment. Greenpeace said the radiological risks had not been fully assessed, and that the biological impacts of tritium, carbon-14, strontium-90 and iodine-129 – which will be released as part of the discharge – “have been ignored”. Ahead of Thursday’s release, Tepco said the first batch of discharged water would contain about 190 becquerels of tritium per litre – well below the World Health Organization drinking water limit of 10,000 becquerels per litre. The water will be released at a maximum rate of 500,000 litres (132,000 US gallons) a day. Japanese officials say the water – which is being diluted with seawater before being pumped into the Pacific via an undersea tunnel – is safe. That view was backed by a recent IAEA safety review in which it said the release would have a “negligible” radiological effect on people and the environment. But assurances over food safety have failed to convince China. Hours before the discharge was due to begin, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the move “extremely selfish”, adding that Beijing had lodged a formal complaint with Japan’s ambassador to China. Wang said China would “take all necessary measures to protect the marine environment, food safety, and public health. “The ocean is the common property of all humankind, not a place for Japan to arbitrarily dump nuclear-contaminated water,” Wang said. An article in the English-language edition of the state-run Global Times accused Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, of opening a Pandora’s box by approving the release. “What will be unleashed once the Pandora’s box is open?” the newspaper said. “The answer to this question may become a landmine threatening the ecological environment of the world and the fears of real-life Godzilla among the public worldwide.” China banned imports of food and agricultural products from five Japanese prefectures soon after the 2011 triple disaster, and later widened its ban to cover 10 of Japan’s 47 prefectures. Hong Kong’s chief executive, John Lee, said releasing the water into the ocean was “irresponsible”, adding that the city would activate import controls on Japanese seafood from regions including Fukushima and Tokyo from Thursday. The ban will cover live, frozen, refrigerated, and dried seafood, as well as sea salt and seaweed. South Korea, once an outspoken critic of the plans, has said that it accepts the science behind the discharge, but has stopped short of publicly supporting Japan’s approach amid concerns over food safety among the South Korean public. Some experts have pointed out that nuclear power plants in other countries, including China, release diluted tritium into the sea for decades without incident. “Nuclear power plants worldwide have routinely discharged water containing tritium for over 60 years without harm to people or the environment, most at higher levels than planned for Fukushima,” Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University, said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/07/morning-mail-dutton-goes-nuclear-tobacco-companys-surprise-vape-push-mitch-marsh-stars-in-ashes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T21:13:10Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: Dutton goes nuclear, tobacco company’s surprise vape push, Mitch Marsh stars in Ashes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/morning-mail-dutton-goes-nuclear-tobacco-companys-surprise-vape-push-mitch-marsh-stars-in-ashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/morning-mail-dutton-goes-nuclear-tobacco-companys-surprise-vape-push-mitch-marsh-stars-in-ashes","fields":{"bodyText":"Morning everyone.

The agency’s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Last week Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was plotting a “terrorist attack”. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. The intelligence agency named three senior individuals – the plant’s chief inspector, the head of the legal department and the deputy in charge of supplies – who had already departed. It said the number of Russian soldiers at the station and in the nearby town of Enerhodar had been reduced. Since seizing the plant last year, the Russian army has turned it into a military base. It moved hardware into the turbine halls, including armoured vehicles and ammunition. Soldiers used the territory to bombard Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. This has mostly dried up after the Kakhovka dam downstream was blown up this month. Western governments and Kyiv say Russia deliberately sabotaged the dam to impede Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Former plant workers told the Guardian it would be difficult to damage the reactors, which were protected by thick steel and concrete. But they said the small cooling pond – which the Russians have allegedly mined – was more vulnerable, as was a dry storage area used for spent nuclear fuel. An explosion in the cooling pond could lead to a partial nuclear meltdown similar to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US state of Pennsylvania, Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer, said. In this scenario, most radiation would be contained. But he added: “Of course, if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels this would throw out radiation.” Kovynyev said the dry storage area at the plant contained 24 spent “fuel assemblies”, sealed in 120 “hermetic” steel casks. “In a normal situation, they are absolutely safe. If you wanted, you could destroy them. You could shell several times. This could cause a nuclear accident with radiation release.” He said he remained optimistic no disaster would take place. Before the full-scale invasion, the plant employed 11,500 workers. An estimated 2,500 remain. Some, including the plant’s Ukrainian director, have signed contracts with Rosatom. Others have refused and have had their security passes revoked. Staff currently receive salaries from both Russia and Ukraine. The GUR said on Friday that personnel remaining at the station had been instructed to “blame Ukraine in case of any emergencies”. Russia has claimed Kyiv has endangered the station by shelling it. Ukraine has urged the international community to pay attention to the situation at the plant and to put pressure on Moscow to step back from the brink. Officials point out that Zelenskiy warned last year the Kremlin was preparing to blow up the Kakhovka dam – something that happened seven months later. The chief rabbi of Ukraine, Moshe Azman, warned the “entire world community” to do everything in its power to stop a possible catastrophe. This week Russia told the UN security council it had no plans to blow up the plant. It previously assured the council it would not invade Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T17:50:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia situation ‘tense’ as both sides accuse each other of planning attack on nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is coming up to 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning to attack one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants, which is located in southeastern Ukraine and occupied by Russian troops, but neither side provided evidence to support their claims. Citing intelligence reports, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian troops had placed “objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The objects could be used to “simulate” an attack, he said, meaning a false flag attack, AP reported. A man who detonated explosives in a court house in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday has died, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said. Klymenko, in a statement at the site of the explosion at the Shevchenkivskyi court house said the man may have stepped inadvertently on explosives. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, and Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, joined with their Polish counterparts Zbigniew Rau and Mariusz Blaszczak at a pre-Nato summit meeting in London on Wednesday and followed it up with a press conference. The two countries are ruled by right-leaning parties, and each emphasised their mutual agreement on defence and foreign policy ahead of next week’s Nato meeting where the key topic will be Ukraine’s demand for concrete steps towards membership whenever its war with Russia ends. The United Nations is making “every effort” to ensure that the Black Sea grain deal and a memorandum of understanding to facilitate access of Russian fertiliser and other products to global markets are extended, UN trade chief Rebeca Grynspan said. “We need both to continue bringing down prices and have stable markets of food and fertilisers in the world,” Grynspan told reporters in Geneva. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russian forces had struck three Ukrainian army groups near Bakhmut, amid conflicting reports about fighting in the area. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield situation. The ministry made no comment in its daily briefing on reports that Russian forces have retreated from the village of Klishchiivka, south-west of Bakhmut, which a Russian-installed official in eastern Ukraine has denied. Vladimir Rogov, one of the prominent pro-Russian figures in occupied Zaporizhzhia region has reported on his Telegram account that “the houses of local residents, a garage and a car were damaged” in the region due to Ukrainian fire. He said there were no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s former election spokesperson has been appointed to run the state news agency Tass, according to a government order published on Wednesday. The Kremlin has tightened its control over the media since the start of the Ukraine war, forcing the closure of leading independent news outlets and designating many journalists and publications as “foreign agents”, Reuters reported. Next week’s Nato summit must offer “real security guarantees” to Ukraine, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said today. Speaking in Warsaw alongside the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, Meloni said Italy and Poland were “in perfect agreement” on the issue, Reuters reported. Russia accused a small US based charity of “sabotaging” the construction of a huge gas pipeline to China and banned it as an “undesirable organisation”. Jennifer Castner, director of the Altai Project, described the accusation as absurd but said it had been only a matter of time. The move followed clamp-downs on many foreign NGOs in Russia, including a similar ban last month on the local arm of the WWF environmental group. Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of about 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. A man who detonated explosives in a court house in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday has died, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said. Klymenko, in a statement at the site of the explosion at the Shevchenkivskyi court house said the man may have stepped inadvertently on explosives. Russia accused a small US based charity of “sabotaging” the construction of a huge gas pipeline to China and banned it as an “undesirable organisation”. Jennifer Castner, director of the Altai Project, described the accusation as absurd but said it had been only a matter of time. The move followed clamp-downs on many foreign NGOs in Russia, including a similar ban last month on the local arm of the WWF environmental group. The Russian prosecutor general’s office said that while claiming to advocate nature conservation, the Altai Project was meddling in Russia’s internal affairs and could damage its economic security. “The key direction of the organisation’s work is sabotaging the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline,” it said. The planned pipeline is intended to deliver 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year from Russia to China via Mongolia. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, and Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, joined with their Polish counterparts Zbigniew Rau and Mariusz Blaszczak at a pre-Nato summit meeting in London on Wednesday and followed it up with a press conference. The two countries are ruled by right-leaning parties, and each emphasised their mutual agreement on defence and foreign policy ahead of next week’s Nato meeting where the key topic will be Ukraine’s demand for concrete steps towards membership whenever its war with Russia ends. Polish foreign minister Rau said “we have no doubt that at this summit Ukraine will become instituationally closer to Nato” and emphasised that Warsaw would help Ukraine align its political and military structures to alliance standards. Cleverly was more cautious and said that the way Ukraine had modernised its military during the war will have shortened the eventual timescale by which it can join: The process by which Sweden and Finland applied was a truncated one. I think we should reflect on that when we discuss what process there will be for Ukraine to join. Ukrainian police said on Wednesday they were investigating a reported explosion in a district court in the capital Kyiv. Police said on the Telegram messaging app that officers and other experts were at the site. It quoted preliminary information that a device had been detonated by a man who had been taken to a court hearing. Experts from the UN nuclear watchdog based at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have yet to observe any indications of mines or explosives at the plant, but more access is needed to be sure, the agency said. “The IAEA experts have requested additional access that is necessary to confirm the absence of mines or explosives,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. “In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant.” The UK has signed a new partnership with Poland aimed at deepening foreign policy and defence cooperation. Foreign secretary James Cleverly and defence secretary Ben Wallace alongside Polish national defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak agreed joint priorities on issues including Belarus and China, PA reported. The Ministry of Defence said the new 2030 Strategic Partnership signed at Lancaster House on Wednesday builds on the 2017 UK-Poland treaty, which provided a framework for enhanced cooperation between the two Nato allies. At a meeting before the signing, the ministers discussed support for Ukraine and defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. Cleverly said: Just as the UK and Poland fought together to preserve freedom in Europe during World War Two, so today the UK and Poland are standing together once more, at the forefront of international support for Ukraine. Our 2030 Partnership commits the UK and Poland to even greater defence, security and foreign policy cooperation into the future. Wallace said: As historic defence partners and Nato Allies, the UK stands with Poland to defend Nato’s Eastern Flank and support Ukraine against Russian aggression. The 2030 Strategic Partnership strengthens our commitment to develop closer military deployments and exercises and deliver on immediate and long-term capability projects. Pjotr Sauer and Jason Burke report on the fate of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s business interests in Russia – including the notorious troll farm: As Wagner mercenaries captured a major Russian military base and began their armed march on Moscow, members of Russia’s federal security services stormed one of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s headquarters in St Petersburg. Masked men quickly seized computers and documents belonging to the Patriot group, a media holding at the heart of Prigozhin’s information empire that for years promoted the warlord at home while sowing chaos and interfering with elections abroad. “They barged in, smashing the front door. It felt like they were busting a brothel, and not the workplaces of patriotic journalists,” said a senior staffer at Ria Fan, the flagship Patriot online outlet, who was present during the search. The incident on 24 June, described to the Guardian by several Patriot members, marked the start of the Kremlin’s efforts to clamp down on Prigozhin’s vast business empire, after a mutiny that presented the biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin’s 23 years in power. Over three decades, Prigozhin built one of the world’s most shadowy and complex corporate structures that stretched far beyond his mercenary activities and included companies in media, logistics, mining, film and catering – for which he earned his nickname as Vladimir Putin’s chef. Read more here: ‘He lived by the troll, he dies by the troll’ – Putin takes on Prigozhin’s business empire Vladimir Rogov, one of the prominent pro-Russian figures in occupied Zaporizhzhia region has reported on his Telegram account that “the houses of local residents, a garage and a car were damaged” in the region due to Ukrainian fire. He said there were no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, spoke by phone with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and discussed the Black Sea grain deal, a Turkish foreign ministry source said on Wednesday. Fidan also discussed Nato enlargement with Blinken, the source told Reuters. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning to attack one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants, which is located in southeastern Ukraine and occupied by Russian troops, but neither side provided evidence to support their claims. Citing intelligence reports, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian troops had placed “objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The objects could be used to “simulate” an attack, he said, meaning a false flag attack, AP reported. A statement from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said the “foreign objects” were placed on the outer roof of the plant’s third and fourth power units. “Their detonation should not damage power units but may create a picture of shelling from Ukraine,” the statement said. In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov raised the spectre of a potentially “catastrophic” provocation by the Ukrainian army at the nuclear plant, which is Europe’s largest but has its six reactors shut down. “The situation is quite tense. There is a great threat of sabotage by the Kyiv regime, which can be catastrophic in its consequences,” Peskov said in response to a reporter’s question. He also claimed that Kremlin is taking “all measures” to counter the alleged Ukrainian threat. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russian forces had struck three Ukrainian army groups near Bakhmut, amid conflicting reports about fighting in the area. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield situation. The ministry made no comment in its daily briefing on reports that Russian forces have retreated from the village of Klishchiivka, south-west of Bakhmut, which a Russian-installed official in eastern Ukraine has denied. Ukraine has said its forces had “partial success” in the Klishchiivka area. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s former election spokesperson has been appointed to run the state news agency Tass, according to a government order published on Wednesday. The Kremlin has tightened its control over the media since the start of the Ukraine war, forcing the closure of leading independent news outlets and designating many journalists and publications as “foreign agents”, Reuters reported. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, signed an order dismissing Sergei Mikhailov as general director of Tass and appointing Andrei Kondrashov in his place. Mikhailov had served as general director since 2012. Kondrashov, 50, is a state television journalist who in 2018 worked as the press secretary of Putin’s election headquarters. The United Nations is making “every effort” to ensure that the Black Sea grain deal and a memorandum of understanding to facilitate access of Russian fertiliser and other products to global markets are extended, UN trade chief Rebeca Grynspan said. “We need both to continue bringing down prices and have stable markets of food and fertilisers in the world,” Grynspan told reporters in Geneva. “The United Nations remains committed to making every effort for the continuation of the agreements.” Next week’s Nato summit must offer “real security guarantees” to Ukraine, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said today. Speaking in Warsaw alongside the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, Meloni said Italy and Poland were “in perfect agreement” on the issue, Reuters reported. Nato leaders are meeting in Vilnius on 11-12 July. Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Fears over the safety risks for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, have been constant throughout Russia’s invasion, but increased in early June after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the source of cooling water for its reactors. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. He added: “The world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else.” Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. “Forty-one people have been injured due to the shelling, including two children. One person has died from their wounds,” Vladislav Klyucharov, the Russian-appointed head of the city’s administration said on Russia’s state-run broadcaster Rossiya-24, according to AFP. Earlier the Russian-installed leader of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian forces had launched “fierce attacks” on residential areas and a hospital complex in the city. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Images have been released from Russia that claim to show the damage in the Belgorod region hit by cross-border strikes from Ukraine. Air alerts have been declared across most southern and eastern regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force has warned of a missile danger in the south of Ukraine, alerting on “probable launches of Kalibr cruise missiles”, according to Suspilne. More details soon … Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow, Reuters reports. Milashina had her head shaved, fingers broken and green dye thrown over her while on her way to Grozny. Alexei Venediktov, the former head of the closed Ekho Moskvy radio station, said in a message on Telegram that Milashina and the lawyer Alexander Nemov – who was also attacked – were now in a Moscow hospital. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. The claims have not been independently verified. An air alert has been declared in Kherson region. This is not an uncommon event, as the line of contact in the region runs along the Dnipro River, with Ukraine holding the northern portion of the oblast on the right bank, and Russian forces occupying the southern portion of Kherson on the left bank. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine the Russian Federation has claimed to annex despite not fully controlling the territory. The UK ambassador to Ukraine has said “things don’t feel calm” in Kyiv despite the capital of Ukraine going without attacks for several days. In a post to social media, Melinda Simmons said: “In spite of Russia directing their murderous missiles at smaller Ukrainian towns with less air defence leaving Kyiv alone for now, things don’t feel calm.” Accompanied by a picture of the cathedral through trees, she added: “I walked over to peek at Andriivsky Cathedral through the trees. Never fails to bring balance.” Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, has reported that, in the last 24 hours, four settlements in the district came under fire, causing damage to houses and farm buildings. No injuries or casualties were reported. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. A woman has been wounded in the attacks on Belgorod, Reuters reports. “The attack on the town of Valuyiki lasted for more than an hour,” Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. A woman suffered shrapnel wounds to her chest. Gladkov said that Russian defence forces shot down three air objects, including one drone. Ukraine forces also fired 12 times from the Grad rocket launchers, he added. At least eight private houses were damaged in the attacks. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. “The town of Valuyki is under fire from Ukraine‘s armed forces,” Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app at 07:36am local time (0436 GMT). He did not specify whether it was rocket fire, artillery shelling or some other form of attack. “Air defence system worked, but there is destruction on the ground,” Gladkov said. Separately, Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, north of Belgorod and also bordering Ukraine, said that a school and a private house were damaged when the village of Tyotkino came fire, again without specifying the form of attack. Neither the Guardian nor Reuters have independently verified the reports. Zelenskiy has again warned Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Zelenskiy said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the power plant that is currently held by Russia. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskiy briefed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Russia’s “dangerous provocations” at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. He said he and Macron had “agreed keep the situation under maximum control together with the IAEA”, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Zelenskiy’s warnings echo comments he made last week at a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy said at the time. Ukraine’s military said it had destroyed a Russian “formation” in Russian-controlled Makiivka in the frontline Donetsk region, where Moscow-installed officials and media said one civilian was killed and dozens wounded in attacks by Kyiv. “As a result of the effective fire impact of the units of the defence forces, another formation of Russian terrorists in the temporarily occupied Makiivka ceased to exist,” Ukraine‘s armed forces said in a statement late Tuesday. A video accompanying the post showed a huge explosion lighting up the night sky and the silhouette of at least one building. It did not give further details. The Russian-installed head of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian forces had launched “fierce attacks” on residential areas and a hospital complex in Makiivka, AFP reports. A Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces has been “particularly fruitful” in the past few days and Ukraine’s troops are fulfilling their main tasks, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine‘s National Security and Defence Council said on Tuesday. Moscow has not acknowledged Ukraine’s gains. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Maliar, also reported gains around the shattered city of Bakhmut despite fierce Russian resistance, Reuters reports. Russian forces had captured it in May after 10 months of battles. “At this stage of active hostilities, Ukraine’s Defense Forces are fulfilling the number one task: the maximum destruction of manpower, equipment, fuel depots, military vehicles, command posts, artillery and air defense forces of the Russian army,” Danilov, head of Ukraine‘s National Security and Defence Council, wrote on Twitter. “The last few days have been particularly fruitful,” he said, without providing any details from the battlefield. Valeriy Shershen, spokesperson for the Tavria, or southern, military command, said Ukrainian troops had advanced by up to 2 km (1.2 miles) in the Berdiansk direction of southern Ukraine, despite fierce Russian resistance. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. A Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces has been “particularly fruitful“ in the past few days and Ukraine’s troops are fulfilling their main tasks, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said on Tuesday. More on this shortly. Other key recent developments: Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that 185,000 new recruits had joined the Russian army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year. In a video posted on Telegram, Medvedev, who was earlier this year appointed to a role overseeing Russia’s domestic military production, said that almost 10,000 new recruits had joined up in the last week. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has said it was lending €25m (£21.4m) to the Ukrainian city of Dnipro to help it cope with an influx of people fleeing fighting. It said the loan would help ensure the continuous provision of vital municipal services in the south-eastern city after the arrival of people forced to flee other locations because of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Reuters reported. US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday welcomed Nato’s decision to extend secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s term by a further year. “With his steady leadership, experience, and judgment, secretary general Stoltenberg has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since the second world war,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. The Kremlin has said there were “certain contacts” with the United States over the case of detained Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, but that it did not want to make them public. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made the comments in a regular briefing. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive. Switzerland plans to take part in a Europe-wide air defence project initiated in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Tuesday that the body’s latest safety review of the planned discharge “makes the science of the treated water release clear for the international community and it answers the technical questions related to safety that have been raised”. The report said discharging the water would have “a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment”. “This is a very special night today,” Grossi told the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, before handing him a blue folder containing the final report. Kishida said Japan would “continue to provide explanations to the Japanese people and to the international community in a sincere manner based on scientific evidence and with high level of transparency”. Grossi later said the document was “neither a recommendation nor an endorsement” of the water release plans drawn up by Japan’s government and the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). In a tweet, he said the IAEA would “continue our impartial, independent and objective safety review during and after the discharge phase”, adding that agency experts would “have a continuous on-site presence”. The end of the two-year safety review brings Japan closer to the start of the long operation to pump the treated water – a mixture of groundwater, rain that seeps into the area, and water used for cooling damaged nuclear fuel – into the Pacific Ocean. It is not clear when that process will begin, although there is speculation that it could be this summer. About 1.3m tonnes of water stored in huge tanks on the site has been filtered through Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system (Alps) to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The “treated” water – Japanese officials object to the use of the word “contaminated” – will be diluted with seawater so that the concentration of tritium is well below internationally approved levels before being released into the ocean 1km from the shoreline via an undersea tunnel. The water – enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools - becomes contaminated when it is used to cool fuel rods that melted after the plant was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The disaster triggered a triple meltdown, in the world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. Discharging the water is expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete, pending the IAEA’s review and official approval from Japan’s nuclear regulatory body, which could come as early as this week. Attempts by Japanese government officials to win regional support for the plan have had limited success. China, which denounced the plan as “extremely irresponsible” when it was announced in 2021, reiterated its opposition on Tuesday, calling for the discharge to be suspended. Through its embassy in Japan, China said the IAEA’s report should not be interpreted as a “pass” for the water release. Last week, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry said Beijing urged Japan to “take seriously both international and domestic concerns, stop forcibly proceeding with its ocean discharge plan” and “subject itself to rigorous international oversight”. Japan’s foreign ministry has said that it made multiple and repeated attempts to explain the science behind Tokyo’s stance to Beijing officials, but that its offers had been ignored. Local Japanese fishing communities have also objected to the plan, saying it would destroy more than a decade of work rebuilding their industry, with shoppers likely to shun their catch and send prices plummeting. Fukushima authorities have introduced some of the world’s strictest radiation testing regimes, but many consumers are yet to be reassured that fish and other produce from the region are safe. The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts from the water release will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. Tritium is considered to be relatively harmless because it does not emit enough energy to penetrate human skin. But when ingested – via seafood, for example – it can raise cancer risks, a Scientific American article said in 2014. The IAEA says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. After visiting Fukushima Daichi on Wednesday, Grossi will travel to South Korea, where some people have been panic-buying sea salt over fears of contamination after the discharge begins. Grossi is also expected to visit New Zealand and the Cook Islands in an effort to ease concerns over the plan, according to media reports. • Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T05:38:03Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Korea’s nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has said North Korea intends to have the world’s most powerful nuclear force as the leader was again pictured with his daughter while inspecting troops and an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s “ultimate goal is to possess the world’s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the century”, Kim said in an order promoting dozens of military officers involved in the launch last weekend of a new ballistic missile, state media reported on Sunday. He described the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as the “world’s strongest strategic weapon” and said it demonstrated North Korea’s resolve and ability to eventually build the world’s strongest army, which would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people. State media also showed Kim being accompanied on a military review by his daughter, whose existence had never been publicly confirmed before last weekend’s Hwasong-17 test. Ju Ae is estimated to be about 12 or 13 years of age, which means that in about four to five years she will be preparing to attend university or go into military service, Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said last week. State media news agency KCNA described her as Kim’s “most beloved” or “precious” child, a more honorific title than her previous description of Kim’s “beloved” child on its dispatch the previous week. Her second appearance will raise the prospect that leadership of the totalitarian state could pass to a fourth generation of Kims. Kim is believed to have as many as three children – two girls and a boy, experts said. Some observers believed one of those children was seen in footage of celebrations for a national holiday in September. In Sunday’s report, Kim was also quoted as saying North Korean scientists had made a “wonderful leap forward in the development of the technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles” and were expected to expand and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Kim was pictured in photos posing with scientists, engineers and military officials involved in the test. According to state media, those workers pledged to defend the “absolute authority” of the party and Kim, and vowed that “our missiles will fly vigorously only in the direction indicated” by Kim. Capable of reaching the US mainland, the launch of the Hwasong-17 on 19 November prompted the US to call for a United Nations security council presidential statement to hold North Korea accountable for its missile tests, which are banned by security council resolutions. North Korea’s powerful standing committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly awarded the Hwasong-17 missile the title of “DPRK hero and gold star medal and order of national flag 1st class”, state news agency KCNA reported in another statement, using the initials of the country’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “[The missile] clearly proved before the world that the DPRK is a full-fledged nuclear power capable of standing against the nuclear supremacy of the US imperialists and fully demonstrated its might as the most powerful ICBM state,” KCNA said.

Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but admitted that his forces had also been “badly damaged”. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, arrived at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday. He has described the situation there as very dangerous, and told Russian media outlets during the visit that “the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” The Danish energy agency says that an object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. The US has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, according to Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jul/09/nuclear-option-to-the-fore-as-tories-prepare-to-unveil-roadmap-to-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-08T23:05:28Z","webTitle":"Nuclear option to the fore as Tories prepare to unveil roadmap to net zero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/09/nuclear-option-to-the-fore-as-tories-prepare-to-unveil-roadmap-to-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jul/09/nuclear-option-to-the-fore-as-tories-prepare-to-unveil-roadmap-to-net-zero","fields":{"bodyText":"In London’s Science Museum sit full-size turbine engines that tell the story of 300 years of steam power. This week, the museum will play host to the government’s dreams for a new industrial renaissance – this time for nuclear energy. The secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Grant Shapps, has chosen the venue to set out his ambitions for the UK’s nuclear programme. He is expected to illuminate the path towards the government’s existing commitment to build 24 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity – the equivalent of a quarter of Britain’s total generating capacity – by 2050. The event, scheduled for Thursday, will also be the official launch of the arm’s-length government body that has the task of driving the delivery of new nuclear energy projects. The first priority of Great British Nuclear (GBN) will be in streamlining the government’s ambition for small modular nuclear reactors. These mini-reactors offer rare bright points of optimism in the government’s nuclear plans. The attempts to bring forward investment in traditionally sized reactors have yielded only the much-delayed and overbudget Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset so far. But mini-reactors present an opportunity to harness the benefits of modular manufacturing techniques to cut the costs of full-scale construction and speed up building times. The government considers nuclear power a crucial part of its ambition to reach its 2050 net zero emissions target and its highly ambitious 2035 target to cut carbon emissions from the electricity system. A new nuclear dawn should also create highly skilled engineering and manufacturing jobs. The hope is that GBN will be able to accelerate the rollout of the mini-reactors by operating one step removed from the political wrangling of Whitehall and Westminster. In turn, mini-reactors are expected to offer a cheaper alternative to traditional nuclear power plants and be quicker to build. It is paradoxical, then, that both plans have been heavily delayed by political upheaval in recent years. Under Boris Johnson, the government put nuclear power at the centre of its energy strategy, announced in April 2022, in response to climate concerns and a desire to ditch Russian gas. Each new government has given rise to new rows over the cost of supporting small modular reactors. The current government hopes to announce the first competition winners in the autumn. Industry sources are hopeful that Shapps may use his forthcoming speech to clarify how the competition will progress. Any clarification will be gladly received by executives at the jet-engines-to-nuclear-reactors company Rolls-Royce, which says that its small modular reactors could begin providing “stable, secure supplies of low-cost power” by the early 2030s. But Rolls-Royce is not alone. In the time that it has taken for the government to launch its competition, the marketplace for small modular reactors has become a little crowded. Hitachi has submitted a design for regulatory approval, while infrastructure group Balfour Beatty and Holtec, which manufactures components for power plants, have agreed to propose a Holtec design, with the support of Hyundai. Rolls-Royce is understood to be sanguine about the rising competition, and comfortable in the belief that it can offer a compelling and competitive nuclear option. Still, it cannot have escaped its notice that if there had been fewer delays in the first place, it might have enjoyed more of a head start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Germany at a crossroads: what a nuclear power station tells us about its energy dilemma","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/neckarwestheim-delay-phasing-out-nuclear-power-dividing-german-village","fields":{"bodyText":"On a slope above the river Neckar in south-west Germany, about 25 miles (40km) from Stuttgart, stands the village of Neckarwestheim, its red terracotta roofs surrounded by vineyards and farmers’ fields, with streets leading to a central market square. So far, so typical for a rural community in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. However, this settlement of 4,200 residents has one defining characteristic: it is located right next to one of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations. The challenges facing this picturesque village illustrate how the energy crisis is affecting Europe’s largest economy, as Russia’s weaponisation of the gas supply has complicated Germany’s planned transition away from nuclear. On a crisp, clear autumn day, clouds of steam rise from the Neckarwestheim nuclear plant’s pressurised water reactor, pale against the hill at whose feet it stands. For those prepared to live with a reactor as a neighbour, its arrival in the mid-70s heralded a golden age. The site’s first reactor stopped producing power in 2011, while the second has been operational since 1989. “Everyone’s dreams came true,” says Jochen Winkler, the mayor of Neckarwestheim, from his office overlooking the main square of the village, which will celebrate its 900th birthday in 2023. In more recent times, the village has flourished; its population has doubled over the four decades the power station has been there. Winkler reels off a list of the amenities enjoyed by residents, from a sports hall and a cultural centre to subsidised childcare and even, once upon a time, “welcome money” paid to the parents of newborns, all thanks to local business taxes collected from the power station. Its owner is EnBW – a majority state-owned and publicly traded energy company, whose name stands for Energy Baden-Württemberg. “We had an income equivalent to that of communities which are three or four times our size,” says Winkler. But this is coming to an end, and Neckarwestheim II is living on borrowed time, limiting the local authority’s largesse. Along with Germany’s two other remaining nuclear power stations, it was supposed to be turned off by the end of the year, undergoing the final stage of an 11-year phase-out process initiated by Angela Merkel’s government after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, the urgent need to ensure winter energy supply as Russia throttled flows of gas into Europe led the federal government in Berlin to grant a stay of execution. All three operating nuclear reactors – Neckarwestheim, Isar II in neighbouring Bavaria, and Emsland in the north-west close to the Dutch border – are now permitted to run until the middle of April next year. Neckarwestheim’s contribution to Germany’s electricity is not insignificant: it generated 11bn kWh of electricity in 2021. The reactor provides a sixth of the total electricity consumption in the industry-heavy state – home to significant manufacturing operations including several car plants – or two-thirds of the total electricity demand of the state’s 5m households. “People who are afraid of or have a problem with nuclear power don’t live here. New citizens who have a problem with it don’t move here,” says Winkler. That statement certainly holds for Melita Marinkovic, out walking her puppy with her 12-year-old son, who has just moved here from Ludwigsburg, 15 miles south. “If there was a problem with the reactor, they would also be affected in Ludwigsburg,” she says. Like many of her neighbours, she thinks it’s a shame the power plant is being turned off: “It’s a good source of clean energy.” Residents’ views contrast with prevailing public opinion in Germany, where the existing anti-nuclear movement gained prominence after the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, as fears grew about the risks of nuclear power. Despite Germany’s temporary extension, opponents and environmental groups continue their demonstrations. Sporting an anti-nuclear badge on his jumper, Frank Wagner, from the mid-Neckar federation of citizens’ action groups, fears the current nuclear extension is just the thin end of the wedge. “This step shows us that the dam has been breached, which makes it quite easy to say in the coming months, ‘Oh, we’ve still got an energy shortage, we need the nuclear power plants for longer,’” Wagner says. He is also concerned that no location has yet been found for the permanent storage of Germany’s nuclear waste; the discussions are expected to last nearly 30 years. Dr Andre Baumann, Baden-Württemberg’s undersecretary of state for the environment, climate and energy, insists that the April extension will be the last. The Green politician, whose party returned last year to national government as part of a three-way coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Free Democrats (FDP), is adamant that no new fuel rods will be bought for Neckarwestheim, which would be necessary to keeping it running beyond April. For some, April is too late. After a previous year’s safety check at the reactor revealed cracks in pressure generator heating pipes, two local people decided to take their complaint to court. Their case will be heard later this month. The reactor’s owner, EnBW, says the plant has a “very high level of safety, also in international comparisons”. It adds that a previous court ruling found there was no reason to intervene in the operations of the reactor. The state government, with responsibility for nuclear oversight, says it is also satisfied that the plant can run safely. Apologising for the cool temperature in his office – the environment ministry has set its thermostats to 19C – Baumann says: “We mustn’t forget what’s important. We have to continue saving energy. “We have to adapt our energy system for the future. That means renewables, renewables, renewables. The setup costs are considerably lower than for new nuclear, coal or gas plants.” But the Energiewende, or energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, of which Germany was an early adopter, appears to have stalled in recent years. Many complain that plans to transport more wind power generated in the blustery north to the energy-hungry industrial south hit obstacles as far back as 2014. While the phase-out of nuclear and fossil fuels has been planned for years, the war has forced national energy policy to swerve in the other direction. Germany is racing to finish five terminals to receive liquid natural gas (LNG), and last week signed a 15-year deal with Qatar to receive new flows of LNG from 2026. Coal also continues to play a role. A recent lack of wind has prompted Germany to burn more of it, accounting for 45% of all energy generation. This was up from 31% in the first half of 2022, according to official statistics, when almost half (49%) came from renewable sources. Some analysts are concerned that the final shutdown of nuclear, which accounted for 6% of total electricity generation in the first six months of the year, will also leave a gap. In Neckarwestheim, the authorities have developed two solar installations, but Winkler says the process of obtaining permits for new developments is lengthy and time-consuming. Dr Gottfried Kazenwadel’s is the fourth generation in his family to farm crops and grow wine nearby. The chair of the local agricultural association is generally in favour of the nuclear switch-off, and like many Germans, would prefer the country to accelerate the development of renewable energy. He jokes that the village’s name was often left off the packaging for local agricultural produce. “Neckarwestheim was always in the news,” he says, “especially when the second reactor was built, which wasn’t necessarily good for marketing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T14:27:18Z","webTitle":"‘Objects resembling explosives’ planted at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, says Kyiv","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"bodyText":"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has again claimed Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Zelenskiy said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the power plant that is currently held by Russia. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskiy briefed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Russia’s “dangerous provocations” at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. He said he and Macron had “agreed keep the situation under maximum control together with the IAEA”, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. On Wednesday, the IAEA said its experts based at the plant said they had not observed any indications of mines or explosives at the plant, but more access was needed to be sure. “The IAEA experts have requested additional access that is necessary to confirm the absence of mines or explosives,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. “In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant.” Zelenskiy’s warnings echo comments he made last week at a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy said at the time. Russian troops seized the station, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in February 2022. Each side has since regularly accused the other of shelling around the plant and risking a major nuclear mishap. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, which operates Russia’s nuclear network, said Ukraine planned to drop ammunition laced with nuclear waste transported from another of the country’s five nuclear stations on the plant. “Under cover of darkness overnight on 5 July the Ukrainian military will try to attack the Zaporizhzhia station using long-range precision equipment and kamikaze attack drones,” Russian news agencies quoted Karchaa as telling Russian television. He offered no evidence in support of the allegation. A statement issued by the Ukrainian armed forces on Tuesday, quoted “operational data” as saying that “explosive devices” had been placed on the roof of the station’s third and fourth reactors and an attack was possible “in the near future”. “If detonated, they would not damage the reactors but would create an image of shelling from the Ukrainian side,” the statement on Telegram said. It said the Ukrainian army stood “ready to act under any circumstances”. In his nightly video message, Zelenskiy said Russia was planning to “simulate an attack” on the plant. “But in any case, the world sees – and cannot fail to see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia. And no one else.” Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian military provided no evidence for their assertions. On Friday Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) claimed Moscow had approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four of the six power units, as well as a cooling pond. It also said that Russian troops were reducing their presence at the plant and that Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea. While the reactors would be difficult to damage, according to former plant workers who spoke to the Guardian, the small cooling pond is vulnerable to an explosion, which could cause partial nuclear meltdown comparable to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US. Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer, said that in this scenario, most radiation would be contained, but that if ventilation channels were opened, radiation could be released.

In justifying the expenditure on a 144-bed dormitory at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, the USAF told Congress the building was intended to “house the increase in enlisted personnel as the result of the potential surety mission”, which is jargon typically used by the Pentagon to refer to handling of nuclear weapons, according to experts. Construction of the dormitory is due to begin in June 2024 and last until February 2026, and is the latest in a series of signs that preparations are under way for the possible return of US nuclear weapons to UK territory. Matt Korda, of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), who first reported on the budget request, said: “The mention of the arrival of the potential surety mission caught my eye as that is a buzzword, a term commonly used in the defence department and the nuclear weapons complex to refer to the positive control of nuclear weapons in a safe and secure way.” The FAS previously reported that in the 2023 defence budget, the UK was added to the list of countries where infrastructure investment is under way on “special weapons” storage sites in Europe, alongside Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. The FAS estimates there are about 100 B61 gravity bombs in storage in those five countries. They were withdrawn from the UK in 2007, but the storage facilities for the bombs were mothballed rather than dismantled. US nuclear weapons were first based in the UK in 1954, notably at RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth, but also at RAF Lakenheath, which at one time had shelters to store as many as 110 air launched B61 nuclear bombs. Britain’s nuclear force is made up exclusively of submarine-launched Trident missiles, but the US maintains a “nuclear triad” of weapons that can be launched from the sea, air and land. While the US cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991, the gravity bombs were maintained at Lakenheath for at least another 16 years before their removal. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence said: “It remains a long-standing UK and Nato policy to neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at a given location.” If such weapons were based in the UK, it is likely they would remain under US military control. The campaign group CND called on the prime minister to refuse to allow the US to house nuclear weapons on British soil, once the upgrades to Lakenheath were completed. Kate Hudson, the organisation’s general secretary, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that Lakenheath is once again a vital cog in Washington’s overseas nuclear machine – despite refusals from the British government to acknowledge this reality.” She said their presence would make the UK a more likely target in any nuclear war. Concerns about nuclear conflict have been at their highest level for some years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In 2021, the UK announced it would lift its own stockpile of Trident nuclear warheads by 40% to 260, the first such increase since the end of the cold war and a reflection of increasing western anxiety over Russian intentions and growing Chinese capability. The B61 bombs were once considered obsolete by the US military, a relic of the cold war. But instead of being retired, they have been upgraded to extend their life and improve their accuracy. The new version, the B61-12, is expected to arrive in Europe this year. The new F-35A Lightning II fighters have been given certification to be armed with the modernised bombs, and the 495th Fighter Squadron, stationed at RAF Lakenheath, is due to become the first unit in Europe to receive the nuclear-capable planes. Last November, the C-17A Globemaster III military transport plane was approved to carry the B61-12 bombs, allowing it to distribute them to storage sites at bases in the US and Europe. “All of these things provide pretty significant evidence that it’s very possible that the nuclear mission could return to the UK,” Korda said. In an interview in December 2021, two months before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said: “We have no plans of stationing any nuclear weapons in any other countries than [those that] already have these nuclear weapons as part of our deterrence.” That statement does not necessarily exclude the UK, which previously hosted B61 bombs. It is not clear from the budget documents whether the UK is intended to become a permanent base for US nuclear weapons, or a contingency base in the event of a crisis. Another possibility is that when old versions of the B61 are withdrawn from Incirlik airbase in Turkey, they will not be replaced by B61-12s, because of longstanding concerns over the base’s proximity to the Syrian border and internal Turkish security after the attempted coup of 2016. In that case, the new bombs could be stationed in Lakenheath instead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jul/18/grants-of-157m-offered-in-support-of-uks-nuclear-power-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-17T23:01:40Z","webTitle":"Shapps announces £157m in grants at launch of new UK nuclear body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/18/grants-of-157m-offered-in-support-of-uks-nuclear-power-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jul/18/grants-of-157m-offered-in-support-of-uks-nuclear-power-industry","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government is to offer grants of £157m as part of its launch of a new body to support the nuclear power industry. Great British Nuclear (GBN) will be tasked with helping deliver the government’s commitment to provide a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear energy by 2050. The new body will help drive rapid expansion of nuclear power plants in the UK, boost energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, said the energy security secretary, Grant Shapps. It is hoped that a competition to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) will drive billions of pounds of investment into the technology, which the government hopes will be cheaper and quicker to build than traditional large nuclear power plants. However, environmental campaigners and academics have argued that SMRs have no track record and that time and resources would be better spent on renewables such as more offshore wind. The launch at the Science Museum in London on Tuesday was delayed from last week after it clashed with the government’s public sector pay deal announcement. The government’s previous attempts to attract funding for conventional large reactors have so far only yielded the much delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset. Shapps is expected to announce the winners of the competition in the autumn, with a number of manufacturing firms such as Rolls-Royce and Hitachi interested in developing SMRs. The government said it was still committed to Hinkley Point C and also Sizewell C, a nuclear power plant in Suffolk that was announced last year and has been backed with £700m of public funds. In addition to the competition launch, Shapps announced that up to £157m of grant funding would be available. There will be up to £77m to accelerate the development of a nuclear business in the UK and support new designs, and a further £58m for the development and design of a new advanced modular reactor that operates at higher temperatures. Shapps said: “Britain has a rich history as a pioneer of nuclear power, having launched the era of civil nuclear power, and I’m proud to be turbocharging its revival and placing our country once again at the forefront of global innovation. By rapidly boosting our homegrown supply of nuclear and other clean, reliable, and abundant energy, we will drive down bills for British homes and make sure the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like [Vladimir] Putin. “Today, as we open Great British Nuclear and the competition to develop cutting-edge small modular reactor technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, we are seeing the first brushstrokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come.” Dr Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, accused the government of “obsessing” over nuclear power and decried SMRs. “As the government tries to whip up investment for the latest generation of reactors, it is striking how many of the nuclear industry’s speculative claims are being repeated by ministers as fact,” he said. “The hype seems to have been enough to convince our government that nuclear’s last gasp is in fact a new dawn, but at their radioactive cores SMRs remain the same bad bet. “SMRs have no track record, but initial indications are that the familiar problems of cost overruns and delays will be repeated, and the accumulation of unmanageable waste will continue.” Parr added: “By continually obsessing about nuclear, the government is taking its eye off the net zero ball, which will have to be delivered through a predominantly renewable, modern electricity grid. No number of SMRs will fix the government’s lacklustre effort to address issues of delayed connections, smart local grids and home efficiency.” Steve Thomas, an emeritus professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: “Yet again, the British government has proved credulous to the claims of the nuclear industry that a new generation of technology will solve all the problems of its predecessors. “SMRs are a long way from being commercially ready and at best will be as uneconomic as existing technology and at worst won’t even be technically feasible. The answers to reaching net zero with electricity are already available – energy efficiency and renewables. This announcement will only divert time and resources from these.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/06/on-78th-anniversary-of-atomic-bomb-hiroshima-mayor-says-nuclear-deterrence-folly","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-06T06:40:39Z","webTitle":"Japan’s PM deplores ‘Russia’s nuclear threat’ on 78th anniversary of Hiroshima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/06/on-78th-anniversary-of-atomic-bomb-hiroshima-mayor-says-nuclear-deterrence-folly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/06/on-78th-anniversary-of-atomic-bomb-hiroshima-mayor-says-nuclear-deterrence-folly","fields":{"bodyText":"Japan’s prime minister has hit out at Russian threats to use nuclear weapons as the country marked the 78th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Around 140,000 people died in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and 74,000 in Nagasaki three days later, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on the two Japanese cities days before the end of World War II. “Japan, as the only nation to have suffered atomic bombings in war, will continue efforts towards a nuclear-free world,” said Fumio Kishida at a ceremony in Hiroshima on Sunday. “The path towards it is becoming increasingly difficult because of deepening divisions in the international community over nuclear disarmament and Russia’s nuclear threat.” Speaking at the ceremonies, the Hiroshima mayor urged the abolition of nuclear weapons and called the G7 leaders’ notion of nuclear deterrence a “folly”. On Sunday a peace bell tolled at 8.15am, the time the bomb was dropped. About 50,000 participants in the outdoor memorial ceremony including ageing survivors observed a moment of silence, with the summer heat hitting 30C (86F). The day to commemorate the victims of the world’s first nuclear attack comes as Russian officials have talked about using nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Western authorities have said there is no evidence of Russia preparing such an attack. “Leaders around the world must confront the reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain policymakers reveal the folly of nuclear deterrence theory,” said the Hiroshima mayor, Kazumi Matsui. The ceremony was also attended by Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, who said the road to a world without nuclear weapons was getting steeper due in part to Russia’s nuclear threats, but this made it all the more important to bring back international momentum towards that goal. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, expressed his support. “World leaders have visited this city, seen its monuments, spoken with its brave survivors, and emerged emboldened to take up the cause of nuclear disarmament,” he said in remarks read by a UN representative. “More should do so, because the drums of nuclear war are beating once again.” The bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, nicknamed Little Boy, killed thousands instantly and about 140,000 by the end of the year. Japan surrendered on 15 August.

But this idyllic Pacific scene hides a dark secret: it was the location of 67 nuclear detonations as part of US military tests during the cold war between 1946 and 1958. The bombs were exploded above ground and underwater on Bikini and Enewetak Atolls, including one device 1,100 times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. Chernobyl-like levels of radiation forced hundreds from their homes. Bikini Atoll remains deserted. At the US government’s urging, residents have begun returning slowly to Enewetak. Today, there is little visible evidence of the tests on the islands except for a 115-metre (377ft)-wide cement dome that locals nickname the Tomb – for good reason. Built in the late 1970s and now aged and cracking, the huge concrete lid on Runit Island covers more than 90,000 cubic metres (3.1m cubic ft) – or roughly 35 Olympic-sized swimming pools – of radioactive soil and nuclear waste. Unbeknown to the Marshallese people, the US shipped the waste from Nevada, where it was testing nuclear weapons on Native American land. The legacy of America’s nuclear testing on Indigenous communities both on the US mainland and its territories has come under renewed scrutiny with the release of Oppenheimer, the blockbuster film about the physicist who led development of the atomic bomb. Although his team tested the nuclear weapons on Native American land – there were 928 large-scale nuclear weapons tests in Nevada, Utah and Arizona during the cold war, dispersing huge clouds of radioactive material – the film never mentions the impact of the testing on the local Native Americans. “The film completely ignores the experiences of our people,” says Ian Zabarte, principal man of the Western Bands of the Shoshone Nation – who have been described as “the most bombed nation on earth”. Zabarte is attempting to forge connections with those Pacific Islanders who were similarly affected by nuclear testing. Earlier this year, he met representatives from the Marshall Islands when they visited Nevada to discuss the effects on their health from nuclear weapons testing. “The health impacts on our people have never been investigated,” Zabarte says. “We have never received an apology, let alone any kind of compensation.” Separately, a band of Marshallese activists are now sailing around the country’s 29 atolls, along with artists and climate scientists, on a 12-day tour that aims to raise awareness of nuclear testing on the archipelago. The 520-mile ocean voyage is being operated by Cape Farewell, a cultural programme founded by the British artist David Buckland and funded by the Waverley Street Foundation, Laurene Powell Jobs’s climate charity. “Cancers continue from generation to generation,” says Alson Kelen, a master navigator and community elder who grew up on Bikini Atoll and is joining the expedition. “If you ask anyone here if there’s a legacy of nuclear impact on their health, the answer would be yes. The Marshall Islands Nuclear Claim Tribunal has a list of cancers that are related to nuclear throughout our people. These cancers are hereditary.” The US maintains that the Marshall Islands are safe. It seized them from Japan in 1944, and eventually granted the islands independence in 1979, but the fledgling nation remained in “free association” with the US. Under this system, along with Micronesia and Palau, the Marshall Islands are self-governing but economically remain largely dependent on Washington, which also retains a military presence. Today it continues to use the US dollar, and American aid still represents a large percentage of its GDP. In 1988, an independent international tribunal was established to adjudicate between the two countries, and it later ordered the US to pay $2.3bn (£1.8bn) to the Marshall Islands in healthcare and resettlement costs. The US government has refused, arguing that its liabilities ended when it paid $600m in the 1990s. In 1998, the US stopped providing medical care for cancer-stricken islanders, leaving many in financial hardship. The agreement is up for renegotiation this year, and the Marshallese hope they will have stronger negotiating power with the US now that China is showing an interest in the islands due to their strategic location. The islanders are pushing for the $2.3bn they feel they are owed, and a cleanup of the Runit Dome, which is at risk of collapsing due to rising sea levels and the natural ageing of concrete structures. “Of course it’s going to break,” says Stephen Palumbi, a Stanford University marine scientist who led a research trip to the islands in 2016. “What else can you expect? You can’t just build something like that and walk away from it and expect it to stay there. You wouldn’t do that with your patio.” According to a 2019 investigation by the LA Times, many US military personnel present at the construction of Runit Dome realised that radioactive material was leaking from it, and would continue to do so – yet did not alert the Marshallese government. The threat to the Tomb is particularly acute because the islands, which lie just 2 metres above sea level on average, are very vulnerable to rising sea levels. The country’s capital, Majuro, is highly likely to be at risk of frequent flooding, according to a World Bank study. The US says it has discharged its responsibilities to the Marshall Islands, and because the dome is on Marshallese land, the onus is not on Washington to fix it. It is not clear what will happen to the environment when the Tomb crumbles, and has also been hard to track how the ecosystem has behaved over time as “there’s just not many people” on Bikini Atoll to even casually monitor changes, Palumbi says. But a 2012 United Nations report said the effects of radiation on the Marshall Islands are long-lasting and have caused “near-irreversible environmental contamination”. On Palumbi’s visit, locals warned his team not to eat the coconuts – which are radioactive due to the contaminated groundwater – or the coconut crabs that feed on them. “You do not grow crops, you do not eat coconut, you do not drink the water,” Palumbi says. In general, it has been shown that nuclear blasts represent an extreme threat to local biodiversity. A 1973 US government-funded study on nuclear testing in Alaska found both immediate harm and long-term damage to marine species: fish exploded when their gas-filled swim bladders reacted to the change in pressure underwater, and hundreds of sea otters were also killed instantly. Researchers have recently found that sea turtle shells can be used to study nuclear contamination, with traces of uranium found in animals not born when testing in the Pacific Islands ended. The turtles are thought to accumulate human-made radionuclides in their bony outer shell, which is usually made of keratin, through the food chain by eating uranium-contaminated algae. Japan recently announced it would start dumping waste from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which had meltdowns in 2011, into the ocean. Although the UN’s nuclear watchdog says it is safe to do so, there are fears that there is still not enough understanding of how radioactive nuclear waste affects the ecosystem to be sure of this. Palumbi notes that the resilience of the ocean is impressive, with corals regrowing on the Marshall Islands as soon as 10 years after the bombs were exploded. “This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life.” There are, however, eerie reminders of what happened decades ago, including a fine talcum powder-like sediment covering the reefs – and still-visible damage to the reef itself. “On the inside of the lagoon, where the actual bombs were, it’s still an amazing mess,” Palumbi says. “The reef has cracked in half, and you realise that it was the bomb.” Kelen says he would not trust anyone who says releasing nuclear material into the water is safe. “Everybody who has talked to me about nuclear has been lying,” he says. This, he says, includes the US “who promised our islands were safe to live in. This continues. I do not trust politicians who say this will be OK.” Zabarte, who has numerous family members who have died of cancer, is similarly concerned about the long-term impacts of radiation. “My people have nowhere to go,” he says. “We have to stay there, exposing ourselves on a daily basis. We have no choice.” “We have to keep repeating this story,” says Kelen. “We have forever been moved around by people who make decisions over us, telling us our lives will be safe and how to live. But no matter what life has thrown at us, from nuclear testing to rising sea levels, our home and life are very much still here. “We live this story, and it informs us culturally, but we do not let it define who we are.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
