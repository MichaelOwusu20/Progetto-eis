More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) said. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expects the three nuclear power plants will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. I’m closing the blog now for the day but it will reopen again tomorrow morning. Thanks again for following. The Financial Times has an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure and plunge it into darkness would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a “war of strength and resilience”. Pushing back against western fears of escalation, Ukraine’s president insisted there would be no lasting resolution to the war unless Russia withdrew from all the territories it was occupying. Moscow has stepped up a bombing campaign against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure since last month, hoping to force Kyiv to make concessions despite its advances on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said: We must return all lands . . . because I believe that the battlefield is the way when there is no diplomacy. If you can’t get your land back entirely, the war is simply frozen. It’s a question of time before it resumes. On Wednesday, Russia launched 70 missiles against infrastructure targets across Ukraine, leaving about 80 per cent of the country in the dark and without water. All 15 of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors were taken offline because electricity became unstable. Speaking in the presidential office, which was also out of water supply, Zelenskyy said: It was the kind of incident that hasn’t happened for I don’t know how many years, maybe 80, 90 years: a country on the European continent where there was totally no light. The state superbly fought back. Energy workers, the state emergencies’ ministry, deminers, everyone worked to fix and restore power and provide at least a bit of water. This is a war about strength, about resilience, it is about who stands stronger. Zelenskyy also appealed to Ukraine’s western partners to provide more air defence equipment to help protect critical infrastructure, as well as diesel supplies for emergency generators and additional gas to help offset power shortages. The president said the attacks targeting civilian infrastructure showed Moscow had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. Kyiv has been pushing back at perceived pressure to show its openness to an eventual negotiated solution to the war. Some western partners are concerned that any attempt by Ukraine to take back Crimea — annexed by Russia in 2014 and which it deems crucial for its security — could lead to a dangerous escalation by Moscow, possibly even the use of nuclear weapons. As Ukrainian forces have made advances against Russian troops in the south and east, Ukraine’s military aims have hardened: it is seeking the return of territory occupied since February and land occupied in the 2014 Russian assault. Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fate of Crimea was rising on the international agenda. I understand that everyone is confused by the situation and what will happen to Crimea. If someone is ready to offer us a way regarding the de-occupation of Crimea by non-military means, I will only be in favour. If the solution [does not involve] de-occupation and [Crimea] is part of the Russian Federation, no one should waste their time on this. It’s a waste of time. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has said. Reuters reports: The Hague-based organisation, created in the wake of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, opened an office in Kyiv in July to help Ukraine to document and track down missing people. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from their family members, or had died and had been buried in makeshift graves. The process of investigating the missing in Ukraine will last years even after fighting stops, Holliday told Reuters in an interview. The 15,000 figure is conservative when considering that in the port city of Mariupol alone authorities estimate as many as 25,000 people are either dead or missing. He said: The numbers are huge and the challenges that Ukraine faces are vast. Besides which they’re fighting an ongoing war as well against the Russian Federation. What is key now is setting in place all the correct measures to ensure that as many persons can be identified. The vast majority of missing persons, those deceased, are victims of war crimes, and the perpetrators need to be held responsible. By storing DNA samples on a database and seeking matches with relatives, the ICMP accounted for more than 27,000 out of 40,000 persons reported missing during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In Kyiv, the ICMP has started to collect DNA samples and is ramping up capacity for a multi-year process that will also help prosecutors build war crimes cases. The Guardian’s video team have published footage of medics at a hospital in the Ukrainian capital carrying out a cardiac operation on a child despite the city’s blackouts amid Russian missile strikes. According to Borys Todurov, the surgeon who filmed the operation, it was already under way when the electricity supply was suddenly cut. He said: This is how we perform heart surgery today. European Union governments remain split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with more talks possible on Friday if positions converge. Reuters reports: The EU states failed to reach a deal on the price level for Russian sea-borne oil on Wednesday because a Group of Seven nations (G7) proposal for a cap of $65-70 per barrel was seen as far to high by some and too low by others. The European Commission, the Czech EU presidency, the United States and G7 presidency Germany were all engaged in talks on Thursday to bridge differences and reach a deal before the price cap is due to come into force on 5 December. Diplomats said that six of the EU’s 27 countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7. Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit. Lithuania and Estonia back Poland. Cyprus, Greece and Malta, countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose most if Russian oil cargoes are obstructed, argue the cap is too low and want compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. One EU diplomat said: There are a lot of bilateral talks going on now at very high levels. There will be a meeting of representatives of all EU countries once there is progress. There is no point in calling another meeting if there is no change. The first reactor of Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant has been reconnected to the country’s power grid, regional governor Serhiy Hamaliy said. The Khmelnytskyi plant disconnected from Ukraine’s grid on Wednesday after Russian strikes on the country’s power system, Ukrainian officials said. Meanwhile, Russia’s Transneft said that pumping of oil through the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline had resumed at 6pm Moscow time, the TASS news agency reported, citing a company spokesperson. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Orban told a briefing after a meeting of the Visegrad Group in Slovakia that his government had already decided that Hungary would support Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato accession and that the country’s parliament would set this item on its agenda at its first session next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. US President Joe Biden has confirmed that a price cap on Russian oil being proposed by the United States and its western allies is “in play”, adding that he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the issue. He made his comments to reporters during a Thanksgiving holiday visit to a fire station on Nantucket Island. Reuters has the full detail on the prisoner of war swaps: Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow have confirmed. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured. Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said on Telegram that Ukraine received 48 soldiers and two officers, among them marines, infantrymen, border guards and members of the territorial defence. He said: We have managed to bring back 19 defenders of Mariupol ... as well as 15 prisoners (of war) from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and seven from Zmiiny Island. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed head of the part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region that is under Russian control, said earlier that a prisoner swap with Kyiv was taking place, involving 50 prisoners on each side. Kyiv and Moscow have so far swapped over 1,000 prisoners of war since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in February. The Ukraine Solidarity Project, a group of European and Ukrainian activists who target brands with ties to Russia, has unfurled a 400m2 banner outside energy drink company Red Bull’s headquarters in Salzburg depicting Vladimir Putin riding the company’s famous bull logo. The banner reads “Red Bull gives Putin wings” in reference to the company’s decision not to pull its products from Russian supermarkets. Red Bull was given a failing D grade by the Yale School of Management’s Russia business policy ranking for having postponed future planned investment and marketing while continuing “substantive business” in Russia. The Ukraine Solidarity Project said: It really matters that Red Bull is still on sale in Russia. It’s one of the world’s biggest brands and its decision to stick with Putin’s Russia is highly significant. Companies that sell their products there are paying taxes to the Kremlin and signalling that they’re comfortable with the illegal invasion of Ukraine. They need to pull out. As things stand, Red Bull gives Putin wings. Russia’s defence ministry has announced that Ukraine has released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured, in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides. Earlier today, the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said Russia would also release 50 captured Ukrainians. Romania is willing to continue supplying neighbouring Moldova with electricity as Russian shelling in Ukraine hits its energy supply, but insufficient interconnections are a challenge, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis has said. “Up until now we have delivered everything we were asked for,” Iohannis told reporters after meeting Lithuania’s president in Vilnius. “But outages happen because … Romanian-Moldovan interconnections are completely insufficient. Most of the power Romania is offering passes through Ukraine.” Romanian power producers started selling electricity to Moldova at a capped price in October, Reuters reported. Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said earlier this week the EU state was providing between 80% and 90% of Moldova’s electricity needs. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Russia’s attacks on civilian infrastructure are an intolerable, inhumane crime. Putin may plunge the people of Ukraine into cold and darkness with his missiles. He will never break their will for freedom and our support,” she added. A meeting of Nato foreign ministers is scheduled to take place in Bucharest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Reuters reported. A G7 foreign ministers meeting held in Germany earlier this month on Baerbock’s initiative focused on how to support Ukraine through the winter in the face of Russian attacks on its power grid. Ukrainian cities were plunged into darkness this week after a barrage of Russian missiles triggered one of the worst nationwide power outages of the war yet. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel said she had aimed to convene European talks with Vladimir Putin the year before his invasion of Ukraine but in the end did not see any possibility of influencing the Russian president at the end of her term. Merkel told the Spiegel news magazine in an interview published on Thursday that she and French president Emmanuel Macron had planned to hold an independent talk format with Putin within the European Council in 2021, her last summer in office. “But I no longer had the strength to push through because, after all, everyone knew: she’s leaving in autumn,” she said. Merkel, who retired from politics after 16 years in power following Germany’s September 2021 election, officially handed over the reins to Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats in December that year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden met the Russian leader in June 2021. Referring to her farewell visit to Moscow in August 2021, Merkel, who speaks fluent Russian, told Spiegel: The feeling was very clear: ‘In terms of power politics, you’re through.’ For Putin, only power counts. The leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic have publicly criticised Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, over the war in Ukraine. Reuters reports: Unity within the Visegrad Group, set up in 1991 as the region emerged from decades of communist rule, has been sorely tested by the war, with Orbán opposing harsher European sanctions on Russia including on energy supplies. By contrast, Hungary’s three Visegrad neighbours – which also include Slovakia – are among the EU’s toughest critics of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, said as he headed for a meeting of Visegrad leaders in Slovakia on Thursday: This is not the best of times for the (Visegrad) format, and Hungary’s different attitudes are significantly influencing and complicating the situation. I make no secret of the fact that the views of the Hungarian prime minister, some of which can even be described as provocative, do not help this cooperation to proceed as well as in the past. This week Orbán further annoyed his neighbours by wearing a scarf to a soccer match that depicted some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, prompting Kyiv to summon the Hungarian ambassador to lodge a protest. Fiala said on Wednesday the “Greater Hungary” scarf – which also showed territory now in Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia as part of Hungary – would be discussed at Thursday’s summit gathering in the Slovak city of Kosice. Poland, an ally of Hungary in their past disputes with the EU over the rule of law and human rights, has also turned more critical of Orbán because of his stance on Ukraine. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, criticised Hungary’s failure so far to ratify Sweden and Finland’s application to join Nato. He said: I will tell (Orbán) directly that for Poland this is one of the most important changes in international law, that is the accession of Finland and Sweden. We can’t allow the Visegrad Group to fall apart. It is a structure which protects the interests of our countries against other interest groups from western Europe. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief has said. Reuters reports that Petro Kotin, head of nuclear power company Energoatom, said the vast nuclear power station in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, which has been out of commission since September, had also been disconnected from the grid on Wednesday and became reliant on backup diesel generators. He added that the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since soon after Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago, had been reconnected to the grid by Thursday morning and that the backup generators were turned off. He said in a written statement: There is a real danger of a nuclear and radiation catastrophe being caused by firing on the entire territory of Ukraine with Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, and a huge risk of damage to nuclear plants. Russia must answer for this shameful crime. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Each side has blamed the other for shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant complex. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. In a broadcast clip circulating on social media for its controversial comments, Lukashenko said that “everything is in Ukraine’s hands now if they don’t want a huge number of people to die”. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Advisor to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Anton Gerashchenko, tweeted that this was “theatre of [the] absurd”. Hungary has obtained an exemption from the EU’s proposed Russian oil price cap during talks in Brussels, according to the country’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó. Szijjarto said at a briefing in Brussels broadcast on his Facebook page that the European Union’s current proposal says that oil deliveries though pipelines would be exempt from the price cap, which means it would not affect Hungary if the proposed cap is adopted later. A snap from Reuters suggests that Russia and Ukraine will each exchange 50 prisoners of war today, according to the Russian-installed leader in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, who posted on the Telegram messaging service. More details to follow. Russia does not plan to supply oil to countries supporting a price cap on Russian oil, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Ukraine’s leadership could “end suffering” in Ukraine by meeting Russia’s demands to resolve the conflict. Peskov was asked whether Russia was worried about the effect on the civilian population of its strikes on energy infrastructure, which have caused repeated mass blackouts. Peskov said Russia attacked targets of military, not “social”, relevance. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the next few hours. If there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line at rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Rachel Hall will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, initially said he received Germany’s offer with “satisfaction”. But following Russia’s heavy barrage of Ukraine on Wednesday, Polish leaders said it would be better if the defence systems were placed in western Ukraine. The head of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, called Germany’s offer “interesting” but said he believed “it would be best for Poland’s security if Germany handed the equipment to the Ukrainians, trained Ukrainian teams, with the caveat that the batteries would be placed in Ukraine’s west”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Warsaw, Vasyl Zvarych, thanked Błaszczak, saying on Twitter that Ukraine needs as many air defence weapons as it can get. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. “We are working hard to hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine and I can announce today that we are working full speed on a 9th sanctions package,” von der Leyen told a news conference. “And I’m confident that we will very soon approve a global price cap on Russian oil with the G7 and other major partners. We will not rest until Ukraine has prevailed over Putin and his unlawful and barbaric war,” she said. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Meanwhile, Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Reuters reported: The sources said the talks were being mediated by the Gulf Arab state and did not include the United Nations despite the UN’s central role in negotiating the ongoing initiative to export agricultural products from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Ammonia is used to make fertiliser. However, the talks aim to remove remaining obstacles in the initiative extended last week and ease global food shortages by unblocking Ukrainian and Russian exports, they added. The sources asked not to be named in order to freely discuss sensitive matters. The Russian and Ukrainian representatives travelled to the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on 17 November where they discussed allowing Russia to resume ammonia exports in exchange for a prisoner swap that would release a large number of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately establish what progress was made at the talks. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the plant, which both Ukraine and Moscow have accused each other of shelling, Reuters reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. “The government continues to be committed to take part in financial support to war-gripped Ukraine,” the government said in the decree. “So it calls on the finance minister to make sure to provide the €187m that would be Hungary’s share in the €18bn EU loan to be granted to Ukraine.” The decree, signed by Orbán, also says that the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, should start talks with Ukraine to work out an agreement needed for the financial assistance. To secure the funds for the loans, which Ukraine will have to repay within 35 years, the European Commission would borrow on the capital markets. However, proposals for the package will need to be approved by the European parliament and the EU’s 27 member states and Hungary said it would not take part in joint borrowing. Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. The temperature plunged below zero degrees Celsius overnight in a city that had 2.8 million residents before the war and where it is already snowing and the streets are icy, Reuters reported. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said electricians and repair workers were doing everything to get the power back on “as fast as possible” but the recovery would depend largely on the overall energy “balance” of the nationwide grid. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s staff, said power supplies had been restored in the Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia regions. In the south, the Mykolaiv region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim, appealed to Ukrainians to be as frugal as possible in their use of power. “Consumption has been growing this morning [which is logical], there isn’t enough capacity in the system to switch it on for more consumers!!,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “The energy system is united like we all are! If you’ve turned off a few unneeded lights, that’s really important!!!” Ukrainian servicemen shoot towards Russian positions on the frontline near Kherson, southern Ukraine. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Among those fighting the Russians in Bakhmut are a unit of Chechen fighters, who hope a Ukrainian victory could spark political crisis in Russia and bring down the powerful pro-Moscow leader of Chechnya. Further south, Russian forces were digging in on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, the general staff said, shelling areas on the west bank including the town of Kherson, which was recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I have the honor to inform you of the end of my mission as permanent delegate of the Russian Federation to Unesco,” Russian ambassador Alexander Kuznetsov said on Tuesday in a letter to the members of the World Heritage Committee obtained by AFP. The resignation will allow the committee to “quickly appoint a new president” and resume its activities, a UN diplomat told AFP. Russia’s position as chair of the committee had sparked an outcry among other members following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The committee had been due to meet in June in the Russian city of Kazan, but 46 countries, including France and the UK, boycotted the event. The meeting was supposed to update the landscapes, monuments and cities included in the body’s list of heritage sites. Unesco regulations dictate that replacements for a resigning committee chair are to be appointed by the country that follows in alphabetical order in English. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s energy ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops off nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger report from Kyiv: Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said: “It’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war. “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link: Hello, my name is Helen Sullivan and you’re reading the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations Security Council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror. This is all against our energy infrastructure... Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered,” Zelenskiy said via video link to the council chamber. At least 10 people were killed in the strikes, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said, including a two-day-old infant. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/10/ohio-election-issue-1-republicans-abortion-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T10:00:52Z","webTitle":"Ohio Republicans bet voters would dilute their own power. They lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/10/ohio-election-issue-1-republicans-abortion-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/10/ohio-election-issue-1-republicans-abortion-vote","fields":{"bodyText":"When Ohio Republicans decided to rush a constitutional amendment on to the statewide ballot this year, they made a big bet. They bet that turnout would be low in an election held in the middle of the summer (it was just 8% in last year’s August contest). They bet that voters in the state, which voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020, would willingly dilute their own political power, raising the threshold to pass constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. And they bet that voters would embrace such an idea knowing that a constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall would protect abortion rights. All three of those gambles backfired on Tuesday. Ohio voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, called Issue 1. Unofficial results show that more than 3 million people voted in the election, a 38% turnout that exceeded expectations. But beyond reproductive rights, the Ohio contest also signals the growing awareness of and backlash to efforts to change voting rules to benefit politicians. Protecting abortion access is extremely popular in the United States. Efforts that would make it harder to ensure abortion rights can help voters understand how Republican politicians are trying to tilt elections to thwart majority rule. “Those two issues are now conflated. They’re going to remain conflated,” said Sarah Walker, the policy and legal advocacy director at the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, a left-leaning group that works on ballot initiatives. “It looks like a power grab from politicians. It looks like a consolidation of power and an inability to listen to the majority-will of the voters.” The election result is a firm data point showing how reproductive rights continue to motivate voters in the wake of the supreme court’s decision last year overturning Roe v Wade. Since the decision, abortion rights have been on the ballot in seven states – the pro-choice position has prevailed in all of them. In Wisconsin, Democrats won a critical state supreme court seat earlier this year by building a campaign around protecting abortion and fighting gerrymandering. And in Michigan last year, voters overwhelmingly approved separate ballot initiatives supporting abortion rights and voting rights while flipping the state legislature to Democratic control. “As we’ve seen over and over again now since the Dobbs decision, abortion wins elections,” said Amanda Litman, the co-founder of Run for Something, a non-profit organization that focuses on down-ballot races. “There were points during the campaign for Issue 1 where the Republicans were trying to make the case this was about something other than abortion access, the impending election in November. People smelled the bullshit. And they made it quite clear.” In Ohio, the victory was especially significant given that Republicans in the state legislature have openly rebuffed the will of the voters recently. Last year, they ignored a constitutional amendment passed by voters in 2015 to end extreme partisan gerrymandering in the state legislature. They kept districts distorted to preserve their supermajority in the state legislature, and then used that majority to send Issue 1 to the ballot. Voters issued them a rebuke on Tuesday. Jen Miller, the president of the Ohio chapter of the League of Women Voters, said that the campaign against the initiative didn’t lean on abortion to convince voters. Instead, she said, organizers focused on how the stakes extended beyond abortion and emphasized neighbor-to-neighbor canvassing to educate people about significant changes in Ohio that had come through constitutional amendments. “We were not really talking about abortion in the field,” she said. “The League’s message was very clear that this was bigger than one issue, bigger than one party, bigger than one election. And people understood that.” Tom Bonier, the CEO of TargetSmart, a Democratic data firm, said early vote totals in Ohio offered a glimpse of who was turning out to vote (he was still waiting for full results to get a comprehensive picture of the electorate). Women accounted for 60% of those who voted early this year but did not vote in 2022 and there were also signs of increased turnout in the state among Black women and young voters, he said. “If you can get 3.1 million people out to vote in an August election in Ohio, on something that isn’t even directly voting on abortion rights, but is tangentially, it clearly speaks to the organizing and mobilizing power of the issue,” he said. The result in Ohio is unlikely to stop Republicans in the state or elsewhere from trying to make it harder to amend state constitutions. Republicans in Missouri are pushing a similar measure to raise the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment ahead of an expected referendum to protect abortion rights there. “I think you’ll probably see the question coming back,” Matt Huffman, the Republican president of the Ohio senate, said on Tuesday evening, according to Cleveland.com. Miller predicted that another effort to raise the amendment threshold in Ohio would not be successful. “I sincerely hope that last night’s victory is a cautionary tale to lawmakers and special interests who may consider other brazen power grabs in the future,” she said. “I don’t necessarily see an appetite to revisit that in any way. But if they do, they need to know that Issue 1 created a pan-partisan movement to defend voter rights in our democracy here in Ohio. And we’re ready.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/22/texas-tropical-storm-harold-rain-flood-warning","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T20:26:30Z","webTitle":"Thousands lose power as Texas braces for deluge from Tropical Storm Harold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/texas-tropical-storm-harold-rain-flood-warning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/texas-tropical-storm-harold-rain-flood-warning","fields":{"bodyText":"The skies began to darken over southern Texas on Tuesday as Tropical Storm Harold hurtled toward the state, just as California began cleanup from the historic storm system Hilary. Texas, still grappling with the effects of one of the hottest and driest summers on record, is now bracing for a deluge. As Harold continued on its westward trajectory after sweeping through the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters warned it could drop up to 7in of rain in some areas with risks of flash flooding. “Tropical storm force winds will accompany the system as it progresses inland, as well as rough surf along the coast,” the National Weather Service said in a discussion on Tuesday. The meteorologists added that as the system pushes into other areas of the south-west there may be “additional flash flooding concerns, especially near the more flood-prone slot canyons in Utah on Thursday”. About 1.3 million people were under a tropical storm warning due to Harold, as dangers from damaging gusts and downpours stretch across the south-east coast of Texas. The powerful system, which pushed ashore along Padre Island, Texas, at about 10am local time, also caused widespread outages in the area, leaving more than 35,000 homes and businesses without power on Tuesday afternoon, according to Poweroutage.us. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, deployed the state’s national guard, water rescue teams, and other emergency services as Harold hammered the state, encouraging Texans to heed all guidance from local officials managing response efforts. “Texas stands ready to deploy all available resources to south Texas as tropical storm conditions impact the region this week,” the governor said in a written statement issued on Monday night. Harold came as California is still cleaning up damage caused by Storm Hilary. Hilary, the first tropical storm to make landfall in southern California in 84 years, slammed the US west coast with record amounts of rain and intense winds that caused flooding and mudslides. Thousands were left without power as flooding downed power lines. One power outage at a Los Angeles hospital prompted the evacuation of at least 21 patients in critical condition to other facilities. The intense flooding and mud wrought by Hilary stranded many people in vehicles and videos on social media showcased the harrowing scenes of escape from cars trapped in flood waters. There were reports of at least 12 people at a senior living center who were rescued after being trapped in mud, and unhoused people in an encampment near the San Diego river who were saved from the rising waters on Monday as the storm surged on. There were no US deaths caused by or attributed to Hilary, Reuters reported, as the system moved north. Risks of flash flooding still lingered across the northern Great Basin and intermountain west on Tuesday, along with the threat of more thunderstorms, according to the NWS. Tropical storms are a rare event off the US west coast due, in part, to its relatively cool waters. But scientists have warned that events like this one could become more likely as the ocean and atmosphere continue to heat up due to human-caused climate change. There have already been 15 disasters causing at least $1bn in damages this year, a record. “We’re seeing just this increase in the number of severe weather events but not just in the number, but the severity of these events,” said Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-shinawatra-anger-and-anticipation-in-thailand-as-exiled-former-pm-expected-to-return","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T13:09:28Z","webTitle":"Thaksin Shinawatra jailed on return to Thailand as his party regains power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-shinawatra-anger-and-anticipation-in-thailand-as-exiled-former-pm-expected-to-return","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/22/thaksin-shinawatra-anger-and-anticipation-in-thailand-as-exiled-former-pm-expected-to-return","fields":{"bodyText":"Thailand’s populist former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has arrived in Bangkok after more than 15 years in exile as his party returned to government in a controversial pact with its military rivals that keeps reformists out of power. Thaksin – a hugely influential but also divisive politician – began an eight-year jail term on his return, though commentators have noted that his arrival in the country coincides with his party’s return to office and a backroom deal could allow him to escape a full sentence. Hours after his return, Srettha Thavisin from Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party secured enough support to become prime minister in a high-stakes parliamentary vote. He will form a government with pro-monarchy military-backed parties associated with the former generals who led the 2014 coup. The young, reformist Move Forward party promised to remove the military from politics and amend the country’s severe lese majesty law after winning an election in May, but it was blocked from forming a government by military-appointed senators. Thaksin arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday morning, placing a flower wreath and prostrating before a portrait of Thailand’s king and queen at the gate of the airport terminal. He wore a suit with a yellow lapel pin bearing a royal insignia, and appeared only briefly in front of the media, accompanied by his three children, before being driven to court and prison. Behind fencing outside the airport, crowds of mostly older supporters, unable to see Thaksin, cheered and shouted: “We love Thaksin.” One supporter, hearing the news he had arrived, said: “Our dream has come true.” Many had travelled overnight on long journeys, sharing vans with relatives and neighbours, so they could witness his return. The supreme court said Thaksin would serve eight years in prison, though there is widespread speculation he will avoid a full sentence. On Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Corrections said Thaksin had undergone a medical checkup and been found to have heart and lung problems, high blood pressure and spine problems. Thaksin is eligible to apply for a royal pardon during his first day in jail, in accordance with existing rules for convicts. When asked if Thaksin’s hair would be cut short, as is standard for prisoners, Ayuth Sintoppant, the director general of the corrections department, said there was no rush, but added: “If it’s long, we have to cut it following the rules. But it won’t be as short as other prisoners, we have to consider this respectfully for the elderly. He’s in a vulnerable group.” Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006 and has lived in exile to avoid legal charges that he has previously said are politically motivated, including a conviction in absentia for corruption. Thaksin’s youngest daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, posted on Facebook saying he was safe and had “entered the legal process”. Pheu Thai says its decision to form a coalition with its longstanding enemies, the military-aligned parties, was necessary in order to win enough support for Srettha to become prime minister and tackle important issues relating to livelihoods and the economy. Thailand has been stuck in deadlock for weeks after the pro-reform Move Forward was blocked from forming a governmentshieldsmonarchy, leaving Pheu Thai to lead a fresh effort. Srettha said he was honoured to be selected as prime minister after winning a parliamentary vote. “I will try my best to fulfil my duties … I will lift up the wellbeing of all Thai people,” he said. The deal with the military-backed parties has divided Thaksin’s supporters, angering those who say the party has abandoned its democratic principles while others were overjoyed at Thaksin’s return. His supporters had already begun gathering at the airport from Monday evening, dressed in red and hanging banners that read “Welcome people’s prime minister” and “PM Thaksin, the PM that stays in the people’s hearts for ever”. Sansuk Termsrisuk, 62, who spoke to the Guardian before her journey from her home in Nakhon Ratchasima, said she would bring chao kuay, a dessert consisting of black grass jelly in syrup, to give to Thaksin as a welcome gift. “This is the day I have been waiting for. When I talk about it I feel like I want to cry,” she said, adding that she believed that when Thaksin was in power, the economy was much better and she had everything she needed. By contrast, it was hard for her to make a living as a vendor. “I really want to see him, even if I only see his car that’s going to be enough for me,” she said. Thaksin first came to power as prime minister in 2001 and went on to build a loyal voter base in rural areas of the north and north-east of the country. Policies such as a universal healthcare scheme and a village fund programme to stimulate economic activity in rural areas made a concrete difference to people’s lives, and for years he was unbeatable at the ballot box. Yet he was strongly opposed by the military-royalist establishment, which viewed him as corrupt and of seeking to upstage the monarchy. The military seized power in a coup twice, while political parties associated with Thaksin were repeatedly dissolved, and prolonged street protests paralysed Bangkok. A deadly crackdown on Thaksin’s supporters by the army in 2010 left more than 90 people dead. For many of his supporters, it was unthinkable that Pheu Thai could join with military-linked rivals. “What were we fighting for?” said the activist Sombat Boonngam-anong. Dr Punchada Sirivunnabood, an associate politics professor at Mahidol University, said the political deal was unprecedented given the gulf in ideologies between the two sides and would ruin Pheu Thai in the next elections. Key party figures had promised during the election campaign they would not do a deal with the generals. Under election rules that were rewritten after the 2014 military coup, Srettha needed to secure majority support from both the lower house of 500 elected MPs and the 250 senators – who are unelected and were appointed by the military – to become prime minister. The military-aligned senate previously blocked the reformist Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat from becoming prime minister. Sombat said he believed Thaksin’s return was part of the political deal. He said he sympathised with Thaksin and his desire to return home, but added that “if you consider the damage to the country, [this deal] is not worth it.”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/22/womens-world-cup-2023-gesture-matildas-fan","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T02:00:32Z","webTitle":"One World Cup moment demonstrated the profound power of grace under pressure | Paddy Steinfort","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/22/womens-world-cup-2023-gesture-matildas-fan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/22/womens-world-cup-2023-gesture-matildas-fan","fields":{"bodyText":"The players lined up in the tunnel, each hand in hand with an adoring young fan by their side. Sounds of their excited chatter and the buzz of 80,000 fans just a few feet above blurred together. Cameras popped, speakers boomed, and I could barely hear my own thoughts. The 2023 Women’s World Cup is the biggest women’s sporting event in history, so those of us lucky enough to work at the coal face know it’s going to be a big show. The stakes were crystal clear for the host nation on this particular night in Melbourne: win, and move on to the knockout stages as planned; lose, and the story ends in ways that will leave permanent stains on career and character alike. And that’s not even mentioning the millions of dollars at stake. “Courage is grace under pressure,” rang the words of Ernest Hemingway. Little did I know I was about to see one of my favourite quotes play out in real time, in the most unexpected way. As the teams walked out for the ceremonies amid roars and pyrotechnics, something wasn’t going according to the script. Among all the noise and the lights, one of the mascots was acting a little different. His needs became more and more evident as the team lined up for the anthems. Eventually, his overstimulation was as obvious as the magnitude of the moment. But rather than ignoring the fan’s distress, the undeniable grace of these women took over. With everything on the line, and every reason to look away, instead they leaned in. They didn’t look for someone to help, someone with less on their plate. They didn’t frown, freeze or furrow their brows. Minutes before kick-off, on the most pivotal night of this team’s life, they showed grace. At first it was only the youngest player in the squad, Mary Fowler, who began comforting the boy, instinctively soothing his overloaded nervous system with calming talk and gentle touch. But soon other players joined in. They smiled at him when he faced the wrong way. They chuckled at the cheek of the youngster as he booed the opposing team. And when his energy overflowed at the end of the anthem, veteran defender Alanna Kennedy gave him a joyful hug. She even escorted him through the handshake line, much to the surprise of the highly regimented Fifa officials. Then finally, once he was safe back in the hands of the organisers, the team took to the field. When the dust has settled on the historic run of this iconic team, this is the moment I can look back on and say I knew we would be OK – not only on this night, but for this tournament, and beyond. The world knows the rest of the story from there. Along the way the Matildas have broken attendance records, destroyed norms for TV ratings, and ignited a nation in the process. All while dealing with more pressure – external and internal – than they’ve ever faced before. They’ve showed – not only in their results, but also in the way they’ve carried themselves – the profound power of grace under pressure. It’s unforgettable to those who are touched by it – in the flesh on the field, as fans in the stands, or watching the drama on TV in our own homes. “True character is revealed in the choices a human being makes under pressure,” the world-renowned screenwriter Robert McKee wrote. “The greater the pressure, the deeper the revelation.” This hasn’t been some Hollywood storyline though. This is real life – with real pressure and real consequences. Thankfully, these are some of the realest performers I’ve ever been blessed to work with, and they’ve changed reality, perhaps forever. As an experienced performance director, I’m supposed to model a poker face under pressure. Even more so in tournament mode with one of the most popular teams in Australia. But I caught myself both smiling and welling up with tears at the time, only minutes before kick-off. It turns out pride and awe make for a potent emotional cocktail. This moment highlights the unmistakable value of this transformational time in sport. In today’s fractured society, we need to witness more transcendent moments like this. Especially when the heroes represent something bigger than themselves. And judging by the number of messages from long lost friends, relatives and even strangers thanking us for what this means “for the future of my daughter”, as one put it, this is bigger than the game. This isn’t just a flowery idea from within the bubble of professional sports though – even the United Nations is on the record saying that women in sport has the power to change lives Seeing this movement come to life, on and off the pitch, has made me better. It makes us all better.

Guernica was bombed by Hitler’s air force on behalf of Franco’s far-right forces in the Spanish civil war. Picasso started his vast painting soon after seeing the news. It evokes reading a morning paper with mounting horror: there’s newsprint, a kitchen table. Unveiled in the Spanish Pavilion at the Paris International Expo, this jagged wreckage of a history painting toured to summon support for the cause. Jonathan Jones * * * Theatre Using verbatim interviews, After the Act (on at Edinburgh’s Traverse theatre until 27 August) tells the story of section 28, the legislation that prevented the “promotion” of homosexuality, thus creating an enduring atmosphere of silence and fear. Alongside the astonishing history, what struck me from the interviews Breach Theatre conducted was the shame still held by an interviewee who did not speak out when they could have. When one compares the anti-gay atmosphere that led to section 28 with today’s climate of anti-trans vitriol, where attackers in both cases use strikingly similar language, After the Act is not only a reminder of the past but a call to action for the present. Kate Wyver * * * Music Amid all the recent controversy around Matty Healy’s clumsy acts of LGBTQ+ solidarity at a Malaysian festival, it is easy to forget that, in 2018, his band, the 1975, released one of the most poignant singles of the decade. A millennial status update akin to Billy Joel’s We Didn’t Start the Fire, Love It If We Made It matches throbbing synths with a litany of damning headlines: climate change, racial violence, fake news. It’s a harrowing story, but also a call to arms: the only way to avoid societal collapse is to prop things up together. In the chorus and the wailing saxophone of the song’s conclusion, Healy seems hopeful that by facing the extent of our issues we may collectively forge some answers. Jenessa Williams * * * Book Ten years after the iniquities and unrest in industrial Manchester inspired Friedrich Engels to write his 1845 polemic The Condition of the Working Class in England, Elizabeth Gaskell cast a novelist’s gaze on the city in North and South. As well as describing the poverty and illness endured by millworkers, she explores the passions that lead them to band together and go on strike. “I just look forward to the chance of dying at my post sooner than yield. That’s what folk call fine and honourable in a soldier, and why not in a poor weaver-chap?” says union leader Nicholas Higgins. Gaskell is less strident than Engels (who isn’t?), but she does help her readers feel the need for change emotionally, as well as intellectually. Sam Jordison * * * Film A decade-long court battle that brought together Korean-American churchgoing elders and fiery free-spirited student activists – and contributed to the blossoming of an Asian-American political consciousness – is explored in sensitive and moving detail in documentary Free Chol Soo Lee. Released last year, the film looks at the case of Chol Soo Lee, who was wrongly convicted of a 1974 murder in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Investigative journalist KW Lee soon began digging into the conviction, and his reporting led to a movement to free the then 20-year-old that galvanised Asian communities across the globe. Salacious true-crime stories seem inescapable these days, but this film is refreshingly less interested in uncovering whodunnit, and more in showing the emotional burden of the US’s criminal justice system. The relationship between the two men, which evolves from journalist and interviewee to inextricably bound friends, forms the heart of the story.

The powerful storm, which the National Hurricane Center (NHC) called “an unprecedented event”, made landfall shortly after daybreak with 160mph gusts near Keaton Beach on Florida’s Gulf coast. Idalia grew from a tropical storm into a hurricane early on Tuesday, a day after passing west of Cuba, where it damaged homes and flooded villages. In Florida, it pushed inland a storm surge of up to 16ft, submerging the small coastal community of Steinhatchee and setting record high water levels across a wide area stretching 200 miles south to Tampa. The afternoon high tide was heightened by a rare blue “supermoon”. The hurricane turned deadly, officials said, when a 40-year-old motorist in Pasco county, north of Tampa, lost control of his vehicle and collided with a tree. Another 59-year-old man died further north in Gainesville, also while driving. Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, also warned of a catastrophic impact from the storm as he urged residents who had not heeded evacuation orders to shelter in place. Quickly deteriorating conditions, he told a pre-dawn press conference, would make it too dangerous for emergency crews to respond. “Don’t put your life at risk by doing anything dumb at this point,” he said. Casey DeSantis, the wife of Ron DeSantis, said a 100-year-old oak tree split open and toppled on to the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee, where she and their children were home, but that no one was injured. The storm had rapidly intensified overnight, fueled by the abnormally record hot waters in the Gulf. Studies have shown evidence that Atlantic hurricanes are becoming stronger and intensifying more rapidly due to these accelerants resulting from the climate crisis. More than 280,000 customers in Florida were without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, with a further 50,000 out in Georgia. Kevin Guthrie, Florida’s director of emergency management, said 15 tornado warnings were issued for affected counties. More than 40 school districts in Florida canceled classes, DeSantis said. Tampa airport closed to commercial operations with plans to reopen on Thursday. US airlines reported the cancelation of more than 850 flights Mandatory evacuation orders were issued in at least 28 of Florida’s 67 counties as of Tuesday night. Most of the state’s 21 million residents, and many in the adjacent states of Georgia and South Carolina, were under hurricane warnings and other storm-related advisories. State emergency declarations were issued in all three. Later on Wednesday, the hurricane moved across south-eastern Georgia, with flash and river flooding threats through Thursday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said. Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia, issued a state of emergency for the state that was set to last until 11.59pm on 8 September. “We are taking every precaution ahead of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall tomorrow, and I am taking this additional executive action to ensure state assets are ready to respond,” Kemp said on Tuesday ahead of Idalia. In Valdosta, Georgia, about 80 miles north-east of Tallahassee, emergency boat crews were carrying out rescues of residents trapped in homes, according to the city’s Facebook page. Cedric King, a businessman from coastal Brunswick, Georgia, just south of Savannah, was not going to take chances. “I packed up the family and headed north,” he said after a five-hour drive with his mother, wife and children. “We evacuated.” Meanwhile, Joe Biden addressed the hurricane, as well as the ongoing recovery efforts in Hawaii on Wednesday. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of a climate crisis any more. Just look around. Historic floods. I mean, historic floods. More intense droughts, extreme heat, significant wildfires have caused significant damage,” Biden said. He added that he had directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to redeploy resources, including up to 1,500 personnel and 900 coast guard personnel throughout the south-eastern states. Biden also spoke to the governors of the affected states and promised timely assistance. On Wednesday afternoon, the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said: “We should take politics out of any type of disaster we see that the American people are having to suffer or deal with … This is not about politics.” Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/aug/10/american-revolution-will-the-power-of-us-money-change-soccer-forever","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T08:00:49Z","webTitle":"American Revolution: will the power of US money change soccer forever?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/10/american-revolution-will-the-power-of-us-money-change-soccer-forever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/aug/10/american-revolution-will-the-power-of-us-money-change-soccer-forever","fields":{"bodyText":"From the curtains of rain at his unveiling to the flawless top-corner winner in the final minute of his debut off the bench and the video-game soccer on display in his first start in flamingo pink, Lionel Messi’s beginnings in Miami have seemed providential, almost biblical. Messi is not, of course, the first aging superstar to put himself out to pasture on the gentle greens of US soccer. Pelé set the precedent, and many will follow once Messi has gone. But to choose America now? In this economy? With Saudi Arabia’s gushing riches within reach, and the lure of nostalgia calling him back to Barcelona? Surely that says a lot. Or perhaps it says nothing. For every charitable reading of the Messi-provided tea leaves today, an opposite and proportionately negative interpretation also seems plausible: the downpour at Messi’s unveiling was proof of the idiocy of running a soccer league through the extremes of the American summer, the PlayStation skills Messi treated us to in his first MLS start was only possible thanks to Atlanta United’s Commodore 64 defending, and so on. But Messi is Messi, even at 36: an argument all to himself and a divinity in any league. The arrival on these shores of a player uniquely able to shape the game to his will seems to portend the creation of a new reality for American soccer. Is soccer now a “proper” American sport? Will Messi’s embrace of MLS, however opportunistically motivated by the promise of the millions to be made in streaming revenue it may be, catalyze America to finally take the next step and assume its place among the game’s global powers, as a country at last able to attract and compete with the world’s very best in the men’s game? Whether Messi will reshape the game in the US or merely adorn it remains to be seen. But whatever direction his MLS sojourn eventually takes, it plainly fits into a broader narrative arc. Like Messi, soccer’s global administrators are betting big on America: the US is set to host Copa América in 2024, the inaugural expanded format of the Club World Cup in 2025, and the men’s World Cup in 2026, giving soccer an unprecedented three-year stretch of prime-time exposure, through the least crowded part of the American sporting calendar, in the world’s biggest media market. Things look very different now to the way they did a few decades ago: the US lost its bid to host the 1986 World Cup after Fifa’s then-president João Havelange, dismissing America as “not ready for such an event”, instead threw his weight behind Mexico, “a real soccer country”. No longer is the US condescended to as some distant, irrelevant province of world soccer; increasingly, it’s seen as the sport’s future, the market that must be converted if the game is to maintain its global supremacy. Exactly what it means to “convert” America to soccer is a little less clear, though, and the ambiguity of the sport’s relationship to this country captures some of the uncertainty over its direction as serious money starts to pour into the game. Missteps are still, without question, being made at an administrative level: the reappointment of Gregg Berhalter after last year’s World Cup feels like a managerial own goal, locking the USMNT into another four-year cycle of tedious timidity on the field and bizarre machinations off it, the USWNT no longer reign supreme, and MLS commissioner Don Garber’s leadership has a late-imperial stagnation to it after more than two decades in the job. The soccer coverage on Fox Sports, which has mystifyingly been handed the rights to all major international tournaments up to and including the 2026 World Cup, remains incurably embarrassing. But the sport’s general direction of travel in the US is positive. On the field, things are progressing at a reasonable clip, if not totally perfectly. Despite their shock early exit in Australia and New Zealand, the USWNT remain the most successful team in Women’s World Cup history, and while their counterparts in the men’s team have not reached quite the same heights, they are now regular fixtures in the Mundial’s knockout rounds. The USMNT’s performance in Qatar, which included a brawling goalless draw against England and an insipid round of 16 exit to the Dutch, suggested American soccer fans can and should expect more of them. The US has yet to produce a genuine male soccer superstar – following Christian Pulisic’s underwhelming stint at Chelsea, the mantle of expectation has now seemingly passed to Borussia Dortmund’s Gio Reyna – but there’s a bright crop of young players regularly competing for starting spots in Europe’s top leagues. In the women’s game, hope abounds that Sophia Smith, Trinity Rodman and Naomi Girma can extend the world-beating legacy of star veterans like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan in 2027, when the US may well host the Women’s World Cup. Attendances in both MLS (where crowds averaged 22,000 per match last season) and the NWSL (7,000) are buoyant in comparison to other non-European leagues. MLS clubs such as Atlanta, Charlotte and Seattle regularly draw crowds in excess of 30,000, while Angel City and the Portland Thorns boast large attendances in the NWSL, giving the match-day experience some of the texture and volume of European soccer. MLS also had the sixth-highest number of players competing at last year’s men’s World Cup, outranked only by Europe’s big five (the Premier League, La Liga, the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1). Even with oil money upending everything this summer, there’s a fair argument to be made that America boasts the strongest league outside Europe, with perhaps only the Saudi Pro League and the J-League for competition. More than these statistical markers of progress, though, it’s the palpable sense of an emergent and robust soccer culture in America that provides real hope the game will continue to grow and strengthen on these shores. The Latino community remains the heart of the sport’s fanbase in the US, and MLS has arguably embraced Latinos more deeply than any of the country’s other major sporting leagues. Elsewhere the story is more complex. Non-Hispanic America retains some of its insecurity when it comes to soccer, a sense of not quite measuring up to the original – a complex that can be seen in the mimicry of English chants and formulations among American soccer fans (“Dude that nutmeg was proper filthy”) or the prestige that’s still attached to certain accents in TV coverage of the sport on these shores, that enduring Jamesian fondness for the old English plum. (The James in question here is Henry, not Reece.) Nowhere but America would a man like Fox pundit Warren Barton, the former Newcastle full-back whose commentary career consists almost exclusively of the insight that the players on the field need to “put the ball in an area”, be given years on TV to repeatedly, unvaryingly instruct professional footballers to cross the ball. But such is the currency attached to English accents in coverage of American soccer. Beyond the Latino community, supporting soccer in this country can still feel a little forced, like the affectation of a Cockney accent after a week-long vacation in London, and the sport remains a viable, if deflating, punching bag in the local culture wars, an activity that’s still useful code on the right for everything conservatives despise: globalism, foreignness, an openness to the Other. To be an American who supports soccer is still, at some level, an act of cosmopolitan intent, a self-exoticizing declaration of one’s own essential difference from the sports-loving mass of (white) middle America. But that is changing, and fast, because increasingly, watching soccer is simply what America – already a powerhouse of participation in the sport at youth level – does. This is not only a function of robust crowd numbers at MLS matches; it’s also reflected in the growing popularity of soccer on American TV, with NBC’s coverage of the Premier League now reaching approximately 530,000 viewers per match window. (Premier League matches in the UK, by way of comparison, attract an average of more than two million viewers.) The roll call of celebrities who showed up to cheer Messi on from the matchstick grandstands of DRV PNK Stadium in his first two matches for Miami – Kim Kardashian! Serena Williams! Tom Brady! DJ Khaled! – underscores soccer’s rising social status, and every big personality in the NBA now seemingly has his European team of choice: LeBron and Liverpool, Steve Nash and Spurs, Steph Curry and whatever team has just handed him a personalized shirt with his name on the back. Throughout America, men’s soccer is now authentically cool in a way that it wasn’t, say, in the era of Landon Donovan and Brian McBride, when the US was no more than a punchy underdog and the sport was for outsiders, wannabe Europeans and liberal freaks. Local fan culture has grown in sophistication to become the equal of anything in Europe; as anyone who’s spent time in an American-dominated soccer group chat would know, there is no reason for the US to feel any inferiority when it comes to memes and “bantz”, the most critical cultural battleground of the modern game. Soccer in America today – not only as it’s experienced live in stadiums but also as it’s debated and enjoyed in sports bars and WhatsApp threads – has most of the fun of European soccer and none of its baggage. If anything, it’s America that is now influencing the direction of the sport, rather than being influenced by it. The irresistible urge for soccer to “make it” in America is not hard to decode or understand, given the size of the media market here. But as Messi and David Beckham and various outlying figures of the greater footballing firmament – one thinks, for instance, of Troopz, the Arsenal fan blogger who left AFTV in 2020 for the greener, shoutier pastures of New York and Barstool Sports – join the grand transatlantic pilgrimage, it has begun to feel as if America is seen as a nation of spenders first and soccer fans second. Messi’s MLS deal has been designed to include a cut of the subscription revenues from the $2.5bn, decade-long media partnership signed between the league and Apple TV. The structuring of that deal, along with Messi’s committed promotion of the $15/month MLS Season Pass to his 481 million Instagram followers, shows how soccer’s administrators see the sport developing in this country: as a content play with a highly favorable risk/reward profile. No VAR needed here: the commercial upside looks tantalizingly clear. Increasingly, soccer in America is seen primarily as a business, and supporters are treated less as fans with a voice in the sport’s direction than simple consumers, monetizable units to be juiced for all they’re worth. This is true of the sport everywhere, of course, but it’s the specifically American way of monetizing soccer – through a combination of data and performance analytics, private equity and debt financing, and the relentless transformation of soccer into a mediatized, perpetual content product – that is coming to predominate globally. The Saudi approach, by contrast, involves throwing billions of state-supplied dollars at prestige players to enhance Saudi Arabia’s attractiveness as a leisure and recreation destination in a decarbonized future. This is not a strategy that is easily or meaningfully replicable across markets the way the American model of sports investment is. The real story of soccer’s dawning American century is not about lucrative broadcast deals, Messi in Miami, or the coming World Cup. It’s about the influx of American institutional money – mostly supplied by private equity and hedge funds – into the storied clubs of Europe, and the cultural distortions that this export of the American ownership style is triggering. As a very general rule, team fanbases in American pro sports have historically enjoyed less direct participation in the administration of their teams than fans of European soccer have. The structure of a club like Luton Town, freshly promoted to the English Premier League and partly owned by its supporters’ trust, is alien to the world of US professional sports, in which teams are run as pure profit-driven franchises. The American model of ownership makes big structural changes difficult to pull off, inducing a kind of paralysis in the administration of individual sports: MLS’s structuring as a single legal entity, for example, in which club owners effectively operate as franchisees, has long frustrated efforts to introduce promotion and relegation into American professional soccer, since exposing MLS to the full pyramid of professional and semi-professional soccer in this country would effectively be a league-wide act of self-sabotage. More importantly, the American model also incentivizes a culture in which owners feel the need to placate supporters with content and memberships and other bells and baubles of “engagement” that substitute for the lack of real fan participation in the running of their chosen teams. It’s a strategy of distraction designed to keep supporters occupied while owners get on with the real job of maximizing profit – and increasingly it’s the rule in the European game too. Nine of the 20 teams competing in the approaching season of the English Premier League are part- or majority-owned by US investors. American capital’s vulture-like descent on the Premier League has been motivated primarily by a belief in English soccer’s fundamental potential – and undervaluation – as an asset class. The real goal here is not to bring communities closer to the sport they love but to convert them – through gambling, streaming, and various NFT-like imbecilities – into thoughtless consumers of a decontextualized, 24/7 media product. It’s a recipe for engagement without participation, inducing soccer fans into a state of permanent and blissful disenfranchisement. Everything about the direction American investors are taking the sport in (most egregiously, in their dormant dreams for a European Super League) points to a future in which soccer will become fully delocalized, a sport from nowhere. For now the American money men’s attentions are fixed firmly on Europe; but in the future, why not elsewhere? The jolt to the established order of club soccer that the Saudi experiment has administered may raise hopes on these shores that America, eventually, will boast a domestic league to compete with the world’s very best. In recent decades, the fortunes of soccer’s club hegemons have fluctuated according to capital’s ripples: Italy reigned supreme in the 1990s, Spain dominated the 2000s/2010s, England is enjoying its moment today. Nothing about the Premier League’s place as the pinnacle of the modern sport is fixed or preordained. Money will go wherever it sees the biggest opportunity, however that’s measured – including, potentially, to America. But the day when a player like Kylian Mbappé spurns Real Madrid for Real Salt Lake still feels distant, if not impossible; for now, Europe remains the gold standard. Which is why the American investors will keep going to Europe, with their merch and their hashtag campaigns, their EBITDA multiples and their content packages. As the US looks forward to hosting the World Cup and Messi’s prestige enhances the appeal of MLS to the world’s top professionals, a curious dualism has taken hold in American soccer. At a cultural level, soccer in America is still a sport in the process of figuring itself out, a teenager working its way through the ugly bloom of puberty. But as a business proposition, the sport’s potential is already priced in – and the eyes of America’s most ruthless investors are locked on the vast riches that soccer could yet disgorge. Fragility and belligerence make for a curious mix, promising a future that oscillates continuously between potential (a deep run for the USMNT in its home World Cup, a resurgence of the women’s team in 2027) and peril (a 39th Premier League match in New Jersey). The real question is not whether soccer will change America, but how America will change soccer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/aug/30/lucy-letby-inquiry-will-have-power-to-force-witnesses-to-give-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-30T18:40:15Z","webTitle":"Lucy Letby inquiry will have power to force witnesses to give evidence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/aug/30/lucy-letby-inquiry-will-have-power-to-force-witnesses-to-give-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/aug/30/lucy-letby-inquiry-will-have-power-to-force-witnesses-to-give-evidence","fields":{"bodyText":"Witnesses will be forced to give evidence at the inquiry into how Lucy Letby was able to murder seven babies, the health secretary has announced, in a move welcomed by victims’ families. Steve Barclay announced the inquiry would be put on a statutory footing after mounting criticism that it lacked the necessary powers to compel people to give testimony under oath or force the disclosure of documents. Lawyers for the victims’ families argued it was important that former and current staff of the Countess of Chester hospital trust, where Letby worked as a neonatal nurse, could be forced to appear. Letby became only the third woman alive to be handed a whole-life jail term on 21 August when she was sentenced for murdering seven babies and trying to kill another six. Ministers initially insisted that the inquiry should be non-statutory – meaning witnesses could decline to give evidence – so that it could reach its conclusions more quickly. The inquiry is expected to cover the broader context of events at the trust, including the handling of concerns raised by some doctors in the years leading up to her arrest. Governance procedures and the measures undertaken by regulators and the wider NHS will also likely be scrutinised. The announcement came after Rishi Sunak announced that judges would be given more powers to order “cowardly” offenders to attend their sentencing hearings, after Letby refused to appear in the dock to hear victim impact statements from families. Steve Barclay, the health secretary, said he had wanted the nature of the inquiry to be “shaped by the families” and statutory status had been granted after discussions with them. Richard Scorer, head of abuse law and public inquiries at law firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing two of the families, said the move was “essential” not just for the parents of Letby’s victims but “for all of us”. “Without these powers, the inquiry would have been ineffectual and our clients would have been deprived of the answers they need and deserve,” he said. He continued: “We all need to be sure that the NHS delivers the best possible care, that hospital management is accountable and responsive to concerns, and that whistleblowers are treated fairly. We cannot let what occurred at the Countess of Chester hospital to ever happen again. This inquiry must lay bare the facts of what happened but it must also be the start of much needed change.” No judge has yet been appointed for the inquiry and its terms of reference have not been finalised. A statutory inquiry is, under law, one held under the terms of the 2005 Inquiries Act, giving its chair significant extra powers, such as the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence in person, or hand over material – as with the ongoing Covid inquiry’s battle to see material from Boris Johnson that ministers resisted handing over. Under the act, only ministers from either the UK government or devolved nations can establish a statutory inquiry, and it can only be done as a response to a limited set of events, for example the mass loss of life or serious failures in health and safety or regulation. Ministers can also, as in this case, convert another type of inquiry into a statutory one. When this is done they have a duty to make a statement to parliament as soon as possible, setting out who will chair the inquiry and form its panel, and the terms of reference. “The crimes committed by Lucy Letby are truly harrowing, and my thoughts remain with the families of her victims,” said Barclay. “Following her conviction, we announced an inquiry and said the nature of this inquiry would be shaped by the families. Having now discussed this with the families, we will launch a full statutory inquiry giving it the legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. “This statutory public inquiry will aim to give the families the answers they need and ensure lessons are learned.” Dr Ravi Jayaram, one of the doctors who raised concerns about Letby to senior managers at the Countess of Chester hospital, told ITV News: “I don’t understand why, right at the start, there was a rush to say it was going to be non-statutory. “I’m glad this is going to be a public inquiry because no stone will be left unturned and questions that need to be asked will be asked and the answers will be found – unlike in a non-statutory inquiry where questions that will cause difficult or embarrassing answers won’t get asked.” The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, also welcomed the news, saying: “It’s right that the wishes of the families have now been taken into account. “No stone can be left unturned in getting to the truth of this awful tragedy. Nothing short of the full force of the law would do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/20/haunted-by-defeats-keir-starmer-playing-it-safe-but-optimism-missing","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-20T07:32:41Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer’s recipe for power is missing some ingredients – confidence and hope | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/haunted-by-defeats-keir-starmer-playing-it-safe-but-optimism-missing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/haunted-by-defeats-keir-starmer-playing-it-safe-but-optimism-missing","fields":{"bodyText":"‘I wake up every morning imagining the ways in which we could still fuck it up.” So a senior member of Sir Keir Starmer’s team recently confided to me. To understand the brain of Labour’s high command, and to fully appreciate why it so often defaults to a defensive caution, the first step is to grasp how terrified they are of losing an election virtually everyone else assumes the party must win. Four consecutive defeats and 13 years in the wilderness of opposition have left deep psychological scars. Fear of another failure is also entrenched by Labour’s unfortunate history throughout the party’s existence of losing many more times than it has won. It is good for morale to enjoy a double-digit advantage in the opinion polls, but senior Labour people never forget how big leads have evaporated in the run-up to previous elections. Everyone of any significance on Team Starmer is especially haunted by defeats at past elections that Labour had high expectations of winning. They shudder in memory of the fate of Neil Kinnock in 1992. Ed Miliband’s presence in the shadow cabinet is a flesh-and-blood reminder of the bitter disappointment of 2015. In advance of both of those contests, the Tories inflicted a lot of economic misery on Britain. And yet the Conservatives ultimately prevailed at the ballot box because not enough voters were persuaded to trust Labour with the nation’s finances or their own livelihoods. This exposed nerve is throbbing again as a result of last month’s setback in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. If the party could lose a byelection that it expected to win, might that be a foretaste of a much bigger and nastier shock when the general election comes? This is the chilling thought that has shivered down the spines of Labour’s senior ranks. The party’s national policy forum at the end of July heard Sir Keir tell them: “We are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet. We’ve got to face up to that and learn the lessons.” He was referring to the Conservatives’ successful exploitation of hostility towards the expansion of London’s Ulez scheme, but he’s also taken a broader lesson from the Uxbridge defeat. Which is that Labour must do more across the range to fireproof itself from assault by the Tories and their allies in the rightwing media. This has amplified the obsession with reassuring swing voters that they have nothing to fear from a Starmer government while increasing the determination of the Labour leadership to close down opportunities for the Tories to go on the attack. Some call this “getting the barnacles off the boat”, a phrase most commonly associated with the rightwing Australian campaign strategist, Sir Lynton Crosby. Others describe it as a “small target” strategy, so-called because it is designed to suppress any contentions that might work in favour of the Conservatives while making it harder for them to hit Labour. To smother Tory attempts to depict Labour as reckless with the nation’s finances, big-ticket spending items have either been postponed, as is the case with the green prosperity plan, or obliviated, as with the erstwhile commitment to abolish student tuition fees. Labour will not put a date on when it would reverse Tory welfare cuts, including the two-child cap on child benefit that its own frontbenchers have previously denounced as “heinous” and “obscene”. Angst about these compromises and retreats runs through the party all the way up to the shadow cabinet, but not to the extent that it has triggered open revolt. “It’s a very painful place to be,” remarks one member of the shadow cabinet. “But it’s the right place to be because we have to show that we will be fiscally disciplined.” To deny the Tories any opportunity to suggest that Labour would try to reverse Brexit or restore freedom of movement, Sir Keir has ruled out returning to either the single market or the customs union. In the past week, it has been conceded that a Labour government would, at least initially, use Tory-commissioned barges and military camps to accommodate asylum seekers on the grounds that it would have “no choice” because of the “mess we inherit”. Free school meals for all primary schoolchildren in England and universal free childcare from the age of nine months have been further sacrifices to the gods of fiscal responsibility. Faced with Tory claims that they are “anti-business”, there’s been a partial reverse on some of Labour’s commitments to strengthening workers’ rights. This does not mean that Labour is becoming indistinguishable from the Conservatives, the glib charge from the puerile segment of the left. The subtler critique is that a strategy that focuses on safety first actually contains risks. One danger is that Labour is becoming best known not for the policies it promotes, but for the pledges it has ditched and the ambitions it has diluted. Another concern is that Sir Keir is conceding too much territory to the right and by doing so limiting Labour’s scope to deliver substantial change in government. Even some who are highly sympathetic to his relentless emphasis on winning power think Labour needs to display more confidence in both its ideas and its prospects. There’s nothing easier than lamenting that the Labour leader is being excessively cautious. That analysis may even be correct. Yet critics, especially those who bear responsibility for past defeats, should also acknowledge why this is happening. It is 18 years since Labour last won an election. The 2019 defeat presided over by Jeremy Corbyn was Labour’s most calamitous showing at a general election since 1983 (measured by the deficit to the Tories in the share of the vote) and the most catastrophic since 1935 (if your preferred metric is how few Labour MPs were elected). A record of such abysmal failure in the competition for power means it ought not to be a surprise if Sir Keir overcorrects in the pursuit of victory. The caution is not just a result of wanting to armour Labour against unfriendly fire from the Tories. It is also the product of an interpretation of how the electorate is feeling. “We won’t win if we don’t get the mood of the country right,” says someone close to the Labour leader. The prevalent view within Team Starmer is that voters have become too cynical about politicians as a class, too despairing about the dilapidated condition of the country and too sapped of faith that anyone has any answers to be seduced by bold promises to transform Britain. The bogus boosterism of Boris Johnson, the ruinous adventurism of Liz Truss and the severity of the cost of living crisis have seen to that. Voters are highly suspicious of grandiloquent rhetoric and expansive policies with expensive price tags. Sir Keir was almost explicit about this when he shared a platform with Sir Tony Blair at a conference organised by the latter’s Institute for Global Change. The two men agreed that the political climate of today is starkly and grimly different to the atmosphere of upbeat anticipation that prevailed in the run-up to the landslide victory in 1997 won by Sir Tony to the soundtrack of Things Can Only Get Better. “That song resonated because it felt it was the mood of the country at the time. That’s not the mood now by a long shot,” said Sir Keir. “It is a mistake for us to speak to the country as it was in 1997. We’ve got to speak to the country as it is in 2023. The mood of the country is pretty bleak.” The missing ingredient is hope. When it is successful in the pursuit of power, the centre-left usually prevails with recipes that blend realism and optimism. The task is to persuade people that Labour will be responsible in office while also generating some sense of excitement about what a change of government will deliver. That is lacking from how Labour is currently presenting itself because it has not found a way to punch through the miasma of fatalism shrouding Britain. This is not to argue that Sir Keir should suddenly sanction a splurge of fantastical spending promises that the public will not find credible. Nor should he try making messianic speeches that will come over as risible. The challenge for him and his team is to make the thought of a Labour government more enthusing.

Sam Roggeveen, the director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program and a former Australian intelligence analyst, issues the stark warning in an essay published on Monday. “Australia has taken the decision to bring US combat forces, and its military strategy to fight China, on to our shores,” Roggeveen wrote in the latest edition of the Australian Foreign Affairs journal. “We have also chosen to build military capabilities of our own that are designed expressly to contribute to American operations to defeat China. These fateful decisions threaten to draw Australia into a war that is not central to our security interests, and which could end in nuclear catastrophe.” Roggeveen examined the combined effect of decisions, including plans to host up to six US B-52 bombers in the Northern Territory and to rotate US nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling in Western Australia from 2027. He said US bombers operating from Australia could be assigned to strike China’s nuclear infrastructure, including missile silos, command and control facilities, early warning radars and air defence facilities. Roggeveen said it was “hard to overstate the sensitivity involved in threatening another nation’s nuclear forces” and that meant American bombers flying out of the Tindal RAAF base “would be an important target for Chinese forces”. He said the requirement for Australia’s planned nuclear-powered submarines, acquired under the Aukus deal, to carry Tomahawk cruise missiles “can only be interpreted one way: Australia wants the capability to strike targets on Chinese soil”. In the event of war, Roggeveen said, the Australian submarines would probably be assigned to sink Chinese naval ships and submarines, blockade ports or strike targets in China with cruise missiles. If Australia eventually acquired hypersonic weapons under the advanced defence technology pillar of the Aukus deal, Roggeveen said, that could further increase the country’s profile in the eyes of Chinese military planners. He said Australia had previously taken risks “because we have concluded that, on balance, we are likely to be safer within the alliance, with all the obligations it imposes, than outside it”. “But if China’s capabilities to strike Australia are set to increase, and if we are raising China’s incentives to do so, then the judgments we have previously made about whether the risks of the alliance outweigh the security benefits need to be re-evaluated.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Roggeveen said whether the trade-offs were worth it depended on the value Australia placed on American military dominance in Asia, including its ability to defeat China in a war over the future of self-governed Taiwan. He said contrary to its rhetoric, the US had not increased the weight of military power it dedicated to Asia, even as it dispersed its forces to be outside China’s missile ranges, raising questions about its long-term commitment. “In short, six bombers based in Tindal are a less potent military asset than the same number based in Guam, which means America’s deterrent against China is diminishing while the military threat to Australia increases.” Roggeveen is not the first to raise such concerns, although his intervention is notable because of his past experience as a senior strategic analyst at the Office of National Assessments. In the same edition of Australian Foreign Affairs, however, the former senior US official Michael Green argued his country remained “the indispensable power despite itself”. Green, head of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, wrote that in a world without US leadership, Vladimir Putin “would today be ruling Ukraine through proxies in Kyiv” and Taiwan “might have succumbed to Chinese coercion”. “There is no indication that Labor or the Coalition are going to choose neutrality or distancing from America – not with Chinese coercive pressure a new reality and other close partners such as Japan and South Korea choosing to reinforce the American alliance system rather than defect,” Green wrote. The Australian government has repeatedly argued its Aukus plans are intended to contribute to regional peace and stability, and it has also said US bombers have visited Australia since the 1980s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T12:46:58Z","webTitle":"Kremlin denies China’s president urged Putin not to use nuclear arms in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The Kremlin has denied a report that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had personally warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “No, I can’t confirm it,” Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Wednesday when asked about a Financial Times report that said Xi delivered the message when he visited Moscow in March. Peskov said the two countries had issued statements at the time on the content of their talks, calling all other reports about Xi’s state visit to Moscow “fiction”. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Xi has been unwavering in his support for his “dear friend” Putin, while Beijing has helped to prop up Russia’s sanctions-hit economy. China has also repeatedly expressed publicly its opposition to the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In November, Xi told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that the international community should oppose the threat or use of such weapons and “prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia”. Xi reportedly made his nuclear warning to Putin while on his first foreign trip after securing a third term as president, suggesting China was concerned about the possibility that the war in Ukraine would escalate further. Beijing earlier proposed a 12-point peace plan, urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation but critically not suggesting Russia withdraw its forces from Ukraine. Some of Kyiv’s western allies have been sceptical of Beijing’s deterrence credentials given Xi’s “no limits” partnership with Putin. Although the Chinese president has not explicitly endorsed the invasion, he has refused to condemn it and has echoed many of Russia’s justifications for the war, blaming the west for fuelling the conflict by supplying arms to Ukraine. Since ordering his troops into Ukraine, Putin has occasionally issued veiled threats of using nuclear weapons against the country, warning the west last September he was not bluffing when he said Moscow would use “all available means to protect Russia and our people”. Several Kremlin-linked analysts have also advocated for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on Europe. Putin has recently appeared to soften his nuclear rhetoric. Speaking at a conference in St Petersburg last month, he said there was “no need” to use nuclear weapons because the “existence of the Russia state was not threatened”. He added that Moscow had delivered tactical warheads to Belarus, a move described by Nato on Sunday as “dangerous and irresponsible”. According to the Financial Times report, Chinese officials have privately taken credit for convincing Putin to back down from his nuclear blackmail after Xi’s visit to Moscow in March. Kyiv has warned that Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the plant that is occupied by Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/sep/03/australias-visa-system-refugees-immigrants-how-does-it-work","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-03T00:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘Power imbalance’: how Australia’s visa system leaves migrants beholden to their employers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/03/australias-visa-system-refugees-immigrants-how-does-it-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/sep/03/australias-visa-system-refugees-immigrants-how-does-it-work","fields":{"bodyText":"When Ravneet Garcha read out loud the letter in her inbox, the house fell silent. Her parents had 28 days to leave Australia, the administrative appeals tribunal wrote. “My parents just went quiet,” she says. “It was devastating.” Garcha, a 20-year-old nurse, has been living with her mother, Sukhdeep Kaur, and father, Jaswinder Singh, in Sunbury, Melbourne since 2015. The family migrated to Australia from India when Kaur was sponsored by an employer to work as a cook in their restaurant. But Kaur and her husband now have to leave Australia by 5 September or risk being deported, unless the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, uses his discretion to grant them visas. All because her employer failed to nominate her for permanent residency. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “As a mother, I came here for a better future for my children and myself,” Kaur says. “We worked hard, we paid everything to the government.” Her family isn’t alone. Experts say many migrants on employer-sponsor visas seeking permanent residency are beholden to their employers. ‘He had the steering wheel of our lives’ Kaur’s differences with the employer who sponsored her began as soon as she arrived in Australia in 2015 – over when her contract would start, wages, shift patterns and other matters. Kaur’s sponsor was sanctioned by the Australian Border Force in 2018 for breaching obligations around terms and conditions of employment under the migration law related to sponsored visas. The sanction meant Kaur’s sponsorship was cancelled and the employer never lodged Kaur’s nomination for permanent residency. The sponsor told Kaur that he had “a friend who will lodge it instead”, Garcha says. “Our entire life depended on the sponsor,” Garcha says. “He had the steering wheel of our lives. “She couldn’t apply on her own due to the immigration rules for her profession. [She] had to rely on a sponsor.” Kaur’s former employer sponsor did not respond to a request for comment. In May, the administrative appeals tribunal affirmed the Department of Home Affairs’ decision not to give the family permanent residency visas, after a hearing process that lasted four years. The tribunal member Stephen Witts acknowledged “some media material” indicated “there may have been problems regarding the applicant’s sponsor”. Witts considered it was possible the family “allowed themselves to be manipulated” by their employer, but was “not convinced that this evidence is credible”. Garcha says the family provided the tribunal with all the proof they thought could change the decision. “We were hopeful because we thought the hearing felt positive,” she says. “But when we got the refusal … it was devastating, because that was our last resort. “We didn’t know, if it was to get refused, what we should have done and what we could do after that.” This is not how the migration process should be, Garcha says. “Migrants that come here don’t know exactly the country’s rules. We were bound to believe the sponsor.” Employer sponsorship leads to ‘power imbalance’ Sanmati Verma, the managing lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, says Kaur’s case is emblematic of a migration system that leaves workers beholden to their employers. For the past decade, the surest way to secure permanent residency in Australia has been through employer sponsorship. “Employer sponsorship arrangements lead to a power imbalance,” Verma says. Until 2023, it was possible for temporary employer-sponsored visa holders to be employed in an occupation that would not lead to permanent residency, she says. Verma points to the occupation of cook as an example – the profession Kaur was employed in. “You could have spent a decade in Australia but you could never transition to permanent residency,” she says, leaving many migrants “permanently temporary”. From the end of this year, all temporary skilled visa holders, including those with occupations on the short-term list, will have access to permanent residency – so the “group of temporary workers who had been denied even the opportunity to apply for permanent residency will be able to do so”, the minister for home affairs, Clare O’Neil, said in an address to the National Press Club in April. But the dependence on an employer remains the same, Verma says. “You are still sponsored by an employer, you are still beholden to that employer: not only for your visa security, but they have to sign off on your permanent residency application.” The federal government is consulting on whistleblower protections for temporary visa holders, with a new package of legislative powers and funding, a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. This will include making it a criminal offence to coerce someone into breaching their visa condition, introducing prohibition notices to stop employers from further hiring people on temporary visas where they have exploited migrants, increasing penalties and new compliance tools to deter exploitation. Verma has said the move is a “critical opportunity” for the government to “design out some of the levers for exploitation in the migration regime”. But she warns against “window-dressing” reforms, suggesting migrant workers and their allies codesign these protections and urging the end of employer-sponsored visas. “As a start, there must be basic visa protections to allow workers to leave exploitative employers. And in the long run, workers should be able to qualify for permanent residence without being tied to a specific employer.” ‘Look after those people who come here with dreams’ Kaur is now working in a customer service role with Woolworths to pay rent before her and her husband’s time in Australia is up. As they begin packing their belongings, she says “we are all just going through depression”. The family struggle being at home in what feels like a state of limbo, Garcha says. “You keep thinking that you are going to be leaving soon. You have to pack the bags, sell everything … Everything is a big change. “It is devastating to be present. To be waiting for so many years for something good to happen, then realising that this was never part of the plan, is devastating.” Garcha dreamed of being a police officer. When the family was refused permanent residency, she realised she couldn’t apply to an Australian police academy because she wouldn’t be considered a domestic student. “I had to study something to then be able to live here, so my whole life plan changed,” she says. Graduating from a two-year nursing diploma secured her own permanent residency. But Garcha will give it up to remain with her parents. “I couldn’t live here without my parents because I’m here in the first place because of them,” she says. “I studied because of them. “All they wanted is to settle in a new country … They had plans for a better life. Imagine starting from scratch, somewhere else … after working so hard for nearly 10 years.” The family are hoping Giles will intervene. A government spokesperson said the minister’s office was unable to comment on individual cases. They confirmed the department was assessing whether Kaur’s application met the guidelines for ministerial intervention. Guardian Australia understands that Kaur and her husband will remain in Australia lawfully while ministerial intervention is being assessed. If it is not finalised by 5 September, another bridging visa will be issued. “The minister is the only way of right for me and my family to justice,” Kaur says. “We suffered a lot. Now we want justice and a fearless life. It is really a horrible situation. Not just for me. For the other people also suffering and who have no future. Not here, not anywhere.” Kaur urges the government to “look after those people who come here with dreams”. “It is not only me. If a foreign worker comes here … and worked hard, the government should take care of those workers. All of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jul/03/football-sporting-directors-monchi-murtough","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-03T19:00:40Z","webTitle":"From Monchi to Murtough: rising power of football’s executive class ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/03/football-sporting-directors-monchi-murtough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jul/03/football-sporting-directors-monchi-murtough","fields":{"bodyText":"Should there be such a thing as polite football circles, there’s fresh names to drop. Shelve that talk of the Monaco enganche with an xG to die for, or the interesting things that Bayer Leverkusen are doing with inverted full-backs. In this era of LinkedIn, of High Performance, of CEO diaries, of Bazball as a risk-taking design for life, it’s time to celebrate football’s blossoming corporate culture, that of the sporting director, director of football, director of football operations, technical director and other variations besides. All hail soccer’s smartest guys in the room. Not all of these roles are the same; a technical director is likely to oversee coaching at all levels, a director of football might only concentrate on first-team recruitment, while heads of football oversee the entire playing department to report directly to the owners like a finance or sales director might. Amid a footballing summer without a major men’s international tournament, as voracious fans long-read for detail, transfers dominate news agendas. Thus, those executives who operate in the space between dressing room and boardroom have become Very Important Persons. Meanwhile, football’s exec class is on the move; a quasi-transfer market of its own for the game’s chino-clad operatives is currently taking place. You may already know the names. Tim Steidten, freshly in at West Ham, having worked at Werder Bremen and previously presided over interesting things at Leverkusen. Jörg Schmadtke, another experienced Bundesliga hand currently working at Liverpool on a temporary basis, is by old pal Jürgen Klopp’s side until September. Monchi, new president of football operations at Aston Villa, and regarded as the super brain behind Sevilla, a transfer alchemist non pareil. Scott Munn, chief football officer at Tottenham, a former chief executive officer of the City Football Group, of whom Daniel Levy – no less – said: “will take responsibility for the leadership and management of our football activities to instil best practice both on and off the pitch”. Here, then, are modern football’s boys of summer, sending the WhatsApps, detailing lawyers, working out amortisation, hauling wheeled suitcases through airport concourses, slugging down limitless coffees. And like Brad Pitt’s Billy Beane depiction in the film of Michael Lewis’s Moneyball, the urtext of sporting directors across global sport, perhaps not actually watching the games. Formerly backseat drivers have found new prominence. John Murtough, at the club since 2013, football director since 2021, has lately been pushed to the fore by Manchester United, quoted on press releases, lurked in club-issue photos. Meanwhile, when Manchester City released their video of Pep Guardiola handing over the Champions League trophy to Sheikh Mansour in his Abu Dhabi palace, he was joined by Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football, as well as the chief executive, Ferran Soriano, and the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak. City’s structure pairs a genius coach with operatives who have enough self-determination to curb said genius’s wildest instincts, engendering trust to keep him happy by feeding a flow of talent. Even before winning 2023’s treble, City’s front office was already regarded as “best in class”, as incoming Dragon’s Den dragon Gary Neville terms it, the model to follow. Old-style managers who ran clubs from top to bottom have become an extinct breed in the top two divisions of English football. The thought of a manager having to work with an executive in control of transfers and perhaps even the future of the manager himself was anathema. “The most important person at the football club is always the manager,” as Alex Ferguson repeatedly stated, as well he might, but even Ferguson would now have to embrace such modern structures. The days when a manager’s thoughts on players were scribbled on scraps of the Daily Express and his scouting network was trusted pals working on the nod are practices now mothballed. Where Europe has long worked this model, from Carles Rexach working behind Johan Cruyff at Barcelona, to Juni Calafat, hailed as the guru behind Real Madrid’s current success with Brazilians like Vinícius Júnior, Éder Militão and Rodrygo to Bayern Munich in May firing the chief executive Oliver Kahn and the sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic even as an 11th successive title was collected, English football only recently accepted this orthodoxy of structure. The most celebrated sporting director in English football is probably Michael Edwards, who stepped away from Liverpool at the end of the 2021-22 season. Edwards, a bachelor of engineering in informatics from Sheffield University, would not qualify as a classic football man but via data analysis at Portsmouth and Tottenham was appointed sporting director just as Klopp arrived at Anfield. A club previously wracked by indifferent recruitment became transformed. Liverpool, through signings like Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané, could compete with the collective spending Abu Dhabi billions at City. While Klopp took on godlike status, certain shrewdies paid tribute to Edwards’s genius, only for him to depart. That replacement and previous underling Julian Ward quit before the end of the following campaign threw up all types of speculation about the ease of working with Klopp. Just who had been behind misfires like Darwin Núñez and Arthur Melo, the last-gasp loan from Juventus who played just 13 minutes? Since success has many fathers, that Liverpool’s fortunes slid after Edwards’s departure may be coincidence. Despite constant speculation linking him with a return to football he has not yet chosen to exhibit his Midas touch elsewhere. Like managers and players, sporting directors may only fit certain clubs and the sainted – in Seville – Monchi had a less than satisfactory time at Roma from 2017 to 2019, unable to operate within the club’s culture, with Francesco Totti being on his shoulder. Monchi’s usual churn of players failed to produce a winning team before a return to Seville brought two more Europa League trophies. Where might football’s executive class come from? While Edwards came via academia one of the more successful Premier League football directors is Dougie Freedman at Crystal Palace, a popular former player who brought to the club talent like Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze. When Leicester won the 2016 Premier League title, Steve Walsh was the veteran scout credited with unearthing Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kanté and subsequently taken on as Everton’s director of football, only to carry his share of blame for £150m of errant spending. At Sevilla, Monchi was replaced by Victor Orta, well-regarded within insider circles, once hailed for bringing Marcelo Bielsa to Leeds, less so for replacing him with Jesse Marsch. Orta’s fall, sacked in May following barracking by Leeds fans in a defeat at Fulham, presents a parable for the sporting director being almost as perilous a existence as a football manager. Last season, within the Premier League, a trend took hold, that of sporting directors, previously anonymous suits, being targeted. Orta, Fabio Paratici at Tottenham, Laurence Stewart, Chelsea’s co-sporting director alongside Paul Winstanley, Ward at Liverpool, Rasmus Ankersen at Southampton: all were names taken in vain on terraces as well as social media. Even the smartest guys struggle to avoid scapegoating. Transfers have become binary, categorised coldly into success and failure. Where players and managers can physically affect their destiny, those chaps with laptops and contacts books have no such recourse. And should your team start struggling there’s now someone else to be impolite about."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:37:36Z","webTitle":"EDF cuts output at nuclear power plants as French rivers get too warm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","fields":{"bodyText":"The French energy supplier EDF is temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as heatwaves push up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. The majority-state-owned company, Europe’s biggest producer of nuclear energy, said it would extend output cuts at several power stations on the two rivers as the hot spell continues – but that a minimum level of output would be maintained to keep the grid steady. EDF warned of potential output cuts at its nuclear power plants Tricastin, St Alban and Golfech in coming days due to high temperatures in the Rhône and Garonne rivers. It started imposing production restrictions in mid-July at Tricastin, St Alban and Bugey on the Rhône and Blayais at the mouth of the Garonne amid sweltering temperatures. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the company was lowering production “for a few hours” where possible but not shutting the reactors completely. After the 2003 heatwave, France’s nuclear safety authority (ASN) set temperature and river flow limits beyond which power stations must reduce their production, to ensure the water used to cool the plants will not harm wildlife when it is released back into the rivers. Temperatures in southern France are expected to reach 40C over the next two days, according to the forecaster Météo-France. Since 2000, production losses due to high river temperatures and low river flows have represented an average of 0.3% of annual production. However, half of EDF’s 56 nuclear reactors are offline due to planned maintenance and work to repair corrosion which was delayed by the pandemic, just as Europe faces an energy crunch following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the maintenance work, EDF estimates its power output this year will be the lowest in more than three decades. The company issued its fourth profit warning of the year last Thursday when it reported a first-half loss of €5.3bn. The French government, which owns 84% of EDF, is in the process of buying out minority shareholders to take full control of the business. The production cuts mean that France, traditionally an energy exporter, is relying on imports from countries such as Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the UK. EDF is buying electricity at high market prices, after Russia’s war in Ukraine sparked an energy crisis, leaving European countries scrambling to find alternative supplies. Another strain on EDF’s finances comes from a power tariff cap imposed by the government to shield consumers from soaring energy prices. The latest power cuts threaten to push energy prices even higher after they were sent spiralling by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/jul/10/labour-is-right-to-talk-about-the-power-of-oracy","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-10T16:14:25Z","webTitle":"Labour is right to talk about the power of oracy | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/10/labour-is-right-to-talk-about-the-power-of-oracy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/jul/10/labour-is-right-to-talk-about-the-power-of-oracy","fields":{"bodyText":"I was encouraged by reading of Keir Starmer’s ambition to put speaking lessons at the heart of the curriculum (Keir Starmer says he is as ‘laser-focused on poverty’ as Tony Blair was in 1997, 6 July). Despite this causing some to fear that schools would revert to children reciting “How now, brown cow”, oracy or public speaking lessons can build young people’s confidence and career prospects. The charity I lead, Speakers Trust, has visited 600 state schools and worked with 35,000 young people – almost half of whom say they don’t have the confidence, skills or opportunity to share their ideas in public. In our 17 years of commitment to young people, Speakers Trust has experienced first-hand the transformative power of oracy lessons. It’s not just about articulation; it’s about building confidence, sharpening influencing skills, and empowering each student to find and express their unique voice. These are essential skills for young people’s futures. It is a welcome sign that politicians are recognising the importance of oracy as an essential life skill for young people. Working in some of England’s most deprived communities, we understand that developing oracy skills is not just crucial to individual growth, but also a key driver of social mobility. Russell Findlay Chief executive, Speakers Trust • As a deputy headteacher at a primary school in east London, I was heartened to hear Keir Starmer’s announcement. All children, not just those in certain private schools, should be given every opportunity to develop expert spoken communication skills. At our oracy hub in Tower Hamlets, we have been working on this aim for almost five years, with teachers from across the borough collaborating to develop oracy teaching resources and share best practice. The impact has taken us by surprise. We have witnessed not only a dramatic improvement in children’s speaking and listening skills, but also the way that proficiency in oracy complements learning across the curriculum, from problem solving in maths, to expressing opinions about books, to resolving playground conflicts. Nicky Pear Cubitt Town primary school, London • Labour’s plan to give priority to speaking skills might reduce the number of children in conflict with the law (Labour’s plan to improve children’s speaking skills gets mixed reaction, 7 July). About 10 years ago, I remember visiting a prison in Scotland holding teenage boys. Their speaking was almost impossible to understand, not just because their strong accents were exacerbated by their rotten teeth, but because they simply were not used to being listened to and had not developed negotiating skills. We all know that posh, articulate people can negotiate their way out of criminal activity – look at recent governments. An emphasis on speaking will help working‑class children to deal with over‑policing and prejudice. It’s not the answer; but it is helpful. Frances Crook London • John Crace says of Keir Starmer: “Public speaking is still an art that escapes him” (Moving on slowly … Starmer resumes speech after students’ polite protest, 6 July). Surely an unfair comment, given that, earlier in the article, Mr Crace tells us that Starmer dealt seamlessly with protesters who interrupted his speech on live TV. That ability to remain unruffled, to think on his feet and to stay polite, shows skill which is, arguably, as important as great oratory.

The loophole is paragraph 14, and it allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium, the core of a nuclear weapon, from international oversight. On Tuesday, the Chinese mission to the UN accused the US and UK of “clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT”, adding that “such a textbook case of double standard will damage the authority and effectiveness of the international non-proliferation system”. “The nuclear submarine cooperation plan released today by Aukus is a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region,” the mission said. The IAEA said in a statement on Tuesday that Australia, the US and UK had informed it of the deal, but reiterated that the “legal obligations” of the three countries to non-proliferation were “paramount”. “Ultimately, the [IAEA] must ensure that no proliferation risks will emanate from this project,” it said. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, supports the steps taken by Aukus, Kyodo News reported. The government said the nuclear-powered submarine procurement plan was explained to Kishida in a phone call with the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Tuesday. The Aukus partners have held intensive discussions with the IAEA about the plans and taken steps to limit the risk. Early on in the talks, the idea was floated that paragraph 14 might not be invoked at all, and the nuclear fuel would be kept under IAEA safeguards. However, the IAEA was not prepared to have its inspection standards watered down to the extent that the agency would not be able to determine the timing of a visit, and the Aukus partners were squeamish about letting an international team of inspectors onboard their state-of-the-art submarines. To mitigate the proliferation risk, the Australians have agreed not to have a training reactor on their territory, but to train their submariners in the US and UK instead. Australia will not enrich or reprocess the spent nuclear fuel, and the fissile material provided by the US and UK will come in welded units that do not have to be refuelled in their lifetime. Australia has undertaken not to acquire the equipment necessary to chemically reprocess spent fuel that would make it usable in a weapon. “Since day one of this effort, or consultation period, we have prioritised non-proliferation,” a senior US official said. The IAEA director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has said he believes the Aukus partners “are committed to ensuring the highest non-proliferation and safeguards standards are met”, and noted his “satisfaction with the engagement and transparency shown by the three countries thus far”. “I do think the three countries are quite serious about trying to mitigate the harm to the non-proliferation regime. I think they’ve done a very good job engaging with the IAEA,” James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said. “But I still think there is real and concrete harm done. “The primary problem with Aukus was always the precedent set, that Australia would be the first country that would remove nuclear fuel from safeguards for use in naval reactors,” Acton added. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/21/anti-nuclear-groups-welcome-oppenheimer-film-fails-depict-true-horror","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-21T11:06:47Z","webTitle":"Anti-nuclear groups welcome Oppenheimer film but say it fails to depict true horror","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/anti-nuclear-groups-welcome-oppenheimer-film-fails-depict-true-horror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/21/anti-nuclear-groups-welcome-oppenheimer-film-fails-depict-true-horror","fields":{"bodyText":"Strips of translucent, flesh-toned material tear off a woman’s face in one of the closing scenes of Oppenheimer, the new film about the invention of the atomic bomb. She represents its victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, whose skin was burned off in the blast. Yet the reality in Japan was far more gruesome than the artful depiction in the film, which skirts around the human suffering caused by the bomb. Instead, the blockbuster movie from director Christopher Nolan is a pacy look at the scientific quest led by the eponymous J Robert Oppenheimer in the US to build a nuclear weapon faster than the Nazis at the end of the second world war. The film explores Oppenheimer’s moral quandary over his role in creating the most destructive weapon ever made, but nuclear disarmament campaigners fear its power to persuade people of the existential threat posed by nuclear arms may be diminished by its focus on scientific achievement. “The overall impact of the film is unbalanced – people leave the theatre thinking how exciting a process it was, not thinking ‘God, this was a terrible weapon of mass destruction and look what’s happened today’,” said Carol Turner, a co-chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament’s London branch. “The effect of the [Hiroshima and Nagasaki] blasts was to remove the skin in a much more gory and horrible way – in the film it was tastefully, artfully presented. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you look at photographs of actual survivors and read accounts of what happened to them it was a very horrifying, gory death.” She added that although it was historically accurate to portray Oppenheimer’s ethical doubts about his invention, and his subsequent persecution by the US government, in effect this turned him into the film’s hero. Despite these reservations, Turner considers it positive that the film is drawing people’s attention to the “real and present danger” of nuclear weapons arising from the Russia-Ukraine war, especially at a time when there is limited public discussion, for example the comparative silence around the storage of US nuclear weapons in the UK, relative to the outrage of past decades. Diédre Paterno Pai, a manager at Pax Sapiens, an NGO specialising in armed conflict, said: “I don’t know that the general public understands how easy it could be to fall into a nuclear conflict. And the groups working to prevent that from happening are not front and centre in the way that climate change or other existential threats are.” Sebastian Brixey-Williams, the executive director of the Basic thinktank, hoped the film could help reverse the virtual absence of the nuclear debate from the arts over the past three decades, which has engendered a “deep sense of apathy” among the public. “The universe is calling for people to start doing this kind of film. In some ways it’s quite elegant because it’s not looking at some of these issues directly, but asking more reflective questions about nuclear weapons – and that internal struggle Oppenheimer faced really plays out at a societal level. They are difficult trade-offs to make,” he said. “Nuclear weapons are becoming part of the international conversation again and that’s a double-edged sword. I’m glad they are, but this is because nuclear risks are rising,” he added, citing recent US and Russian exits from cold war-era arms control treaties in combination with China’s nuclear arms buildup as reasons for the escalating threats. Brixey-Williams hopes the film will spur members of the public to campaign on nuclear issues, for example by showing their support for multilateral negotiations on deep cuts to nuclear arsenals, or for the rights of Indigenous communities affected by weapons testing and uranium mining. He said: “The human story about Oppenheimer is a useful way into that – it throws down the gauntlet for NGOs like us to give people the tools to respond. [Nuclear weapons] are as out of control as the climate emergency is, but it’s just getting much, much less attention.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T18:50:51Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant reconnected to energy grid as UN warns ‘one day our luck will run out’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN gave an urgent warning regarding Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being disconnected. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday killed at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. A close ally of Alexei Navalny has resigned his post at the opposition leader’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) after it was revealed that he had signed letters calling for the EU to drop sanctions against several UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs. Leonid Volkov confirmed he had signed and sent a 2022 letter to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, in which he called for Brussels to relax sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and business partners German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichev, in a scandal marked by infighting among Russia’s contentious liberal and opposition circles. “This letter was a big political mistake,” wrote Volkov in a post on Thursday where he uploaded the October 2022 letter to Borrell. “Worse, by doing this, I exceeded my authority – I signed it not in my personal capacity, but on behalf of the organisation. I did not inform my colleagues, and, therefore, I also put them [on the letter].” Volkov said he would resign from ACF International’s board and “take a break from my public socio-political activity”. The organisation had earlier published a list of 6,000 “bribetakers and warmongers” it said should be issued with sanctions by western countries. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has expressed concern over the recent power outage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Thursday, power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. During a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of directors held in Vienna, Rafael Grossi criticised the organisation’s complacency in preventing such incidents from happening, noting that its primary role was to ensure nuclear safety. ‘What are we doing to prevent this happening? We are the IAEA, we are meant to care about nuclear safety,’ Grossi told its board of directors in a meeting on Thursday in Vienna. ‘Each time we are rolling a dice,’ he said. You can watch the video here: The German chancellor has said that Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a group of German reporters, Scholz said: “Unfortunately, I see no willingness at the moment,” Scholz was quoted by NBR as saying, adding Ukraine must decide what conditions it is ready to accept for peace. Scholz said that energy supply in Europe’s biggest economy would be sufficient next winter and that the German economy was heading for growth rates last seen in the 1950s and 1960s due to heavy investment in climate protection. Reuters has reported that Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states who are deemed “most hostile” to Moscow. Reuters reports: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - ruled from Moscow during the Cold War but now members of the European Union and NATO - have been among the strongest critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the move was a response to what it called active lobbying by the three Baltic republics for more sanctions against Russia and to their “interference in our internal affairs, inciting Russophobic sentiments”. Last year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began restricting the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus in response to what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. You can read the full report below: “Russia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,” military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius told reporters. “We estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today,” he added. He noted that the assessment depended on the perspective that no foreign country would provide military aid to Moscow. Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to “cause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,” he said. He spoke alongside his counterpart from civilian intelligence at a presentation of their annual report. Beyond estimates of Russian resources, the report also suggested that Russia’s mobilisation last year showed that support for the war in Ukraine “is not as big as the regime’s propaganda tried to make it seem”. “Dissatisfaction with the regime’s policies is currently taking a passive form: mostly avoiding mobilisation, complaining about poor provision and disarray in the army,” the document said. It also raised the possibility that Russia’s failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation and a sudden deterioration of the economic situation “would have negative consequences for the stability of the regime”. Lithuania, a member of both the European Union and NATO, has been a major backer of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February last year. Serhii Andrushko, a Ukrainian reporter, has said that his country’s struggle for freedom also includes another kind of war - against high-level corruption - which experts think could have more success now as Kyiv strives for European Union membership. Reuters reports: Last month, the Radio Liberty correspondent confronted candidates on camera vying to become Kyiv’s next top anti-corruption official about their personal finances and political ties. That might seem less urgent when soldiers are dying every day, but part of Ukraine’s battle includes shedding any perceived similarities to Russia. “Particularly its attitude to corruption,” Andrushko said. According to Transparency International’s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked slightly better than Russia but still well below the global average. So reporters like Andrushko say they are working to keep their rulers honest, a job some experts and media insiders said could have more impact now that Kyiv is under pressure to prove it can clean up its act as it seeks membership in the European Union. They said a major political shake-up seen earlier this year, when more than a dozen officials were dismissed amid a flurry of critical domestic press coverage, could be a taste of things to come if Ukraine’s investigative journalists continue. Their focus also shows civil society is embracing its role as a government watchdog even as the war grinds on. “Media are becoming more influential because they’re appealing to the more acute sense of justice among citizens,” said researcher Petro Burkovskyy, of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank. They will need to choose stories wisely and back up their reporting, he added, since being sloppy or overly critical can invite public scepticism or even accusations of being unpatriotic. Many journalists are also turning their attention to uncovering Russian war crimes and assets in Ukraine. Here is some more detailed reporting on Ukraine’s national grid being reconnected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station today. Reuters reports: Back-up diesel generators - a last line of defence to prevent meltdown from overheating reactor fuel - kicked in after external power was lost to the plant early on Thursday, but they have only enough fuel to power it for 10 days. Ukraine blamed Russia for the loss of power to the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Officials in the part of the Zaporizhzhia region which is occupied by Russia called it a “provocation” by Kyiv. The incident renewed fears of an accident at Europe’s largest atomic power station, nearly four decades after the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but national grid operator Ukrenergo signalled that repairs had been carried out quickly. “Specialists of ‘Ukrenergo’ have restored the power supply of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant), which was interrupted by today’s missile strikes,” it said in a statement. “The ZNPP is switching from diesel generators to receiving electricity for its own needs from the unified energy system of Ukraine.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of compromising safety by shelling the site of the plant, forcing power cuts during air strikes and flouting safety measures. Russia has denied shelling the site, and has accused Ukraine of being behind the shelling. “The risks of disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP are significantly increasing, and our ability to react to them, to avoid them are significantly decreasing,” Oleh Korikov, acting chairman of the Ukrainian state nuclear safety watchdog, told a news briefing on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, also expressed alarm after confirming the back-up generators had kicked in. Calling for a protection zone around the plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the watchdog’s Board of Governors: “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out.” IAEA monitors are currently on site and Grossi has been pressing both sides to establish a demilitarised “safe zone” around the station. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. In the past year, the comedian turned politician has appeared via satellite during the Grammy awards and Golden Globes and within film festivals such as Cannes and most recently Berlin. Last month marked the one year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine. Zelenskiy had secured Mike Simpson, a top power agent at major agency WME, after his client Aaron Kaufman co-directed Ukraine documentary Superpower made with Sean Penn, who loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskiy last year. The actor called it “a symbolic silly thing” but after Ukraine wins the war against Russia, he could bring it back to him. He had previously promised to smelt an Oscar if the Academy didn’t let him speak. “There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelensky] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” he said. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. EU countries plan to pool demand and sign their first joint gas contracts in the coming months, to help fill storage caverns ahead of peak winter demand as Europe replaces Russian gas. “Ukraine has indicated that on top of their own domestic production, they might need, for a secure winter, another 2 billion cubic metres,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told a news conference on Thursday. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who leads the EU’s joint gas-buying, held a video call with international gas suppliers on Wednesday. Sefcovic said Europe was on track to expand its capacity to regasify liquefied natural gas to 227 billion cubic metres by 2024, up from 178 bcm now, as countries swap Russian gas for other supplies. Participating in the EU scheme could help Ukraine to stave off gas shortages. Of the 27.3 bcm of gas Ukraine used in 2021, domestic production accounted for about 19.8 bcm, imports were 2.6 bcm and 4.9 bcm of gas was taken from underground storage. Initial estimates from state-owned energy firm Naftogaz suggest Ukrainian gas production was around 18 bcm in 2022. Ukraine uses little gas to produce electricity, but relies on the fuel for heating and industry - sectors vulnerable should Russian strikes damage infrastructure. Ukraine does not import gas directly from Russia, but Ukrainian pipelines still carry some Russian gas to Europe. Russia has bombarded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent months, and on Thursday launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Kadri Simson said she would convene an emergency video call with Ukraine and EU energy ministers on Thursday to discuss the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, after Kyiv said Russian attacks had severed the plant from the power grid and forced it onto emergency diesel power. Russian strikes hit targets across a sleeping Ukraine early on Thursday. The capital, Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, were some of the places struck by a barrage of missiles, knocking out power to several areas. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv and the strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the European Union is completely ignoring any talks on the need to carry out an investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts, Reuters reports. Russia has repeatedly asked to be allowed to join the investigations into the blasts, which ruptured three of the four pipelines of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas links that connect Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Earlier today the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described it as “incomprehensible” that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the south command of the Ukrainian armed forces has claimed to have destroyed a Russian self-propelled artillery installation on the Kinburn spit. The claim has not been independently verified. The Kinburn spit is a stretch of land that stretches out from Kherson oblast to the west, and is opposite the southern coast of Ukraine that runs from Odesa to Mykolaiv. It is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed. Petr Pavel, a former Czech army chief and high-level Nato official, took the oath of office to start his five-year term as Czech president on Thursday. Pavel beat populist former prime minister Andrej Babiš in a January election on pledges to firmly anchor the central European country in the European Union and Nato, a turn away from the policy of predecessor Miloš Zeman, who had tried to boost relations with Russia and China. Pavel, a social liberal who campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, has tried to convey a message of unity after the divisive Zeman, who retired after 10 years in office on Wednesday. Reuters reports Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties, but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has fully supported continued aid for Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s invasion. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine was reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid on Thursday, Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Energoatom had said earlier on Thursday that power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said she believed that Russia’s latest assault on the country was an attempt to make citizens feel as though the country was “not safe” to continue living in. Sovsun added that she thought the primary purpose of the attacks was to “make sure everybody feels scared” after a period of relative safety in the country’s capital, Kyiv. Reuters reports that local security services in the Moscow-backed breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova said on they had thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt against the region’s leader, according to Russian state news agencies reported. Reuters reports: Kyiv rejected the claims as a Kremlin “provocation”, the latest in a series of allegations, claims and counterclaims over escalating tensions in the territory, wedged along Ukraine’s south-western border with Moldova. It was not immediately clear whether the Transnistrian officials had provided evidence to support their claim. “The ministry of state security informs about the prevention of a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine, a crime was being prepared against a number of officials. The suspects have been detained,” the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted the ministry as saying. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that the accusation “should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin”. It added: “Lies and provocations are the weapons (Russia) actively uses. But today the entire world sees the true face of the aggressor country and does not believe the statements of Russia or its satellites.” Transnistria, a mainly Russian-speaking territory which borders Ukraine, broke from Moldova’s control in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is dependent on Russian support. Its allegiance to Moscow and location on Ukraine’s western border have been a constant cause of concern since Russia invaded that the war could spread to the region. Last month, Russia accused Ukraine of planning to invade Transnistria after staging a ‘false flag’ operation there, a claim Kyiv denied. Moldova also rejected Russia’s claim. Moscow also said it would view as an attack on itself any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers stationed in Transnistria. In a statement this morning about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time – let me say it again sixth time, that ZNPP has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Let me remind you - this is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.” He added: “What are we doing? How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on. I am astonished by the complacency. What are we doing to prevent this from happening? Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out”. You can read an explainer regarding the significance of the power plant here: The South Korean company Hyundai Motor Co is in talks with a Kazakhstan company over the sale of its manufacturing plant in Russia, it has been reported. Reuters reports: Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of hi-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of western manufacturers since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. The local government in St Petersburg has been negotiating with Kazakhstan to sell Hyundai’s Russia plant, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a Tass report. Yonhap reported that negotiations to sell Hyundai’s plant in St Petersburg to an auto-related company in Astana, Kazakhstan, are in the final stage, citing an unnamed source. The deal could be signed as early as June, it said. Hyundai suspended operations at its Russian factory last March. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Intense fighting has continued in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The below graphic shows the Russian military advances within the region. A residential building in Lviv oblast has been targeted by Russian missiles. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of the Lviv oblast administration, released drone footage showing the aftermath of the attack on Thursday. A fifth person had died in overnight strikes, the governor said. Reuters has reported more details on the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday, killing at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Reuters reports: The first big volley of missile strikes since mid-February shattered the longest period of comparative calm since Moscow began a campaign to attack Ukraine’s civil infrastructure five months ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile that destroyed a village house in the western Lviv region, according to emergency services. Drone footage from the area, some 700 km (440 miles) from any military battlefield, showed a flattened home surrounded by badly damaged buildings. Another civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson. In the capital Kyiv, residents were awakened by explosions. A seven-hour air strike alert through the night was the longest of the Russian air campaign that began in October. “I heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,” said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms. “It’s very frightening. Very frightening. The child got scared and jumped out of bed,” she said. “How can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans, I don’t know what to call them. They are frightening the children, their mental state will be disrupted.” Moscow says its campaign of targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure far from the front is intended to reduce its ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which President Vladimir Putin regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which NATO has no answer. Ukraine said the missiles had knocked out the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, severing it from the Ukrainian grid. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster there caused by fighting. Moscow said the was being kept safe on diesel backup power. “Everything is absolutely normal: the specialists at the plant are working quite professionally, the automation has started up,” Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of Russian state energy firm Rosenergoatom, said on state TV channel Rossiya 24. “There is no threat or danger of a nuclear incident. There is more than enough fuel and, if necessary, it will be supplied to the plant.” Alessio Mamo has been at the scene of today’s strike on Kyiv for the Guardian. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. In a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, UN secretary general António Guterres told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tobi Thomas will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Another series of air raid sirens have just sounded across Ukraine, including in Odesa and Kherson in the south, Lviv in the west and Sumy in the north. The air raid alert in Kyiv overnight lasted for seven hours, as a total of 81 missiles were fired at targets across the country by Russia. Reuters reports that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia and other countries had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine.

He added it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. German prosecutors confirmed yesterday that investigators had searched a boat that may have been used in the bombings. Earlier today our First Edition newsletter carried some analysis of the situation, with Archie Bland speaking to our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh. Here is what they had to say about the range of people who might be considered responsible for the attack: While the consequences for European energy supplies have not ultimately proven severe, there are wider implications, Sabbagh said. “Technically this is an attack in international waters, but it’s within the Nato sphere. It’s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.” If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine. If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US – particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany. And evidence of Moscow’s culpability “would be a new frontier in Russian aggression,” Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies “would further unite the west against Putin”. You can read more of that analysis here: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage – and who may be responsible Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. “We have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,” Reuters reports the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told a meeting of EU lawmakers. EU countries plan to sign their first contracts to jointly buy gas by this summer. The Kremlin said on Thursday that there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the Black Sea grain deal, and that there were currently no plans for a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The deal, which allows grain to be safely exported from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade, expires on 18 March, but cannot be extended if Russia objects. Moscow has already signalled it is unhappy with aspects of the deal, as it seeks to expand the markets for its own agricultural products. Ukraine has said it will seek to extend the deal for at least a year, and wishes the port of Mykolaiv to be included. Kyiv said Russian shelling killed three people on Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, as Moscow unleashed a wave of missile strikes overnight. “Russian terrorists shelled Kherson in the morning. They hit … a public transport stop. Three people died as a result of the shelling,” AFP reports Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. In its report Tass writes: Assassination attempts on a number of officials of Transnistria were prepared on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service (SBU), the ministry of state security of the republic reported. Suspects of preparing an assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria were detained and are giving confessions. The impending assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria is qualified as a preparation for a terrorist attack. The prosecutor of Transnistria said that the SBU was preparing a terrorist attack using a car bomb in the center of Tiraspol. The claims have not been independently verified. Transnistria, which attempted to break away from Moldova in the early 1990s, borders Ukraine’s west and has Russian troops stationed there. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. “I think it is time to make a decision,” Reuters reports Nad said on Facebook. “People are dying in Ukraine, we can really help them, there is no room for Slovak politicking.” The governor of Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, has given further details of the strike that has killed five people. In a message on Telegram he posted to say: Today, around 4 o’clock in the morning, an enemy missile fell in the Zolochiv district during an air raid. Three men and two women who were at home at that moment died. The fire destroyed three residential buildings, three cars, a garage and several outbuildings. The fire was extinguished. The demolition of the destroyed buildings has already been completed. 28 rescuers, five units of special equipment and a canine team were involved in the work. Drone footage shows the aftermath of the strike. The regional governor said air defences shot down missiles over Lviv, but “I cannot say exactly how many missiles were destroyed over our region, the relevant services have asked not to make this information public” and he urged the public not to release details. Kozytskyi went on to say: As usual, during the day, internally displaced people arrived in our region by evacuation trains, and people also left by train to Przemyśl [in Poland]. In the districts of Lviv oblast, humanitarian aid was collected and handed over to soldiers on the frontlines and to residents of frontline settlements, cars were sent to the defenders. Our foreign partners transferred aid to the communities of the region. Everyone lived yesterday, doing good deeds and getting closer to victory in their place. But we woke up to sirens, and news about the dead. We will never forget this day. We will never forgive. And we will direct all our efforts to revenge and the return of justice. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes on Ukraine as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. In a tweet he said: Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, leading to loss of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. No military objective, just Russian barbarism. The day will come when Putin and his associates are held accountable by a special tribunal. Reuters reports that Nato member Denmark has confirmed that Troels Lund Poulsen will continue to act as acting defence minister in the absence of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Ellemann-Jensen, 49, was briefly admitted to hospital in February after making a trip to Ukraine and has been on an indefinite period of sick leave. At the time he said in a Facebook message: “I have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending me a signal that it’s time to take a break, if not it’s going to end badly.” Here are some more of the images to come out of Kyiv today. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his official Telegram about the night’s events, writing: It’s been a difficult night. A massive rocket attack across the country. Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia regions. Attacks on critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families. All services are working. The energy system is being restored. Restrictions were imposed in all regions. The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done. We thank the guardians of our skies and everyone who helps to overcome the consequences of the occupiers’ sneaking attacks. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has posted this summary to Telegram of the latest news to emerge from the overnight strikes. It reports: In Kyiv, the alarm lasted for about seven hours. Two people were hospitalised due to falling rocket fragments. Five people were killed in the Zolochiv district of the Lviv region due to a rocket hitting a residential area, one person was killed and two were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Energy infrastructure and industrial enterprises were also damaged in the region. About 15 strikes were made in Kharkiv and the region, two people were injured. Critical infrastructure was targeted. Metro and electric transport are not working. In Kirovohrad oblast, Odesa oblast and Zhytomyr oblast, energy infrastructure facilities were hit. Also, according to preliminary information, there are hits in Vinnytsia. At night, electricity restrictions were applied preventively in all regions to reduce risks to the system. Emergency power outages were used in regions where infrastructure was damaged. Kharkiv region and Zhytomyr region are partially de-energized. Kharkiv is completely without electricity. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some more images from the scene of the strike in Kyiv. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has announced that a fifth person has been killed in overnight strikes. He posted to Telegram to say: The number of people killed as a result of the fall of the rocket in the Zolochiv district has increased to five. The body of another man, born in 1963, was discovered under the rubble. Sincere condolences to the relatives. Ukraine’s air force has issued a statement via Telegram on the wave of attacks from Russia overnight. In it, it claims that “the defence forces of Ukraine destroyed 34 cruise missiles … as well as 4 ‘Shahed-136/131’ unmanned aerial vehicles”. It claims that a total of 48 Kalibr-type cruise missiles had been fired by Russia. It described the attack as featuring “81 missiles of various types” in total, and that “the launches were carried out from 10 Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighters, six MiG-31K aircraft and three Kalibr KR carriers in the Black Sea”. It adds: “As a result of organised countermeasures, 8 Kh-31P and Kh-59 guided air missiles did not reach their targets. It is worth noting that the armed forces of Ukraine do not have means capable of destroying Kh-22 and Kh-47 ‘Kinzhal’ and S-300.” The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that energy company DTEK has reinstated power in Dnipropetrovsk. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has provided this update via Telegram on the situation overnight in his region. He wrote: The enemy launched a massive rocket attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. At least 15 arrivals of S-300 missiles were recorded. Critical infrastructure objects are hit. In addition, a civil infrastructure object was damaged in the city of Kharkiv. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn, with one of them hospitalised, and that an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. He added that during the previous day, multiple settlements had been shelled with the result that “houses and commercial buildings were damaged, fires broke out”. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires of the aftermath of strikes on Kyiv overnight. That’s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’ll be handing over to my colleague Martin Belam shortly. Here is what happened overnight, as Russia launched mass strikes across a sleeping Ukraine: Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he won’t meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “Residents of Lviv oblast, an air alert lasted for four hours this night … In Zolochiv district, an enemy rocket fell in a residential area. A fire started. It has already been extinguished,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them.” Three residential buildings were destroyed. Kozytskyi posted a video of the damage: More now on Zaporizhzhia. The statement from state energy company Energoatom says: On the night of 9 March, the enemy delivered another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. “As a result of shelling, the last line that fed the ZNPP was damaged. Now the station works on diesel generators. The Russians are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. And this is the day after the negotiations with the UN on the demilitarization of the ZNPP,” said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Also, as of 6,30am on 9 March, shelling of energy facilities was recorded in the Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr regions. Here is our wrap of the attacks overnight: Volleys of Russian missiles struck targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second city of Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also hit, but no casualties were immediately reported. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitschko has just confirmed that one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents are now without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. It is currently 8am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of what has happened overnight: Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were registered in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. Power supply has been cut pre-emptively to about 15% of Kyiv residents, he said. The strikes cut Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant off from the power grid, the company Energoatom announced on Thursday morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s National Grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Zelenskiy said he won’t meet with Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is a photo from Svyatoshyn in Kyiv, where missile strikes set cars alight: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been off from the Ukrainian power grid, the power company Energoatom announced this morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Missile strikes in Zhytomyr have left people in the city without water, according to the mayor. Air sirens are sounding in Mykolaiv, the governor, Vitalii Kim, has just said on Telegram. Electricity supply has been cut for 15% of people in Kyiv, the mayor, Vitalii Klychko, said. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klychko has confirmed that there has been another explosion in the city, this time in Svyatoshyn district. He said that there were two people injured. “Another explosion in the capital. Svyatoshyn district. All services go to the place. Cars are burning in the yard of one of the residential buildings. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters! Two injured in Sviatoshyn district. Medics provide assistance on the spot.” The CEO of Ukrainian power company Yasno, Serhii Kovalenko, has said that emergency power cuts have been put in place due to the mass strikes. “Morning. Emergency blackouts are used due to the enemy attack. This is a preventive step, as you all remember,” he said. It is currently 7.20 am in Kyiv. The Kyiv Independent reports that, according to one of its journalists, another loud explosion was heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago. “This is nowhere near over,” The British Ambassador to Ukraine has just said on Twitter. Maxim Tucker of the Times has posted a video of what he says is smoke rising from Kyiv thermo-electric power station this morning: New Voice of Ukraine journalist Euan MacDonald said that the Kyiv explosion was “near Troyeshyna on left bank of Dnipro (there’s a heat-power plant nearby). Must have been a big bang if I heard it 10km?” Kyiv’s mayor has reported that Russia has struck Kyiv during its latest mass strikes accoss Ukraine. “Explosions in the Holosiiv district of the capital. All services follow in place. More details later,” Kyiv’s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram a few minutes ago. Reporters in Kyiv said they heard a loud explosion at around 6am. The explosions are part of a pre-dawn wave of mass strikes by Russia launched before dawn on Thursday. Maxim Tucker of the Times posted a video of what he said was smoke rising from a thermo-electric power station in Kyiv: Explosions were also reported in Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. Air raid sirens sounded across the country. Ukrainian newspaper Dzerkalo Tyzhnia is also reporting an explosion in Kyiv, as well as blasts heard in the city of Sumy, and a drone spotted above the western Lviv region. The Kyiv Post is reporting that one of its journalists has heard explosions in the city amid air raid warnings. The Guardian has not verified this independently. Asked by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer whether the US will send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets Zelensky said, “The fighter jets issue is difficult. We’re waiting for this decision to be taken.” “We really need this and really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots, and President Biden told me that it will be worked upon … I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend our skies,” Zelensky said. Zelenskiy invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in the interview with CNN. When told of the invitation McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. Zelenskiy said that his children are still in Ukraine. “My daughter joined the university and she studies there, and my son is attending school in Ukraine,” he said in his CNN interview. “They’re both in Ukraine. They’re very much like other Ukrainian kids. We live with sirens.” “We want victory. We don’t want to get used to war, but we got used to the challenges. Everyone wants one thing: to end the war,” he said. Zelenskiy appeared on CNN this evening in the US, in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word”. “We don’t have any confidence in him,” Zelensky added. “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is more detail on what local officials have said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. “As a result of a mass missile strike, an energy infrastructure site was hit in the region as well as residences,” Marchenko said on Telegram. He said anti-aircraft units had downed some missiles and new attacks could follow. “Fortunately, there are no casualties. Electricity restrictions are in effect.” Kharkiv region Governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by about 15 strikes. “The enemy made about 15 strikes on the city and region,” he said on Telegram. “Infrastructure was again among the targets. Information on casualties is being clarified.” Another strike was reported in the central city of Dnipro and in the western towns of Lutsk and Rivne, far from the front lines in the year-old war. Air raid sirens are sounding across the country before dawn this morning. BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa wrote on Twitter, “It’s 3 am in Ukraine. Russia won’t let Ukrainians sleep tight tonight. Lots of drones and rockets fired in all possible directions in Ukraine … This is the terror civilians’ve been living through for more than a year already.” Analysts and Ukrainian leaders had expected mass missile strikes during the week of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 24 February. The Kyiv Independent reports that explosions have been heard in several cities and regional communities, but we are waiting for confirmation from local officials. The newspaper listed the cities and regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk among those where explosions were heard. Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, Reuters reported, citing regional officials. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Residential areas had also been hit, but no casualties were reported. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. It’s 5am local time in Kyiv, and we have reports of strikes across Ukraine, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. We’ll have more news shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war: The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said. The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN. Zelensky has also called for “democratic success” in Georgia where thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day, against a controversial “foreign agent” bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said in his evening address to the nation. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m, the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish. German officials announced that they searched a ship in January that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation. Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-17T22:37:48Z","webTitle":"Manchester City’s inexorable hard power crushes Real Madrid | Jonathan Liew","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/17/manchester-citys-inexorable-hard-power-crushes-real-madrid","fields":{"bodyText":"It was at around 70 minutes, shortly after Toni Kroos had followed Luka Modric off the pitch, that the edges of the night began to sharpen a little and this Champions League semi-final took on a perfect clarity. Manchester City were going to win and Real Madrid were going to lose and no tweak or tactic, no switch or substitution, was going to change that fact. Real seemed to realise it too. Perhaps they were only 2-0 down but they were also bruised and broken, scarred and scared, tired of running into dead ends filled with blue shirts. Vinícius Junior had long since stopped trying to beat Kyle Walker and had instead resorted to dribbling past as many players as possible, like kids do in the playground. The fouls became more deliberate and more desperate. Even the Spanish radio commentators at the back of the press box had given up shouting and exhorting in favour of low, funereal voices and the odd illegible hand gesture. On the biggest stage, in their favourite competition, the most dominant club in Champions League history had been placed under intolerable levels of stress, and simply detonated. It finished four-nil, and perhaps that flattered Madrid a little. Ultimately only the flailing fingertips of Thibaut Courtois prevented this from becoming a total humiliation, the sort of scoreline that eventually earns a game its own Wikipedia page. It was probably City’s greatest performance under Pep Guardiola, a kind of footballing perfection, a museum piece, not merely a lesson but a scolding, sport as scorched earth strategy. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. What does remain? Certainly very little of this great Madrid side. Everyone knew this was a team in need of a transitional phase, a shift from the old to the new. Nobody expected it to happen in a single night. Modric – horrible performance – went off on 63 minutes. Kroos – not much better – departed a little later. Karim Benzema looked old. Will any of them ever play a game of this magnitude again? Maybe, but not together. At the point when Madrid most needed mobility and energy, they were left trying to press and disrupt the world’s best passing side with myth and aura alone. For once the numbers told much of the story. At the time City scored their first goal they had completed 196 passes to Madrid’s 30. It took 14 minutes for Rodrygo to have his first touch of the game. During the first half City had 196 touches in the final third; Madrid had 10. This wasn’t just dominance. There was a sadistic scorn to it too, the way City took their set-pieces as quickly as possible, the way Pep Guardiola threw a strop at every backward pass. City didn’t just beat Madrid, they barely acknowledged them. With the greatest of respect to Matteo Darmian and Edin Dzeko, it feels safe to assume that City will finally slake their Champions League thirst against Internazionale in Istanbul next month. They are so clearly the best team in the world at this point that it already feels a little passé, a little obvious, to say so. Nor should we imagine that City have only just started playing at this level. The last team to beat them over 180 minutes in this competition was Tottenham. On a long enough x-axis, City were always going to cross the winning post at some point. And so one of the world’s richest states spends years trying to hire the world’s greatest coach, succeeds, and then gives him literally everything he needs. Every other club in the world, with the exception of Paris Saint-Germain, has to operate within the constraints of finance or fortune. Every other club in the world has flaws or problem areas that they can’t address right now, but hope to at some point in the future. Guardiola, by contrast, gets the staff he wants, the players he wants when he wants them, gets their replacements ahead of schedule. So you don’t just sign Erling Haaland, you sign Julián Álvarez to give him a rest. Kalvin Phillips arrives for £45m, doesn’t play all season, and it’s fine. You decide – and just reflect on the breathtaking audacity of this for a second – that you need an upgrade on Phil Foden, and so up pops Jack Grealish. If someone accuses you of breaking the rules, you hire the world’s greatest lawyers to shoot them down. This is perfection, but not so much the perfection of great art as the perfection of a finely-executed military campaign, the perfection of unlimited wealth, the perfection of political strength, the perfection of a pointless mile-high crystal pyramid in the middle of the desert. No academy players and no Mancunians started for City last night. Does this matter? Does anything matter? Nobody should begrudge City fans their joy at this point. This has been their journey and their success as much as anyone else’s, and with a little perspective they may even realise that they are not as hated as they sometimes assume. Rather, the overwhelming sensation here for the neutral is indifference, a shrug at the inexorable inevitability of hard power.

After some atmospheric shapes thrown by her supporting dancers, men and women wearing suits, tilting microphones under conical spotlights, the star herself steps through a beaded curtain and into the limelight. In a slinky, spotty dress she crosses her wrists high above her head and then begins to dance. She is imperious as she moves, her feet beating out rhythms with heel, ball and toe, so quick they seem impossible, arms in sinuous curves that whip across her body, turning her on her axis. She has extraordinary control of every fierce movement as the geometric shapes of the light in which she stands are cut into softer, more human curves by the sway of her body, the bend of her back. At one moment she is making thunderous sounds; at the next, her footwork fades into absolute soft silence. At 52, and with a wealth of experience behind her, Baras has the audience in the palm of her outstretched hand, playing with their knowledge and their expectations, smiling with pleasure at her ability to entertain and dazzle. It’s a breathtaking display that gets the annual Flamenco festival at Sadler’s Wells off to a world-class start. Alma means soul, and it combines bolero and flamenco in tribute to Baras’s father, Cayetano Pereira, who died in January. The forms combine to create a two-hour show of contrasts, of music beautifully played and sung, of dances switching between group efforts for five women and one man and individual displays of technique. As music director, composer and guitarist, Keko Balodomero provides a score of varied moods, from melancholy to vibrant, played by an exceptional five-piece band. But although everyone plays a strong part, it is Baras who electrifies the show. She dances solo and with different partners – a man (Daniel Saltares), a saxophone player (Diego Villegas) – mirroring her moves to theirs in intricate patterns. In her hands, even a shawl becomes a speaking thing as she hurls it in the air so it wraps her like an eagle’s wings, or pulls it around her like a second dress, straightening her body to its full height. The power and fluency of her movement is mesmeric. The warmth of her personality is infectious. She utterly owns the stage. At the close, after several encores and much laughter, Baras was presented with the Olivier award for outstanding achievement in dance, which she won in 2020 but couldn’t collect because of Covid. It was a triumphant ending to a memorable evening. The Flamenco festival runs at Sadler’s Wells, London, until 15 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jul/29/us-congress-age-lawmakers-millionaire-boomer","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-29T13:00:39Z","webTitle":"US Congress is a cozy club of ageing multimillionaires hoarding power | Arwa Mahdawi","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/us-congress-age-lawmakers-millionaire-boomer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/29/us-congress-age-lawmakers-millionaire-boomer","fields":{"bodyText":"Enough with America’s gerontocracy “When hell freezes over, there will be three things left: Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell and cockroaches,” the Republican senator John Kennedy recently told NBC News. While that sounds like a pretty terrible deal for the cockroaches, Kennedy isn’t wrong in his assessment. Grassley, the 89-year-old Republican senator from Iowa and McConnell, the 81-year-old Republican leader in the US Senate, are remarkably tenacious. They got jobs in government decades ago and they’ve clung to power ever since. Still, while the two men may like to think otherwise, they are both mere mortals. The world got a rather dramatic reminder of this on Wednesday when McConnell appeared to suffer a medical incident during a news conference on Capitol Hill. The Kentucky Republican stopped speaking mid-sentence and, for 23 very awkward seconds, stared silently into the distance. Eventually one of his aides led him away. What happened? Did his decades of underhanded political scheming suddenly flash before his eyes? Did the man who jokes about his opponents comparing him to Darth Vader suddenly realize he’d spent his entire life working to make the US a more miserable, less equitable, place? Or did he have some sort of seizure? It’s not entirely clear. McConnell’s own explanation of events was to jokingly say he’d been “sandbagged”. This was a reference to Joe Biden tripping and falling over a sandbag at an air force graduation last month. McConnell’s first instinct, having a suffered a moment of vulnerability, was to get a dig at Biden in. Charming, charming man! Still, his deflection hasn’t stopped questions being raised about his physical and mental fitness – particularly as this latest episode comes after reports the lawmaker has fallen multiple times this year. McConnell wasn’t the only high-profile politician to suffer some mental confusion this week. Ninety-year-old Dianne Feinstein seemed muddled during a vote on a defense appropriations bill on Thursday. Instead of just responding with “aye” or “nay”, as expected, she began to deliver a speech. About 15 seconds in, an aide whispered to her “Just say aye.” Feinstein obliged. This moment of confusion might not have been a big deal had it not been for the fact that there have been a lot of questions asked recently about the senator’s cognitive and physical health. Feinstein was absent from Washington for several months this year because of shingles, holding up important efforts to advance federal judges for confirmation. There have been numerous reports about her forgetfulness and confusion: at one point she even seemed to forget that she’d been absent from the Senate. McConnell and Feinstein’s back-to-back cognitive incidents should serve as a wake-up call: the advanced age of America’s top politicians isn’t normal and it isn’t healthy. Biden, of course, is already the oldest president ever; if he wins in 2024, he would be 86 by the end of a second term. Biden is prone to weird gaffes (like the time he ended a speech on gun control with the words “God save the Queen, man”) and falls. Will he really be fit to lead at 86? Meanwhile, the median age of the Senate is 65.3, according to FiveThirtyEight’s calculations, the oldest ever. That’s over two decades older than a median age of 38.8 in the US as a whole. To be clear: it’s not age in itself that’s the issue here. I have no doubt that some of the octogenarians in government (81-year-old Bernie Sanders, for example) have way more energy than I do. The issue here is the sheer number of octogenarians who have been in government for decades. The ridiculous number of career politicians who seem to have no intention of ever leaving office unless they’re carried out in a coffin. I’m not sure if there should be age limits in government but there should certainly be term limits. A healthy democracy requires a constant stream of fresh blood and fresh ideas. It requires mechanisms that stop people becoming complacent in their ivory towers. What we have now, however, is a cozy club of ageing multimillionaire lawmakers who have been hoarding power and who refuse to make any space for a younger generation. There’s a word for this sort of oligarchical rule by elderly lawmakers, of course: gerontocracy. Funnily enough Google searches for the term shot up this week. Do AI girlfriend apps create unhealthy expectations for human relationships? Perhaps we needn’t worry too much about the age of our lawmakers – the way things are going we’ll soon all be ruled over by AI. We don’t have AI politicians yet, but there are AI girlfriend apps. Some see these as a worrying development. “Creating a perfect partner that you control and meets your every need is really frightening,” an expert in domestic violence told the Guardian. “Given what we know already, that the drivers of gender-based violence are those ingrained cultural beliefs that men can control women, that is really problematic.” Japanese city apologizes after telling pregnant women to give husbands massages Onomichi city has sparked national outrage after distributing some incredibly misogynistic flyers. “There are differences in the way men and women feel and think,” one flyer reads. “One of the reasons for this is the structural difference in the brains of men and women. It is known that men act based on theories, while women act based on emotions.” Other flyers advised pregnant women to please their husbands by making them lunch, doing the housework, giving them massages and always having “a smile on [your] face”. Former Oregon prison nurse guilty of sexually abusing nine women in custody “Tony Klein used his position of authority to prey on women in custody who were in a uniquely vulnerable position,” Oregon’s US attorney, Natalie Wight, said in a statement.

RIP Sinead O’Connor Everyone is eulogizing the brilliant musician now but let’s not forget how much she was demonized for speaking truth to power in her lifetime. Let’s not forget how many of the institutions and celebrities rushing to praise her now stood by as she was vilified for speaking out about sexual abuse in the Catholic church and injustice around the world. “You hadn’t the guts to support her when she was alive and she was looking for you,” Morrissey raged in a searing statement.

The Jamie Driscoll affair suggests otherwise | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-local-communities-jamie-driscoll-north-tyne-mayor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-local-communities-jamie-driscoll-north-tyne-mayor","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s what they do, not what they say. All opposition leaders are localists until it matters. Keir Starmer said in January he wanted to “take back control” for local communities. The Labour leader wants them to have more say over jobs, transport, energy, climate change, housing, culture, childcare and finance. He wants to liberate what is now recognised as the most centralised state in Europe. So why, now, has the Labour leader decided that the people of the North of Tyne area will not be permitted to reselect their current mayor, Jamie Driscoll, to stand for Labour at the next election? Why did he agree in March that his predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, should not be reselected as MP for Islington North? Whatever the perceived misdeeds of these two politicians, surely these are matters for their respective communities to decide on. Come to that, I notice in the past few weeks that, despite his devolution speech, Starmer wants no devolution of power over council tax rises, local housing decisions or the siting of wind turbines, among other things. Nor will he tolerate any nonsense from Scottish people about “taking back control” of Scotland. He may want to move on “from slogans to solutions”, but whose solutions? Starmer, his advisers tell us, wants to show he is in charge. He wants to alter Labour’s chemistry, changing the party from a regional and ideological coalition that includes the left and the centre into a personal hegemony. He wants to cleanse it of any association with the eras of Ed Miliband or Jeremy Corbyn and restore the firm hand of Blairism. As Tony Blair saw off Militant and clause IV when he was party leader, so today Starmer is seeing off those with whom he disagrees by vetting candidates’ lists. Nothing in democratic politics is as wayward as the transition from opposition to power. The first requires making wild promises to an electorate, the second requires refashioning them in the harsh reality of high office. Starmer is right to see Blair’s leadership of Labour in the years 1995-97 as possibly the most successful example of a political opposition since the 1940s. He delivered a genuinely reformed Labour party, stripped of its old ideological baggage, “new” and fit for government. In power, Blair’s stance on localism was much the same as Starmer’s is now. He saw elected mayors as a way of sidestepping local Labour old guards and reviving democracy. But he allowed John Prescott to stall their modest introduction and Gordon Brown at the Treasury to limit their power. Blair then maintained Margaret Thatcher’s clampdown on local finance, in much the same way that David Cameron later took control of planning and housing targets. All power centralises, but when a constitution fails to protect local democracy, power centralises absolutely. Starmer’s January speech was certainly passionate. He promised a bill in his first term to instigate “a decade of national renewal”. He would “devolve sweeping powers to local communities” and grant a new “right to request powers” beyond even those he had listed. This was to be “no catchphrase interchange” but a recognition of the desire of communities “to stand on their own feet”. Those who have laboured long in this vineyard find such phrases desperately tired. Though Starmer was all for “communities” – a word that might imply Women’s Institutes, local fetes and Dad’s Army – he never mentioned local government or local councils, as if these were the bogey words of localism. In a democracy there should be no distinction between communities and democratic institutions, yet the Labour leader did not seem capable of admitting this. So could communities really regain control of their children’s education, as they did before Thatcher? Could they fix business rates and domestic taxes to meet their description of local need? Could they recover power over local development, so communities could decide how their area looked and changed? All these powers have passed from local councils to London in the past 30 years. Will Starmer really return them? In 2019 the Institute for Public Policy Research concluded its study of regional wealth across Europe. It found that Britain had the widest division between its capital and its regions of any comparable country. This disparity appeared in the amounts that people earned, the levels of economic productivity, the availability of local services – pretty much everything. A senior Treasury official admitted recently to the Institute for Government that this was probably “the most centralised government in the developed world”. It is two years since the all-party parliamentary group on devolution reported on lockdown. The report concluded that when lockdown decisions were delegated to devolved nations and local councils, they had proven “more flexible, effective and responsive” than those decided in Whitehall. The reason was simple: “the widest range of social and economic factors are often only visible to leaders rooted in the local community”. Big national challenges needed “place-based responses”. It apparently takes a parliamentary group to discover this. We might hope that Starmer got the point, and that he really does want to “stop power being hoarded by Westminster”. The trouble is that is what they all say, until they are doing the hoarding. Even before he finds himself in Downing Street, Starmer cannot bring himself to respect the local diversity that has long been Labour’s strength. He cannot allow his party to let the people of the north-east choose who it is they want to lead them. It is a very bad start.

After a 3-1 win against Norway in the last 16 they progressed comfortably with their 100% win rate intact. Hinata Miyazawa starred once again and remains top scorer with five goals, equalling Homare Sawa’s Golden Boot-winning total in 2011, when Japan won the World Cup. 2) France (up 9) Hervé Renard’s side have clicked at the right time. Their new World Cup record goal-scorer Eugénie Le Sommer and the forward Kadidiatou Diani are stealing headlines but Kenza Dali has been hugely impressive pulling the strings in midfield, too. The 2019 hosts, who disappointed on home soil and were knocked out by USA at the quarter-final stage, have a strong chance of progressing past this year’s co-hosts Australia when they meet in the quarter-final on Saturday. 3) Australia (up 4) The Matildas have already gone one better than 2019 by reaching the quarter-final stage. In the last-16 game against Denmark the Scandinavians could not make their possession count as Australia went on to win 2-0. Mary Fowler played one of the passes of the tournament to send through Caitlin Foord for one of the goals and there were bonus minutes for Sam Kerr. 4) Colombia (up 1) After a thrilling start to the tournament Colombia were made to work hard against a Jamaica side that had not yet conceded. Catalina Usme scored a well-taken goal and the 18-year-old full-back Ana María Guzmán impressed filling in for the suspended Manuela Vanegas. It will be interesting to see who will start against England. 5) Netherlands (down 1) Andries Jonker said his side had “the conviction that we can beat everybody” as his Dutch team saw off a stern South African test in Sydney. The goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar put in a player-of-the-match performance in goal to ensure victory but Daniëlle van de Donk’s yellow card means she is out for the quarter-final against Spain. 6) Spain (up 2) Four first-half goals got Jorge Vilda’s team back to winning ways as they cruised through against Switzerland after the surprise defeat against Japan. Aitana Bonmatí starred once again with a brace and a superb performance in the midfield. The Netherlands will provide a sterner test when they meet in Wellington on Friday. 7) Sweden (down 5) Somewhat fortunate to progress past USA on penalties after the holders dominated the game. The Chelsea goalkeeper Zecira Musovic was exceptional, making 11 saves in normal time to deny the Americans. Their set-piece threat could be crucial against arguably the best team in the tournament, Japan. 8) England (down 5) The Lionesses scraped past Nigeria on penalties to make it four wins from four, but only one those results convincing. Sarina Wiegman is struggling to find her best formula, both in terms of personnel and formation. Defensively they have been very solid, Colombia will offer a sterner defensive test, though, and Lauren James is suspended. 9) Jamaica (–) It was a question of too little too late for Jamaica as they were beaten 1-0 by Colombia in Melbourne. Lorne Donaldson’s players seemed happy to rely on their defensive strength until Catalina Usme’s 51st-minute winner. Chances presented themselves to level but their ineffectiveness in front of goal meant the Reggae Girlz went out. 10) USA (up 3) The Americans were unlucky to come up against an in-form goalkeeper in Sweden’s Musovic and arguably should have wrapped the game up in normal time or extra time before the pot luck of penalties. That said, the reigning champions have whimpered out of the tournament, looking lost and tactically wanting. 11) Nigeria (down 5) After their penalty heartbreak Nigeria departed Australia despite an eye-catching campaign. Arguably the better side against England, they could not find the clinical touch needed to progress. There will be hope that impressive performances will provide a platform to build on but battles with their federation continue and uncertainty over the future of the manager, Randy Waldrum, remains. 12) Norway (up 4) It was a bit of a surprise that the Norwegians escaped the group after some underwhelming performances but there was no chance they were progressing past a slick Japan side in the last 16. A serious rethink of how to best maximise the extraordinary individual talent at their disposal, and who is best to do that, is needed. 13) Denmark (up 1) Denmark’s return to the tournament was ended by an energised Australia. The Danish side’s youthful potential was in no doubt, but this campaign was probably too early for those coming through. The Swede Andrée Jeglertz will now take over the managerial reins from Lars Søndergaard, whose tenure lasted more than five years. 14) South Africa (down 4) Played three, lost three, conceded eight, scored once. That was the South Africans’ record in their first World Cup in 2019. This time round they collected four points and progressed from the group stage. They held the Netherlands to a two-goal margin in the last 16 and have exited the competition with the progress evident despite the lack of support from the federation. 15) Switzerland (–) Inka Grings’s team never really set the tournament alight despite heading through top of Group A. They managed just two goals all campaign (plus an own goal against Spain). Attentions will now turn to Euro 2027, which they will host, with hope they can build a legacy for the future. 16) Morocco (down 4) France were always going to be a step too high for the debutants. The federation is investing, and it shows, progressing to the knockout stage ahead of the heavy favourites Germany was hugely impressive. The signs are good.

The former US president, alongside a military valet, now faces a sweeping 37-count felony indictment related to the mishandling of classified documents. Here are some of the most shocking revelations in the indictment. Trump took nuclear documents out of the White House Upon leaving the White House in January 2021, Trump took with him boxes of classified documents, including information regarding US nuclear capabilities, as well as those of a foreign country. One classified document from June 2020 contained information “concerning nuclear capabilities of a foreign country”. Investigators found another undated document “concerning nuclear weaponry of the United States”. Trump stored classified documents in the shower, among other places The former president stored boxes of classified documents in various locations at Mar-a-Lago, including an office space, his bedroom, a storage room, a bathroom, a ballroom and in the shower, according to the unsealed indictment. On 5 April 2021, a Trump employee texted a colleague to ask whether boxes in the business center could be moved to make room for staff to use it as an office. The employee responded, “We can definitely make it work if we move his papers into the lake room?” First employee: “There is still a little room in the shower where his other stuff is. Is it only his papers he cares about? Theres some other stuff in there that are not papers. Could that go to storage? Or does he want everything in there on property?” After that text exchange, some boxes containing documents were moved from the business center to a bathroom and shower in a space at the Mar-a-Lago club known as the Lake Room. Trump conspired with his valet to hide documents from attorneys Trump’s valet, Waltine Nauta, was indicted alongside his former boss for conspiring to hide classified documents from attorneys searching for them. Nauta faces six federal charges, including concealing evidence and conspiracy to obstruct justice. According to the indictment, Trump directed Nauta, who is currently a personal aide to the former president, to move boxes containing documents in order to hide them from his attorneys, the FBI and a grand jury. When questioned under oath, Nauta said he was unaware Trump held on to boxes with classified documents. That was a lie, prosecutors found during their investigation, as Trump had instructed Nauta to move them from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Trump shared secret attack plans even though he was unauthorized to do so In July 2021, Trump shared unauthorized information about his desire as president to attack a certain country and a classified conversation with a senior military official during an interview with an unnamed writer and their publisher. “Look what I found, this was [the Senior Military Official’s] plan of attack, read it and just show … it’s interesting,” Trump told the writer, the publisher and two members of his staff, acknowledging he held on to classified documents detailing the plans. None of those he spoke with had security clearances to know that information. “See as president I could have declassified it,” Trump said. “Now I can’t, you know, but this is still a secret.” “Now we have a problem,” said a staffer. Trump: “Isn’t that interesting? Trump suggested attorneys lie to DoJ about having no documents The indictment suggests when lawyers for Trump met with him to discuss how to respond to a May 2022 subpoena seeking documents marked as classified at Mar-a-Lago, Trump allegedly suggested they should tell the justice department that they had no materials that needed to be turned over. The indictment stated that Trump said: “I don’t want anybody looking, I don’t want anybody looking through my boxes, I really don’t, I don’t want you looking through my boxes.” He allegedly added: “What happens if we just don’t respond at all or don’t play ball with them?” and “Wouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/aug/07/fittest-ever-vunipola-can-give-england-world-cup-power-says-steve-borthwick","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-07T17:49:25Z","webTitle":"‘Fittest-ever’ Vunipola can give England World Cup power, says Steve Borthwick","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/07/fittest-ever-vunipola-can-give-england-world-cup-power-says-steve-borthwick","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/aug/07/fittest-ever-vunipola-can-give-england-world-cup-power-says-steve-borthwick","fields":{"bodyText":"Steve Borthwick has backed Billy Vunipola to power up England’s World Cup campaign with his captain, Owen Farrell, insisting “going under the radar” in France can work in his side’s favour. Vunipola has been out of action since April with a knee injury but is closing in on a much-needed return on Saturday as England seek to get their campaign back on track after a disappointing defeat by Wales last weekend. The 30-year-old is the only specialist No 8 in the 33-man squad but is “the fittest I’ve ever seen him”, according to Borthwick, who believes England need an injection of power to boost their World Cup chances. Vunipola is “very close” to being available to face Wales on Saturday and is set for a bumper World Cup workload with Borthwick overlooking Alex Dombrandt and Tom Willis for his squad. Insisting he was not taking a risk in not selecting a back-up specialist, however, Borthwick revealed his plan is for Vunipola to “play as much as he possibly can” in a considerable show of faith in someone he omitted throughout the Six Nations. “Billy has been fantastic in this training camp,” Borthwick said. “I’ve seen just how hard he’s worked to come back from his injury. He looks in great shape and the fittest I’ve ever seen him. “Billy is a guy who loves playing rugby so we want him to play as much as he possibly can and I think he’s desperate to play as much as he possibly can. He looks really good. And the diligence of seeing him in this recovery from injury – it has been very impressive. He’s a very mature player now. I think he’s taken a very mature approach to his recovery, and a very determined approach to be fit for this. “There’s no doubt that when I’m watching games now, a huge aspect is the power game. I watch teams play and you see teams that have that power have a real advantage. What you’ve got to be able to do is combat that. You’ve got to have a pack that can combat the power of the opposition against the top teams.” England have lost their past three matches and four of the six since Eddie Jones was sacked as head coach, dampening World Cup expectations with Borthwick refusing to say whether he believed England can win the tournament. Farrell, however, was more bullish and believes going to France with low expectations can be used to England’s advantage. “If we go in as favourites or go in under the radar, we’ll use it to our advantage either way,” he said. “We’re working away quietly. Tournament rugby is a lot about pressure. It’s bigger than anything you usually play in and there’s a lot of outside noise. We might not have as much of that, but the big thing is controlling what’s happening in camp and not worry about the external factors which don’t really matter. We will look forward to getting the best out of ourselves either way. “You go into World Cups and people talk about favourites and say: ‘It’s theirs to lose’ – but it doesn’t work like that. That’s not how sport works. Just look at the football World Cup when Argentina lost to Saudi Arabia.” Borthwick confirmed his 33-man squad on Monday with Henry Slade the shock omission and the head coach revealing that Joe Marchant’s performance in the defeat by Wales was a factor in his selection. The 33 have a combined total of 1,411 caps with 16 players who were part of the 2019 squad – 14 who appeared in the final – and in Dan Cole, Ben Youngs and Courtney Lawes, England have three players attending their fourth World Cups, with Borthwick highlighting experience as a key hallmark of his squad. “Experience at all costs is vitally important,” the head coach said. “I think that the experience in some key positions that you’ve seen in contexts of the situation has become really important now for this tournament. I think we’re averaging 40 or so caps across the squad and as a secondary point to that you have the leadership. “I think if you start looking throughout the team and unless I’m mistaken you’ve got people with that experience of an incredible amount of leadership, be it Ellis [Genge], Jamie [George], Billy [Vunipola], Tom Curry, and then I go through the team and then there’s Courtney Lawes, so we have a vast amount of leadership across the team.” There is a concerning lack of experience behind Jamie George at hooker, however, with Jack Walker and Theo Dan, who made his debut off the bench in Cardiff last week, totalling just five caps between them. Luke Cowan-Dickie is sorely missed as he recovers from a neck injury with Borthwick admitting he is closely monitoring the Sale hooker, who could yet be a standby later in the tournament. “I get regular updates around a number of players who are carrying injuries and one of them is Luke,” Borthwick said. “So I’m tracking his progress. I’ll be very clear we’d want more depth and experience in that position, but that’s the situation we have found ourselves in. That experience behind Jamie, there is a big gap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/04/restless-labour-impatient-for-power-but-questions-over-strategy-remain","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T05:00:53Z","webTitle":"Restless Labour impatient for power but questions over strategy remain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/04/restless-labour-impatient-for-power-but-questions-over-strategy-remain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jul/04/restless-labour-impatient-for-power-but-questions-over-strategy-remain","fields":{"bodyText":"In a packed school assembly hall in an inner London comprehensive on a balmy evening last week, the great and good of the Labour party gathered to celebrate the launch of the memoir of the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting. The party’s general secretary, David Evans, mingled over glasses of wine and bowls of crisps with Peter Hyman, Keir Starmer’s senior aide, Deborah Mattinson, Labour’s director of strategy, and a host of other Labour MPs, political journalists and party officials. Streeting joked to the crowded room at Westminster City school, his old sixth form, that autobiographies were usually written at the end of careers. The impatient atmosphere in the room, however, suggested he and shadow cabinet colleagues may well be at the start of theirs. For the last few months, Conservative opinion poll rankings have been heading downwards, with support falling to its lowest level in more than four months last week as voters appeared to penalise Rishi Sunak and his government for inflation and interest rate rises. The prime minister’s small boats plan is snarled up in the courts and his own MPs are engaged in daily bouts of blue on blue, while just offstage Boris Johnson hovers, causing ripples of anxiety for those Tories who still believe they have a chance at the election. Yet those at the top of the Labour party are taking nothing for granted. While they recognise that they are likely, at the very least, to be the biggest party after polling day, Starmer’s team remain nervous. “There is absolutely no room for complacency,” one senior adviser scolds. “We still have a long way to go”. Some Labour MPs worry they are on course to win on the back of votes against the Tories, rather than for Labour. There are, of course, others that don’t care as long as they get to No 10. But a decent majority and a second term are unlikely to follow unless they get the right balance between economic reality and inspiration. Party strategists believe they face two main challenges over the next year and a bit to persuade the country that they can offer both economic certainty – or “securonomics” as they like to call it – and a brighter future. One is that after years of over-promising but underdelivering on things like levelling up and Brexit, the public is sceptical of promises from politicians from right across the political spectrum. “They’re all the same,” is one regular refrain in focus groups. The other is that the economic picture means there’s little money for big spending commitments – even if they wanted to make them – so Labour wouldn’t be able to ride to the rescue of cash-starved public services. That’s a difficult message to sell to voters. Not a day seems to go by without Labour dropping – or delaying – a policy pledge. The £28bn green jobs fund, scrapping tuition fees and raising taxes for the top 5% of earners have all been affected. Party officials point out the country is in a different place after the pandemic, Ukraine, Trussonomics and the cost of living crisis. Yet it is a vulnerability, building on Johnson’s joke about Starmer having “more flip-flops than Bournemouth beach”. At PMQs last week, Sunak attacked the Labour leader for “never actually keeping a promise he’s made”. It has also angered many of those who backed him to be leader in the first place, with the leftwing Momentum group accusing Labour of being “allergic” to good policy. Senior Labour figures, however, are more concerned about whether voters know what Starmer does stand for – rather than what he does not. One shadow cabinet minister admits there is still a “central tension” over how he is defined, despite four of his five policy “missions” already being published. “He has to stand for something,” they say. “But the public still struggle to put their finger on what that is”. Officials close to Starmer believe the sceptics – internal and otherwise – will be proved wrong. They describe the missions, which broadly cover the economy, environment, NHS, crime and education, as the “ladder” to what he would deliver in government. They will form the basis of what Labour will provide to Whitehall departments and key stakeholders as a template for government should it win the election. “It’s about how we deliver, as well as what,” says one senior aide. They will also, along with ideas agreed by the party’s national policy forum later this month, feed into the election manifesto machine, which will pull together the most eye-catching “retail” offers. Some of these will be announced at the autumn conference, with the rest held back until nearer polling day. Starmer’s allies insist that he is a problem solver, rather than a technocrat, and will take the tough decisions needed to deliver. “We know we’ve still got work to do, but we have a plan for the next year. Everybody just has to be patient,” said one adviser. Yet, as the restlessness at Streeting’s book launch last week showed, few in the Labour party or across its support base more broadly are willing to heed that advice. Questions over Starmer’s strategy will continue right up until the moment election day brings its answer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/27/netanyahu-and-trump-two-desperate-men-exploiting-power-to-save-themselves","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-27T07:30:29Z","webTitle":"Netanyahu and Trump: two desperate men exploiting power to save themselves","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/netanyahu-and-trump-two-desperate-men-exploiting-power-to-save-themselves","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/27/netanyahu-and-trump-two-desperate-men-exploiting-power-to-save-themselves","fields":{"bodyText":"When Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to ensure his re-election four years ago, he turned to Donald Trump. Or, to be exact, to giant billboards of the then US president putting on his least threatening smile as he shook hands with the Israeli prime minister, under the Hebrew caption: “Netanyahu: in a different league”. Trump’s endorsement was a win for the man who has been Israel’s prime minister longer than any other. The US president was popular with Israelis for thumbing his nose at longstanding Washington policies by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognising Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights. Trump’s standing in Israel, at 71% approval for his handling of international affairs, was higher than in almost any other country. But as much as many Israelis liked Trump, few foresaw the extent to which their own prime minister would prove as willing to turn a personal crisis into a national one in order to save his own skin. “The driving priority for both Trump and Netanyahu is their own personal interests,” said Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace Now, sister organisation to the Israeli peace movement. “The creation of this most extreme government in Israel’s history was about keeping Netanyahu in power and hence out of jail.” Both men are in a fight to stay out of prison. Federal and state charges are stacking up against Trump; Netanyahu is in the middle of a corruption trial that has already lasted more than three years. And power gives the pair the best prospect of avoiding justice. Trump proved his willingness to launch populist attacks on the institutions of state throughout his presidency, culminating in his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result and his part in rousing a mob to storm the Capitol. If he returns to power, Americans can expect a full-on assault on the independence of the judicial system and Department of Justice. Netanyahu has gone a different route by forging a coalition with some of the most extreme ultranationalist parties in Israel, even if he does not share some of their views, such as their hostility to LGBTQ rights. Their leaders are unashamedly racist about Arabs and open about their ambitions to annex some or all of the occupied territories, and make permanent the Israeli dominance over the Palestinians. The coalition is pushing ahead with legislation to curb the power of Israel’s judiciary that has prompted some of the biggest demonstrations in the country’s history and a deep political crisis. The first stage passed on Monday, when Israel’s parliament voted to limit the supreme court’s ability to overturn laws. Netanyahu and his allies have a common interest in weakening the power of the courts. It gives him a chance of avoiding prison while removing what the far right fears will be a block on its ambitions for a Greater Israel. But if Trump and Netanyahu are two desperate men hoping to exploit their power to save themselves at the expense of their countries, there are important differences. For a start, when Americans elected Trump as president in 2016, they knew exactly what kind of political leader they were getting – even if he proved more destabilising and seditious than some supporters expected. In contrast, Aaron David Miller, who knows Netanyahu from his time as a US Middle East peace negotiator during several administrations, said the Israeli prime minister is not the same politician he was a few years ago. “He’s no longer the risk-averse, cautious Israeli politician who takes one step forward and two steps back. Who respects public opinion. Who’s tough but coerces within the lines. Now he is risk-ready and desperate and in many respects, he has lost control. He’s driven by the fact that if elections were held tomorrow, someone else could put together a government and he’d be vulnerable to what he really cares about, which is the existential problem of his trial,” he said. Susskind said that even some of Netanyahu’s supporters have been surprised by the extent to which he has been prepared to subvert the system to protect himself. “He used to be, for lack of a more precise term, like a normal politician. He was cautious about things and did try to reach consensus. Right now, we are seeing the acts of a desperate man.” No one ever accused Trump of being a normal politician; the US is still living with the consequences of his presidency. But Netanyahu may have been the more damaging leader over the longer term, going back to the assassination of the then prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, in 1995. As leader of the opposition, he led rallies to oppose Rabin’s peace accords with the Palestinians at which the prime minister was portrayed in a Nazi uniform amid chants of “Death to Rabin”. Rabin’s widow, Leah, accused Netanyahu of being the ringmaster in whipping up the incitement that led to her husband’s murder. Seven months after the assassination, Netanyahu was elected to his first term on his way to becoming Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. His critics drew on a biblical phrase – “murdered and also inherited” – to condemn him. Susskind said Israel is still living with that legacy. “He has driven Israel to where it is, in terms of inciting hatred within the society. I think more than anybody else he’s responsible for that,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/jun/07/power-hungry-hedonists-survey-reveals-what-drives-generation-z","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T23:01:21Z","webTitle":"Power-hungry hedonists?

It may not be entirely reassuring to learn, then, that a landmark global study has found that while the idea of generational divides is largely overblown, the so-called generation Z are evidently clear-eyed in their desire for power, achievement, hedonism and stimulation. Born between 1997 and 2012, gen Z is the largest generation in the world, with an annual purchasing power of $100bn globally. They will make up 27% of the global workforce by 2025 as they take over the reins of the world economy from millennials (born between 1981 and 1996), gen X (1965 to 1981), boomers (1946 to 1964) and the silent generation (1925 to 1945). No such age cohort is homogenous, and the differences between the generations were largely found to be comparatively small. However, the values driving gen Z are said to have stood out in a survey of 36,000 people in 30 countries, commissioned by the strategic communications consultancy BCW. When it comes to being very successful and people recognising their achievements, 44% of the age cohort said it was important to them. This compared with 37% of millennials who felt the same, 23% of gen X, 13% of boomers and 14% of the silent generation. A similar proportion (43%) of gen Z said it was “important to them to do things that can give them pleasure” and that they “seek every chance they can to have fun”. The proportion fell to 38% of the millennials and 27% of gen X. About a third (32%) of gen Z said it was important to be rich, compared with 26% of millennials and 16% of gen X. A similar ratio of gen Z said they wanted to have an exciting lifestyle – compared with 32% of millennials and 20% of gen X. Lisa Story, BCW’s chief strategy officer, said the increased focus on the individual evidenced by the results was a continuation of a trend that could be seen across the century and which had been potentially exacerbated by the rise of social media. She said: “If you look at the values [of gen Z] – power achievement, hedonism, stimulation – that’s a really interesting set because typically, people aren’t that comfortable with saying that they have those values. “So that is unusual. The fact that gen Z is largely living its life in a very public environment in which your social status [is public], the degree to which you’re successful, whether that is in a general lifestyle sense or whether it’s do with your work, I think that probably does create an environment where those values are very much more in play than they would have been without that technology and that platform.” The suggestion that those in gen Z are hedonistic might seem counterintuitive to some, with reports suggesting that British youngsters, for example, are eschewing alcohol. Story suggested that those in the younger age range may have a different understanding of pleasure than the older generations. She said: “The values are consistent, but they’re very different for different people in different environments. So, to be hedonistic, might be about … [for instance] going for a really good run and meeting friends for a juice at the end of it.” BCW’s report – Age of Values 2023, one of the largest studies of its kind – was based on Prof Shalom H Schwartz’s theory of basic universal values that serve as guiding principles for all human behaviour. The online survey took place between December 2022 and April 2023. The report suggests that people around the world remain above all else to be social animals “hard wired to cooperation with each other and avoid dispute or discord”. The top three values with which respondents indicated an allegiance were benevolence, universalism (the principle of tolerance for all) and security. Only a quarter of people said they strongly agreed that their governments’ policies and programmes aligned with their own values. Regionally, only 14% of people in southern Europe, 15% in northern Europe and 17% in the English-speaking world (Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US) believed they were in sync with their government. In the UK just 12% of people firmly believe that their government shares their values."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/28/new-zealand-may-join-aukus-pacts-non-nuclear-component","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T03:11:17Z","webTitle":"New Zealand may join Aukus pact’s non-nuclear component","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/new-zealand-may-join-aukus-pacts-non-nuclear-component","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/28/new-zealand-may-join-aukus-pacts-non-nuclear-component","fields":{"bodyText":"New Zealand’s government has confirmed it is discussing joining the non-nuclear part of the Aukus alliance founded by Australia, the UK and US. “We have been offered the opportunity to talk about whether we could or wish to participate in that pillar two [non-nuclear] aspect of it,” said Andrew Little, the New Zealand defence minister. “I’ve indicated we will be willing to explore it.” It comes a week after New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, visited top Chinese diplomats, who raised concerns at the military tie-up between Australia, the UK and the US, which is centred on Australia receiving nuclear-powered navy submarines. A second “pillar” to the three-part deal covers the sharing of advanced military technologies, including quantum computing and artificial intelligence. New Zealand has not been offered the chance to join pillar one, nor would it accept, due to its anti-nuclear position. Little said any Aukus membership “could not compromise our legal obligations and our moral commitment to nuclear-free”. “[Aukus membership] would be about the kind of technology … needed to protect defence personnel,” he said. “Usually domain awareness, so surveillance technology, and radio technology that allows us to do that.” Little met this month with Kurt Campbell, the US national security coordinator for the Indo-Pacific region. During her visit to Beijing last week, Mahuta said, Chinese officials made clear their concerns. “They acknowledged our position on the matter. We’re not a part of those arrangements,” Mahuta said. New Zealand has other concerns about Aukus, including that it may jeopardise the treaty of Rarotonga, which designates large areas of the Pacific free of nuclear weapons. “Our concern is not to see the militarisation of the Pacific, that the treaty of Rarotonga be upheld, and that’s the basis upon which our assurances from Australia have been gained in relation to those arrangements,” Mahuta said. China is strongly against Aukus, with foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin outlining China’s “severe concern and firm opposition”. It is not clear whether China holds the same concerns regarding non-nuclear parts of Aukus. Last week, the New Zealand opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Gerry Brownlee, raised his own concerns about whether Aukus might make it harder for Anzac forces to operate together. On Tuesday, he walked back his comments, saying he was “certainly not” trying to criticise the deal. “Australia will make decisions for Australia,” Brownlee said. Little said foreign or local voices against the deal would not be a factor in potential membership. “We as a country and the leaders of the day have to make an assessment about our long-term best interests and what is a rapidly changing world and a rapidly changing region.” The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark has said it is not in New Zealand’s interests to be associated with Aukus.

The election, in which the opposition conservative People’s party is expected to finish first but fall short of an absolute majority, has been closely and bitterly fought. Although the PP is topping the polls and its leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, emerged as the surprise winner of a head-to-head debate last week with Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the PP’s campaign has had a poor final few days. Feijóo, who had already been left looking awkward after his claims about the PP’s track record on pensions turned out to be untrue, then made an apparent reference to the makeup of Spain’s deputy prime minister and labour minister, Yolanda Díaz, which was criticised for its sexist tone. The PP leader is also facing renewed questions over his old friendship with a man who was later convicted of drug trafficking. Speaking on Friday, Feijóo accused his opponents of trying to smear him, adding that when he knew him, the man in question “had been a smuggler [but] never a drug trafficker”. Sunday’s vote was called by Sánchez after his ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) and its smaller coalition partners in the Unidas Podemos alliance did far worse than expected in May’s regional and municipal elections. According to the polls, the PP, which last governed between 2011 and 2018, is all but assured to win the most votes but forecast to fall short of the 176-seat majority required in Spain’s 350-seat congress. That means any future PP-led government is likely to require the support of the far-right Vox party, which is currently the third biggest grouping in congress, and with which the PP has already formed a handful or regional coalition governments. Sánchez has sought to portray Sunday’s vote as a showdown between the forces of progress and the forces of reactionary conservatism, claiming that only the PSOE and its allies in Díaz’s new, leftwing Sumar alliance, which include Podemos, can deliver and defend a progressive agenda. The prime minister has also accused the PP of legitimising Vox’s denial of human-driven climate change and gender-based violence by cutting deals with the far-right party. “There’s something that’s far more dangerous than Vox, and that’s having a PP that assumes the policies and postures of Vox,” Sánchez said in a recent interview with El País. “And that’s what we’re seeing: a denialism when it comes to social, political and scientific consensus.” The PP has accused the prime minister and his partners of failing Spaniards through a badly botched reform of sexual offences legislation that has seen more than 100 convicted sex offenders granted early release, and of seeking to defend the political brand it calls “sanchismo” by clinging to power at any cost. “First and foremost, the PP represents indispensable, vital political change in Spain,” Feijóo told the ABC newspaper on Friday. “The PP is about doing away with sanchismo in Spain … We’re a constitutional party, a party that believes in liberal democracy and the market economy, a party that believes in properly functioning public services, which knows that fiscal pressure can’t keep rising indefinitely, and a party that wants to attract foreign investment and keep Spanish investment in Spain.” Feijóo has criticised Sánchez’s minority coalition government for being beholden to the Catalan and Basque separatist parties on whom its depends for support in parliament. He has also said he intends to repeal a number of the laws passed by the Sánchez administration, including one on transgender rights and another intended to deal with the legacy of the Franco dictatorship. An Ipsos poll for La Vanguardia this month found that the economy was the single biggest issue for voters, with 31% of those surveyed putting it at the top of their list. Then came unemployment (10%) and healthcare (9%). Immigration, one of Vox’s favourite talking points, was the most important issue for just 2% of those polled. Sumar is hoping to win over voters with a green agenda, the promise of a €20,000 (£17,100) “universal inheritance” for young Spaniards when they turn 18 – and blunt warnings about a PP-Vox government. “On 23 July, Spain will decide between two kinds of government – two coalitions,” Díaz said earlier this month. “The coalition of rights, freedom and progress – a coalition of us and the Socialist party – and the coalition of hatred, which rejects the rights of women and LGBT people, and which pits businesses against workers.” Vox, meanwhile, is hoping its focus on culture wars, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and push to defend the interests of rural Spain will finally help propel it into government following its breakthrough into national politics four years ago. “Pedro Sánchez will be remembered as the prime minister who was hard and implacable when it came to honest Spaniards and soft when it came to criminals, the enemies of Spain and foreign elites,” Vox says in its manifesto."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/12/italy-judiciary-power-struggle-far-right-government-giorgia-meloni","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-12T04:00:00Z","webTitle":"‘It’s absurd’: Italy’s judiciary in power struggle with far-right government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/12/italy-judiciary-power-struggle-far-right-government-giorgia-meloni","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/12/italy-judiciary-power-struggle-far-right-government-giorgia-meloni","fields":{"bodyText":"Italy’s far-right government is embroiled in a power struggle with magistrates amid controversial investigations involving leading figures within the ruling coalition. In a memo citing sources from the office of the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, a “segment of the judiciary” came under attack “for choosing to play an active opposition role” in allegedly attempting to bring down her administration ahead of next year’s European parliamentary elections. Tensions have been simmering between the two powers since allegations emerged regarding the business activities of the tourism minister, Daniela Santanchè, a close Meloni aide, leading to calls for her resignation. Santanchè denied she was being investigated during an address to parliament last week. However, judicial sources confirmed soon after the speech that she had been under investigation since October for bankruptcy and false accounting claims involving her publishing group, Visibilia. “I never appropriated anything that does not belong to me, I have never abused my top positions in companies. I defy anyone to prove otherwise,” she said. A judge also came under fire from the government after refusing a request from the public prosecutor to shelve a case involving Andrea Delmastro, an official from Meloni’s Brothers of Italy, a party with neofascist roots. Delmastro was accused of breaching secrecy rules after speaking out in parliament in relation to Alfredo Cospito, an anarchist jailed under a harsh regime usually reserved for mafia bosses. Meanwhile, Ignazio La Russa, the president of the upper house and a Brothers of Italy co-founder, provoked controversy after casting doubt on rape allegations made by a woman against his son. Maurizio Gasparri, a politician with the late Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, accused the judiciary of “attacking the constitution”. But magistrates have hit back, arguing that the “false” accusations against them undermine trust in the judiciary. “To do this merely because a judge is doing his job conscientiously and is dealing with a case which happens to concern a politician … means delegitimising the judiciary,” Salvatore Casciaro, the secretary of the magistrates’ union, ANM, told Rai Radio 1. Meloni’s government is trying to push through judicial changes, including limiting the use of wiretapping and abolishing the crime of abuse of office, both of which have been criticised by magistrates. The government is also seeking to separate the career paths of judges and prosecutors so they can no longer switch from one job to the other, a measure described by some magistrates as a way to “punish the judiciary”. Carlo Sorgi, a retired magistrate, said: “It’s inevitable that this rightwing government, not being within legal parameters, clashes with those who have to enforce the legal parameters. When a case emerges [against one of their own] they feel scandalised. It’s absurd, but in reality they are attacking magistrates because they want faith in magistrates to be weakened in public opinion.” Magistrates have often been accused of siding with the left by Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, who is embroiled in a trial for alleged kidnapping – which he denies – after refusing to let refugees disembark from a rescue ship in Sicily when he was interior minister in 2019. “This row has been going on for 30 years,” said Gian Domenico Caiazza, the chair of the Italian defence attorneys’ association. “There is an imbalance between the judiciary powers and the political ones. It’s not a problem of left or rightwing, it’s a systematic issue … and each time a case emerges that hits a minister or undersecretary it touches a nerve.” Elly Schlein, the leader of the centre-left opposition Democratic party, has criticised Meloni for remaining silent over the investigations, especially that involving Santanchè, who is accused of Covid benefit fraud as well as failing to pay suppliers and of firing staff without giving them redundancy payments. “It is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic system that, instead of responding to the serious accusations on the merits, Palazzo Chigi [the prime minister’s office] fuels a dangerous clash between the powers of the state by circulating a note with intimidating tones towards the judiciary.” Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a political consultancy in Rome, said: “This is a power struggle … you have one power that thinks it has a strong mandate which wants to suck the air out of another, which is hitting back, and it’s hitting where it hurts. The question now is how long it will take to reach a climax … and whether it could destabilise the government before the EU elections or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","fields":{"bodyText":"It is 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed: Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he told the news agency. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. That is all for today. Thank you for reading along. We will be back bringing you the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed that a team of independent inspectors can travel to the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow’s forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant in south Ukraine not to disconnect the facility from the grid and potentially cut supplies to millions of Ukrainians. The United States Defence Department on Friday announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. “We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that’s what we’re doing with this package,” a senior US defence official told reporters. The official said Ukraine’s forces have made good use of the now 19 packages of arms the United States has provided since Moscow invaded on February 24. Swiss prosecutors have been asked by an Ukrainian NGO to investigate an alleged attack on a Swiss photojournalist by Russian troops in Ukraine earlier this year, AFP reported on Friday. The NGO Truth Hounds asked Switzerland’s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to probe an attack on Swiss freelance journalist Guillaume Briquet in southern Ukraine in March as a possible war crime, according to the Swiss-based Civitas Maxima group that helped it file the complaint. In a statement to AFP, the OAG confirmed that it had received the complaint and said it would “now be examined according to usual procedure”, stressing that a complaint did not automatically mean it would launch an investigation. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Kramatorsk, which is in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russia has submitted a letter to the United Nations Security Council warning of planned “provocations” by Ukraine at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a diplomat. The letter repeated Russia’s previous claim that Kyiv was planning a “provocation” at the plant on Friday, TASS reported. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia in March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. The plant has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. The United States is poised to announce it will provide Ukraine with nearly $800m (£678m) in new military aid on Friday, including at least a dozen surveillance drones, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press to discuss the aid ahead of its public release. They said the bulk of the aid package will be additional Howitzers (long-range weapons) and ammunition. Two officials confirmed the new inclusion of portable, long-endurance drones which are launched by a catapult and can be retrieved. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. France has now released a statement on Macron’s call with Putin. It says the French president “once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” and argued for the IAEA experts to attend the plant “as soon as possible”. Putin, the Élysée says, supported this idea. The statement continued: The two presidents will talk to each other again in the coming days on this subject, after discussions between the technical teams and before the deployment of the mission. Russian president Vladimir Putin and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have just finished a phone call about the situation in Ukraine, Moscow has said. In a Kremlin readout of the call, reported by Reuters, Putin said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which he blamed on Kyiv, created the risk of “large-scale catastrophe”. Reuters adds: Both presidents agree on the need to send a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the plant. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron about continuing obstacles to supplying Russian food and fertiliser products to world markets. The UN, Ukraine and western officials have all expressed concerns about Russia’s maintenance of the nuclear plant. The Kyiv Independent reports that it is the first time Macron and Putin have spoken since May. Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on Friday that it was taking punitive measures against a string of foreign IT companies, including TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. In a statement, Roskomnadzor said the measures were in response to the companies’ failure to remove content that it had flagged as illegal, and would remain in place until they complied. It did not specify what measures would be taken. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2m roubles (£28,635) and the messenger service Telegram 11m roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. On 29 July, the media watchdog targeted Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, and demanded that its website and print edition be stripped of its licence. Ukraine’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Friday. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. Western officials said on Friday they were concerned whether water cooling can be maintained at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently held by the Russians, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. The existing reactor cooling system, critical to the safety of the site, relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. One Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the issue we are concerned about is water cooling of the nuclear reactors” and that it was “a situation we should all be watching very closely”. But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site “able to operate and mitigate against this”. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost after an earthquake and a tsunami overwhelmed the back-up generators on site. The loss of cooling was enough to lead to a partial reactor meltdown. The western official said that fighting around the plant was considered a far lesser risk because nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impacts with thick walling. “They are built to be able to cope with a civilian airline crashing into them,” the official said, and added that “direct fires” such as artillery was “not our immediate concern”. But they would not comment on whether they believed Russia was deliberately staging forces at the site, or was preparing a false flag operation, other than to note that “both sides are contesting the information environment”. Social media videos appeare to show Russian forces basing themselves on the site. Olexander, a former worker at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station wrote an account of living in Enerhodar, a satellite city for the plant, for the Guardian. I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But they are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. Read the rest of the piece here: The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh reported on Friday that “significant efforts” are being made “to understand if Ukraine can mount a successful counter attack in the south”. Tweeting from a “western officials” briefing, Sabbagh added that “such attacks are not without risk”. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not to cut the nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so. “Obviously the electricity from Zaporizhzhia is Ukrainian electricity … This principle must be fully respected,” said the UN secretary general during a visit to the port of Odesa in southern Ukraine. The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeting live from a briefing on Friday, said the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. He added, from the briefing, that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “should be able to withstand most direct military fire. Built strong enough to resist impact of a civilian airliner. Concerns focused around whether the plant suffers a loss of cooling due to the loss of back-up electricity.” Concerns around shelling near the plant, the largest in Europe, have been growing since it was taken over by Russian forces in March. It is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. A former mayor of a Russian city has been appointed to head a Russian-installed government in north-east Ukraine, the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Andrei Alekseyenko resigned as mayor of Krasnodar on Thursday. He will now head a new Russian-appointed council of ministers in the Kharkiv province, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a decree by the local Russian-installed administration. Russian officials have previously said that occupied areas of Ukraine will never return to Kyiv’s control, and that referendums on their accession to Russia may be held in the autumn. Ukraine has called them “pseudo-referendums” and vowed to prevent them. Italian newspapers have issued front-page warnings of alleged Russian interference in the upcoming election on Friday. This comes as a response to comments from Russia’s former president urging Europeans to “punish” their “stupid” governments, AFP reports. The former president and current deputy chair of Russia’s security council, Dmitry Medvedev, on Thursday called for Europeans to be “not only outraged at the actions of their governments ... but to hold them to account and punish them for their obvious stupidity”. “Act, European neighbours! Don’t remain silent! Demand accountability!” he said on Telegram. Following Medvedev’s comments, la Repubblica and il Messaggero front pages on Friday wrote of Russian “interference”, while the Corriere della Sera said Russia was “agitating” political waters ahead of the vote due to be held on 25 September. Rishi Sunak has called on the G20 to bar the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from its summit until Moscow halts the war in Ukraine, his spokesperson told Reuters on Friday. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are said to be attending G20, which will be held on the island of Bali in November, according to earlier reports from Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. “Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep,” a spokesperson for the former chancellor told Reuters. They added: “We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine.” Sunak is currently trailing behind the foreign secretary, Liz Truss , in polls in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. In a televised debate on 25 July, Truss said it would be important to confront Putin in front of Russia’s allies. She said:, “I would go there, and I would call Putin out.” As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It’s 11am in the UK and 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything that’s happened so far today: The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases, after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. According to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reports. There were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”, a report by the Institute for the Study of War, has found. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in the Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The head of Kharkiv Oblast police, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said there are currently 19 people confirmed dead, including a child, and 20 injured, with the death toll expected to rise after Russian rockets struck two hostel dormitories. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. The summit, initiated by Ukraine, will be available to watch live on Nato’s website. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Russians have realised that Crimea is “not a place for them” and hinted more attacks could lie ahead. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. According to the Kyiv Independent, Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to the head of the Russian occupation government in Ukraine’s Crimea, posted on the social media app Telegram that the Russian military had destroyed a target in the city of Kerch, which is linked to Russia’s Krasnodar Krai via the strategic Crimean Bridge. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office, said on 17 August that the Crimean Bridge should be destroyed. The Kyiv Independent reports that according to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats. A new report from the The Institute for the Study of War, a non-profit research organisation in the US has found there were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as the chief of Russia’s radiation, chemical and biological defence forces, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, claimed on 18 August in a briefing that “Ukrainian forces are preparing for a provocation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the provocation is meant to coincide with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres’s visit to Ukraine”. It is 9am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov said a residential building was damaged and another building caught fire. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting about 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Multiple rocket launchers and generally inaccurate area weapons have caused devastation across large parts of the city. Russian forces continue to conduct local raids and probing attacks against Ukrainian forces, the ministry added. They are probably trying to force Ukraine to maintain significant forces on this front, to prevent them from being employed as a counter-attack force elsewhere.” Studying in Kryvyi Rih in the 1990s, Ukraine’s wartime leader often skipped class to focus on his standup, our correspondent Luke Harding reports from Zelenskiy’s hometown. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,” Andrii Shaikan, rector of the state university in Zelenskiy’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, said. Read the full story below. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Indonesia is chairing the Group of 20 major economies and has faced pressure from Western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin over his country’s invasion on Ukraine, which his government calls a “special military operation”. Jokowi has sought to position himself as mediator between the warring countries, and has travelled to meet both Ukraine’s and Russia’s presidents. This week, Jokowi said both countries have accepted Indonesia as a “bridge of peace”. Leaders of major countries, including US president Joe Biden, are set to meet in Indonesia’s resort island of Bali in November. Indonesia has also invited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Guardian correspondent Luke Harding came upon a mural of outgoing UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, while reporting in the southern Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, the home town of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The design – created by a collective from Odesa – shows a mop-haired Johnson giving a thumbs up. The mural’s artist, Anastasia Scherba, said she was grateful to Johnson for supporting Ukraine and giving it weapons. “He’s cool,” she said Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent newspaper cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov reported that Kharkiv’s Kyivskyi, Osnovyanskyi, and Nemyshlianskyi districts were affected. A residential building was damaged and another unspecified building caught fire as a result of the shelling. One person has been reported injured so far. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to have hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. “As of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv … and 42 people have been injured,” Synehubov said, describing the attacks as “an act of terrorism”. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. At least four explosions hit near the major Belbek airbase, north of Sevastopol in the occupied Crimean peninsula. The pro-Russia governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said: “There is no damage. No one was hurt.” Air defences were also activated near Kerch, the city at the Crimean end of a bridge to mainland Russia, which is a strategically vital supply route that many in Ukraine would like to see destroyed. Local media said a Ukrainian drone was shot down. Amid fears that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, world leaders have called to urgently secure the site. The UN secretary general called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added: We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl.” Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant they control. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN secretary general’s visit to Ukraine, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When António Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. Jeremy Fleming, the intelligence head, said both countries have been using their cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine. In an op-ed in The Economist on Friday, he wrote: So far, president Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west. Although that’s cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world. Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The country’s use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.” Fleming said Russia had deployed WhisperGate malware to destroy and deface Ukrainian government systems. He also said Russia has used the same playbook before on Syria and the Balkans and said online disinformation is a major part of Russia’s strategy. However, the GCHQ has been able to intercept and to provide warnings in time, he said. Without going into much detail, Fleming said the UK’s National Cyber Force could respond to Russia by deploying a UK military unit that employs offensive cyber tools. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the site and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” It is 7am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added. At least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate Russian attacks on Kharkiv, according to its regional governor. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. “As of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv … and 42 people have been injured,” Oleh Synehubov said, describing the attacks as “an act of terrorism”. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. The Russian military announced that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy took over a major news conference after becoming irked by a interpreter’s failure to translate his comments properly into English. Zelenskiy acted after the interpreter cut short his remarks during an event with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and United Nations secretary general António Guterres. Zelenskiy confirmed that Ukraine has not changed its position on peace negotiations, saying talks with Russia are only possible if Russian forces leave illegally occupied territory in Ukraine. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russians, its government said. Estonia’s foreign minister also defended his country’s decision to bar Russian tourists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Did Vietnam peace protests stop Nixon using nuclear weapons?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/27/vietnam-war-documentary-nixon-nuclear-weapons-pbs","fields":{"bodyText":"A new documentary about demonstrations against the Vietnam war in late 1969 argues that the hundreds of thousands who filled the streets in Washington and almost every major US city convinced Richard Nixon to abandon a plan to sharply escalate the war, including the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons. The Movement and The “Madman” will air on PBS on Tuesday. Produced and directed by the veteran documentarian Stephen Talbot, it evokes a peak moment of 1960s activism – and the “absolute disconnection” between what Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, were “deciding to do and the human costs of it, whether it’s to our own soldiers or [Vietnamese] civilians”. Those costs “had absolutely no part of their thinking” said the historian Carolyn Eisenberg. “They don’t care.” Talbot’s sure eye for searing images is matched by a perfect ear for songs. His soundtrack includes anti-establishment hymns by Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, Jimi Hendrix and Judy Collins, plus the essential anti-war anthem, I-Feel-Like-I’m Fixin’-to-Die Rag, which became world famous after Country Joe McDonald performed it at Woodstock in summer 1969. The one thing the documentary does not do is provide any convincing evidence that the demonstrations prevented the use of nuclear weapons. “It is a serious look at how one major demonstration was organized,” said Thomas Powers, author of The War at Home, a history of the anti-war movement; The Man Who Kept the Secrets, a widely admired biography of the former CIA director Richard Helms; and seven other books. But as far as the idea that “a real danger of the use of atomic weapons was prevented [by the Vietnam Moratorium] – I think that’s just plain wrong”, Powers told the Guardian. Talbot responded that declassified documents about Operation Duck Hook, which laid out options for Nixon, included the possible use of nuclear weapons as well as the mining of Haiphong harbor and the bombing of dykes that would have caused massive civilian casualties. As to whether Nixon seriously considered the nuclear option, Talbot said: “I literally don’t know and I don’t think anyone could say for sure. But it was on the table.” The “madman” of Talbot’s film is Nixon. One thing that is not in dispute is that the president worked hard to convince the North Vietnamese and the Russians he was crazy enough to do anything, including pulling the nuclear trigger, if Hanoi refused his demands to withdraw from the south. As Stephen Bull, a former Nixon aide, explains in the film, his boss wanted the Russians to “think that he was a madman. However, my personal observation was, it was a bluff. He was never going to use nuclear weapons, but he wanted the threat to be out there to force them to the table.” Powers likened Nixon’s threats to use nuclear bombs to Vladimir Putin’s current threats to use such weapons against Ukraine – which Powers doesn’t think are serious either. Talbot agreed that was a possibility. In his memoirs, Nixon wrote: “Although publicly I continued to ignore the raging anti-war controversy, I had to face the fact that it had probably destroyed the credibility of my ultimatum to Hanoi.” The other thing the demonstrations almost certainly accomplished was the passage of a law, signed by Nixon in November 1969, which created a draft lottery. On 1 December 1969, every draft-eligible young man born between 1944 and 1950 was assigned a number based on his birth date, from one to 365. The following year, the Pentagon announced that no one with a number higher than 195 would be drafted. A year later that number dropped to 125, then to 95 the year after that. Since everyone in the streets in 1969 was demonstrating in no small part because of an acute desire to avoid dying in what they considered a pointless conflict, the lottery had an immediate effect in reducing the number who felt a sense of urgency about the war. If you had a high enough number, your life was no longer in danger. After the very first lottery, more than a third of those previously subject to the draft no longer felt any imminent jeopardy. So there was less self-interest to propel the anti-war protests. Talbot agreed that the lottery was a direct result of the anti-war demonstrations, and said he included it in an earlier, longer version of his film – but it did not make the final cut. In fall 1969, he was a senior in college. He went to DC to make his first film, March on Washington, which became his senior thesis when he attended Wesleyan University. “I used clips from my first student film for this documentary,” he told the Guardian. The truth is, while the Vietnam demonstrations did reduce the dangers of the draft, there is almost no evidence they shortened the war. When Nixon took office, 31,000 Americans had been killed in Vietnam, plus hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese. By the time the last American combat troops left in March 1973, two months after the draft was abolished, 58,220 US soldiers had died – plus as many as 2 million Vietnamese civilians and 1.3 million Vietnamese soldiers.

The firm made a pre-tax profit of £1.1bn in the UK last year, before one-off items, a recovery from a loss of £21m a year earlier. EDF, which runs Britain’s nuclear power stations, said the profit was related to stronger operational performance of its nuclear fleet, and higher energy prices. The company is building Britain’s newest nuclear reactor, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which has been hit by delays and climbing costs. The cost of the project was originally set at £18bn, before it was later put at £25bn to £26bn. On Friday, EDF said that £25bn to £26bn remained the estimated cost based on 2015 calculations but “the estimated nominal cost at completion could reach £32.7bn” because of inflation. The company, which is mostly state-owned but is being fully nationalised in France, is the UK’s fourth-largest energy supplier, providing gas and electricity to more than 5m UK households. EDF said Britain’s cap on energy bills hit earnings at its energy supply business, which made a loss of £200m. The company said this was because it cost it more to buy energy to supply to its residential customers than the price it was allowed to charge them under the energy price cap. The UK profit was a rare bright spot for EDF in its annual results, which reported a record net loss of €17.9bn (£16bn) for the whole group in 2022, as its nuclear output plunged to a 34-year low after a record number of outages at its reactors in France. Stress corrosion cracks were found in pipes in the cooling systems of some reactors. The group’s net debt rose to almost €65bn last year, up from €43bn a year earlier. EDF’s chief executive, Luc Rémont, who was appointed by the French government last November to turn the company around, said: “Today, our priority is to put EDF back on track.” EDF said it invested £2.6bn in the UK in 2022 in its nuclear, renewables and customer businesses. The company said it was investing more than £13bn in the UK between 2023 and 2025, largely in the Hinkley Point scheme. It is also planning to invest about £2bn in its existing nuclear fleet and renewables projects this year. It welcomed the UK government’s decision last November confirming that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk would go ahead, and which will be developed by EDF. The government has taken a 50% stake in the project, which will be the second of a new generation of UK nuclear power reactors, after Hinkley Point C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/09/rupert-murdoch-keir-starmer-labour-party-power-no-10","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T08:00:40Z","webTitle":"Champagne with Rupert Murdoch … Keir Starmer’s Labour is preparing for power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jul/09/rupert-murdoch-keir-starmer-labour-party-power-no-10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jul/09/rupert-murdoch-keir-starmer-labour-party-power-no-10","fields":{"bodyText":"After 13 years of Conservative government it was, in the words of one guest, “an extraordinary, symbolic moment, like a changing of the guard”. Rupert Murdoch was throwing a midsummer party at Spencer House, the palatial residence in St James’s, London, owned by Earl Spencer. Seated on a sofa in the middle of the main room, the 92-year-old media magnate was holding court with carefully chosen individuals of influence – five minutes at a time, strictly one to one. Cabinet ministers, MPs, media executives and others among the great and the good sipped Pol Roger champagne and admired the extravagant floral arrangements, wondering who would be next. As the numbers swelled, one senior News Corp journalist was chatting away to former prime minister Liz Truss when he had to break off suddenly. His duty was to meet a special guest and bring him to Murdoch. A minute or so later, in swept Keir Starmer in an open-necked black shirt, ready for his audience with the most powerful media figure in the world. “You go, don’t you?” was how Tony Blair, in his memoirs, described what to do when, as leader of a Labour opposition, an invitation arrived to meet Murdoch in “the lion’s den”. One News Corp executive in London noted after the latest party that contact between Starmer, Murdoch and his top brass was by no means rare. In fact, Rupert and Keir had already had a “brush-by” at the News Corp CEO Summit earlier the same day. Nor were their discussions always initiated by the Murdoch side. “We can’t keep him [Starmer] away,” said the source. Last Wednesday, Starmer was unable to attend another summer media party of note, put on by the Conservative-supporting Spectator magazine in Westminster. The Labour leader was in Kent preparing to launch a new education policy the next day. Details of that story – Starmer’s plan to smash the “class ceiling” – were leaked that evening to Murdoch’s Times newspaper, which led its front page on Thursday with the headline “Speaking lessons for all pupils”. Courting the right-leaning media influencers was working a treat. Despite Starmer’s absence, his team was well represented at the Spectator do, with several of his closest aides in attendance. Shadow cabinet members Wes Streeting and Jonathan Ashworth were also there, lapping up the attention. “People wanted to talk more to the Labour people than the Conservatives,” said one member of team Starmer after the event. “That tells you a lot.” Another senior MP who attended noted that nothing better illustrated how far Labour had come since the days of Jeremy Corbyn than his party’s heavy presence on such summer evenings where the champagne flows. With his party far ahead in the opinion polls (15 points in today’s Opinium survey for the Observer, more in several others) Starmer and his people no longer have to try to generate media or corporate interest. Their challenge is to manage and control it as it grows, and maximise the opportunities it throws up. For Starmer, the demands on his time are growing every day as a general election approaches, and as the Tories divide and disintegrate as a fighting force. “You can feel it now,” said a shadow cabinet member. “The media is preparing psychologically for a Labour government. Business is preparing for one, too. The Tories are preparing for defeat. Their focus now is on who comes next [after Sunak]. They are circling like sharks around him.” If networking right across the political spectrum is part of the process of preparing for power, so too is maintaining discipline and keeping feet on the ground. There is a nervousness at the top of Labour now that is mounting in parallel with rising expectations. Over recent weeks, Starmer’s campaigns director, Morgan McSweeney, has been acting as “killjoy in chief”, studying political campaigns run by parties which were way ahead in the polls in the run-up to polling day, and were expected to win, then bombed and lost. He has been passing the lesson on to everyone who matters at the top of the party, above all about the need to assume nothing and take nothing for granted – and to stay in touch with voters’ interests. “People have been in our position before and lost, and we need to know why that is,” he says. McSweeney has been debriefing political figures who suffered the pain of three failed left-of-centre campaigns: Labour’s in 1992, when the party under Neil Kinnock was defeated by the Tories led by John Major (the infamous Sheffield rally being a lesson on its own); the Democrats under Hillary Clinton in 2016, who lost to Donald Trump’s Republicans; and the Australian Labor party’s defeat under Bill Shorten in 2019, when the minority Liberal-National Coalition government, led by prime minister Scott Morrison, secured a third term. McSweeney points out Labour lost a seat last week to the Conservatives on Cambridge city council for the first time in years. This can be put down almost entirely to the Labour-run administration’s unpopular plans for a congestion charge in the city. One error can knock an entire campaign off course: that is the lesson from Cambridge. On the practical planning front, young Labour advisers are now being given regular “preparation for government” advice sessions by staff who worked for ministers such as Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson in the New Labour administration. “There is a lot about how government works, what to expect,” said one Labour staffer. This work will be stepped up when former civil servant Sue Gray takes up her post as Starmer’s chief of staff in the autumn. Another Labour adviser said it was difficult at times to think ahead because of conflicting messages. “We are told so often to guard against complacency. Every week its about how we are not measuring the curtains [inside No 10]. You are told one minute to prepare, the next to assume nothing. It can be a bit disorientating.” While the Tories tear each other apart, discipline levels inside the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) are rising. Most people on the Corbynite left have long since departed or are now eyeing opportunities that could be in store if they stay quiet. “There are lots of ostensibly ‘left’ members of the PLP who actually quite fancy being government ministers,” said one senior figure. “The prospect of winning v losing is what sharpens minds.” Another Labour staffer said the prize was too great for anyone with “half an ounce of sense” to rock the boat: “We have [not] been in as good a position as we are now for ages. That is partly because of the desperate state the Tories are in and partly because of good decisions by Keir. The fact of the matter is that, at this stage, no one wants to be the one who fucks this up.” If there is a nagging doubt in Labour ranks, however – and it still exists among plenty at the top of the party – it is that the Starmer bandwagon may be something of an illusion, powered more by Tory failures and infighting than by any real vision that he or Labour has so far been able to offer in policy terms. The party finds itself in the tricky position of having to prepare a policy programme that appeals widely, and that addresses the decay in public services after 13 years of Tory rule, when the economy is hardly growing and inflation and interest rates are both stubbornly high. “The fact is there is no money,” says a shadow cabinet member. “We have to deal with that, and make it the Tories’ fault – not set traps for ourselves as a result of their failures.” There is also a defensiveness at the heart of much Labour strategy – most notable in its reluctance to talk about the failings of Brexit – that infuriates and depresses some of the party’s MPs. For the few Tories who still have any hope that their party can win the next election, it lies in a feeling that Starmer will come across as vacuous and without vision when voters finally have to make their choice. One former Tory cabinet member told the Observer: “Obviously, it should be Labour’s to lose now, but I still wonder how they deal with this central issue of what Starmer is about. He seems to lack a purpose, and that will look worse when there is no money.” In recent weeks, with the economy so sluggish, Starmer and his shadow ministers have already had to rein back on expectations about how much they would be able to spend in government, and when – even on their core projects such as green investment. “I am increasingly alarmed by the state of the economy,” said a senior shadow cabinet member. “This means we are having to be serious and honest with people and say we will have to rule out or delay things. It is a difficult message.” For some, all this is unsettling. “There’s obviously been a process of tightening up and a whole set of policies, and so people just feel constrained,” said one influential figure on Labour’s left. “At the moment, it has a weird effect. Keir does these speeches about his five missions. He’s then asked questions at the speeches about things that he’s not going to do – so the message coming out of them is often what Labour is ruling out. Maybe that’s what they want.” In reality, Labour’s high command is indeed open about cutting back on any aspects of a policy programme that might be attacked by the Tories as unaffordable, and therefore irresponsible, in the run-up to an election. They believe the positives to be gained from being seen as responsible – particularly after the years of ill-discipline and chaos under Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss – outweigh the negatives of being accused of lack of ambition. “We are trying to make sure the manifesto is as tight as possible,” one senior figure said. “It means that lots of the things the Tories will try and claim we are going to spend on, with the inevitable spending dossier, simply won’t be part of our policy platform.” Shadow ministers are told week after week that there is no money by the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden. They are having to go away and come up with cost-free ideas because fiscal responsibility is the watchword. This week, shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth will make a speech in which he will unveil plans to use artificial intelligence in the welfare system to increase efficiency and save public money at the same time. As the summer break approaches, and Labour figures turn their minds to conference season in the autumn, they hope the public and the media – including outlets run by Murdoch – will buy the message. “The public wants change,” says a shadow cabinet member. “But it also wants responsibility. That is the tightrope we are walking. It is not easy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/aug/21/whitney-museum-new-york-trust-me-exhibit","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-21T17:04:21Z","webTitle":"‘We’re craving intimacy’: how art can show the power and limitations of trust","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/21/whitney-museum-new-york-trust-me-exhibit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/21/whitney-museum-new-york-trust-me-exhibit","fields":{"bodyText":"Vulnerability, intimacy, and most of all trust are essential – albeit fraught – parts of our most important relationships. They can bring about the kind of connections that make life rich and meaningful, and they are what allow human beings to truly support one another, but they are also extremely complicated and often challenging to navigate. Through an intergenerational and diverse group of 11 artists, the Whitney’s new exhibit, Trust Me, offers audiences a chance to examine these concepts and their many different sides. “Something that I hope people will come into the show and hold onto is the idea that trust is not always rewarded,” said Kelly Long, exhibition organizer and senior curatorial assistant at the Whitney. “This is a show about trust and also its failure. Who is the speaker? Who is asking for trust? Who is ordering trust? These are the questions that I hope people will take forward.” Trust Me does an impressive job of showing audiences the true diversity and range of the photographic medium. Pieces here range from an intimate moment between friends captured by Genesis Báez to the innovative, cross-color processing of Lola Flash to the intricately layered photographs of Muriel Hasbun to the pioneering self-portraiture of Laura Aguilar. Long shared that she was eager to bring to this exhibit a new crop of photographic talent – a big part her purpose was embodying the trust at its center by building just that with a new cohort of artists. “I’m a young curator entering into relationships with these artists,” Long said, “many of whom are also emerging in one way or another. Being able to find our way together, to offer support to one another and build something with each other – trust is so essential for that, and it’s something I’ve been trying out and figuring out in this exhibition. So it’s been very much a part of the process, and I’ve thought about ways to make that process really joyful and supportive.” Juxtaposing the work of younger photographers, like Báez and Navajo artist Dakota Mace, with that of more established photographers, like Aguilar, offers a pleasing sense of freshness and serendipity to the exhibition. “I was excited to let poetry drive this exhibit,” Long said. “I wanted to let artists that you haven’t seen on a wall together before speak to each other.” Three works by the celebrated Chicana artist Laura Aguilar bring gravity to Trust Me. One shows the artist spread out amid a landscape, her body almost merging into the rocks on which she lies, while the other two strike a much more political stance: in 1993’s Will Work For #4, the photographer holds a sign reading “Will Work for Axcess,” while in Plush Pony #2 she adopts a powerfully assertive, confrontational stance while wearing a white, A-line tank. Rhyming with Aguilar’s works are two works from Jenny Calivas’s more recent series, Self-Portraits While Buried. In these, the presence of the artist is all-but effaced beneath murky waters and thick muds – Calivas seemingly adds her own voice to Aguilar’s themes of womanhood, erasure, and self-creation. Long shared with me that the friendship between Calivas and Báez, who studied together at Yale, was, for her a largely hidden aspect of the show that added to its poetry and magic. “This is one of the really beautiful relationships in the show, whether or not audiences happen to know about it. We don’t have a label that says that these two artists are dear friends, but there they are, side by side, and that is something that I really treasure.” Báez, whose art centers Puerto Rican women, offers three prints for the show, among them the delicate The Sound of a Circle. A deceptively simple shot of a girl whispering into another girl’s ear, it was the fruit of a lengthy and protracted struggle. “The Sound of a Circle is a very special work to me,” said Long. “Genesis usually carefully composes her photos, but this is an image where chance has really gotten in and contributed to that magic. Báez spent all day trying to make a photograph of a whisper, but not succeeding. She finally decided to take a break and went out to lunch with her subjects. Suddenly the sunlight just poured in, Genesis shoved all the plates aside, and she made this stunning, arresting, perfect image.” Báez also contributes Crossing Time, an enigmatic photo whose subject seems to hold a string up to her own shadow, and and Parting (Braid), another enigmatic and ethereal shot of a woman braiding another woman’s hair. These snaps offer intimacy in the more classic sense, bringing alive our five senses in an uncommonly powerful way. It’s this sensuality and embodiment that Long is eager to explore in Trust Me. “I think it’s no surprise that we’re craving intimacy after being separated from each other for so long,” she said. “There seems to be a particular urgency – maybe it’s curatorial urgency, or audience-driven urgency, as much as it is urgency that the artist themselves are expressing. It’s what we’ve all just lived through and are continuing to live through, finding each other and making meaning in this confusing world we’re inhabiting. It’s a different world, and I think people are entering museums in a slightly different way and looking for something slightly different.” According to Long, the choice to make the show entirely of photographs added dimensions of her exploration of trust and intimacy. “There’s something very immediate about photography. Offers something very particular when thinking through intimacy. We all have a relationship with photography. There’s something very familiar and very easy about engaging with images of this kind, even when the content of these images may not be easy at all.” Long also shared that she sees potential in photography to address deep ethical questions about art and to examine notions of redress for historical wrongs. That makes her excited to share Trust Me with the public and, hopefully, build trust. “Any time you make a picture of someone or something, you’re entering into an ethical contract,” she said. “Photography has a really violent history of being used to categorize people - marginalized people - to really do violence. The artists here are working in ways that are recuperative, restorative, to offer new visions of reciprocity and build capacity. I think that’s an incredibly beautiful thing and a really beautiful moment for photography.” Trust Me is now on view at the Whitney museum in New York until February 2024"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/24/new-windfarm-could-be-used-to-power-north-sea-oilfield","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-24T14:00:09Z","webTitle":"New windfarm could be used to power North Sea oilfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/24/new-windfarm-could-be-used-to-power-north-sea-oilfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/24/new-windfarm-could-be-used-to-power-north-sea-oilfield","fields":{"bodyText":"Electricity from a new onshore windfarm could be used to power the biggest undeveloped oilfield in the North Sea, campaigners are warning, ahead of an imminent decision over whether to approve the project. The huge Rosebank oilfield is three times bigger than the controversial Cambo field that was put on hold more than a year ago. It has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil and its final approval is expected to reach the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in the next few weeks. It is expected to be approved after Rishi Sunak hinted last month that it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in UK oil and gas because Britain will remain reliant on fossil fuels for “the next few decades”. Reducing its potential emissions will play a major part in the approval process for Rosebank, with its main backer vowing to develop the “lowest possible carbon footprint” for the project. The environmental statement drawn up by the project’s backers suggests that they are exploring the option of sourcing clean energy from a forthcoming onshore windfarm in nearby Shetland. “Electrification connected to the electrical grid on Shetland has the greatest potential for [greenhouse gas] reduction with the proposed windfarms on Shetland providing a low carbon source of energy via cable,” it states. The Rosebank field is being developed by the Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which is now under pressure from campaigners not to monopolise the energy produced by Shetland’s new 103-turbine Viking windfarm, which is being completed. “Rosebank is oil for export and will do nothing to boost the UK’s energy security,” said Tessa Khan, executive director of the campaigning group Uplift. “If it also ends up taking vast amounts of cheap, clean energy that could be used to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, it will end up actively reducing the UK’s energy security. This would be laughable if it wasn’t so serious. The project has already faced claims that without such electrification plans, the oilfield will blow a hole in the UK’s carbon budgets that should come from oil and gas production, from 2028 onwards. In response, Equinor pointed to a statement from earlier in the year by the oil and gas regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority, in which it stated: “New oil and gas fields in the North Sea can absolutely be in keeping with the UK’s commitment to net zero.” The conflict exposes the controversies that are being created as fossil fuel producers attempt to alter their plans in order to reduce their emissions. Rosebank is just one of several projects that are exploring the use of renewable power for their fossil fuel extraction operations. Last year, a group of North Sea operators met energy minister Graham Stuart and agreed to look at electrification. Three new oilfields – Clair South, Rosebank and Cambo – are exploring options for electrification. Analysts from Uplift found that the three would require up to 200-250MW of electricity to power their rigs, equating to at least three-quarters of the energy produced by the Viking windfarm – enough energy to power more than 450,000 UK homes. “We know that without electrification, Rosebank will bust the industry’s already weak climate targets,” said Khan. “Shetlanders and the UK public at large need to know that this option for decarbonising Rosebank is off the table, before and not after any decision is made on Rosebank. There must be no nasty surprises from Equinor.” A spokesperson for Equinor said that the project had “the potential to strengthen energy security with oil and gas that is produced with a much lower carbon footprint than current UK production”. “The field will have a low carbon footprint compared with the current UK Continental Shelf average already before electrification. With electrification, it will be even lower. “The electrification schedule is driven by the confirmation of the power source, grid connections and necessary offshore and onshore consenting,” said Equinor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/13/uk-innovators-get-43m-to-develop-space-based-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"UK innovators get £4.3m to develop space-based solar power ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/uk-innovators-get-43m-to-develop-space-based-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/13/uk-innovators-get-43m-to-develop-space-based-solar-power","fields":{"bodyText":"UK universities and tech companies are to receive £4.3m in government funding to develop space-based solar power. The technology, which collects energy from the sun using satellite-mounted panels and beams it to Earth, had huge potential to boost the UK’s energy security, the UK’s energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said. Although the idea of building commercial power stations in space may sound far-fetched, the space industry has long been at the forefront of solar power development. Indeed, the need to power satellites was a key driver in increasing the efficiency of solar panels that generate electricity for homes and businesses, said Dr Mamatha Maheshwarappa, the payload systems lead at the UK Space Agency. Among the recipients of the funding from the government’s space-based solar power innovation competition are Cambridge University, which is developing ultra-lightweight solar panels that can withstand the high radiation levels encountered in space, and Queen Mary University of London, which is developing a wireless system to allow space-harvested solar power to be safely beamed to Earth. This month, scientists at the California Institute of Technology in the US claimed to have successfully transmitted solar power to Earth from space for the first time, using a prototype spacecraft called Maple that was launched into orbit in January. It uses an array of flexible lightweight transmitters to convert electricity into microwaves before beaming them to a specific location on Earth – in this case, a receiver on the roof of a building on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena – where they are converted back into electrical energy. Assuming that the technology can be made to work on a large scale, there would be some significant advantages to space-based solar farms. Because there is no atmosphere in space, the sun’s light is undiluted, meaning each panel would be able to generate more energy compared with an equivalent panel on Earth. The solar energy would also be more predictable and continuous due to the absence of day-night cycles, cloud cover and seasonal variations in sunlight. A UK government-commissioned independent study in 2021 found that space-based solar power could generate up to 10GW capacity a year by 2050, a quarter of the UK’s current electricity demand. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has claimed it could create a multibillion-pound industry and up to 143,000 jobs across the country. Announcing the funding at London Tech Week, Shapps said: “We’re taking a giant leap by backing the development of this exciting technology and putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly emerging industry as it prepares for launch. By winning this new space race, we can transform the way we power our nation and provide cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for generations to come.” Other projects to be awarded funding are: Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd in Didcot, for an experiment to test the electronic steering and beam quality of its space satellite antenna technology; MicroLink Devices UK Ltd in Port Talbot, to develop the next generation of lightweight, flexible solar panels; and the University of Bristol, to produce a simulation of solar space wireless power transfer capability and provide further evidence on the performance, safety and reliability of space-based solar. Imperial College London and EDF Energy will also receive funding for studies to assess how electricity from space-based power stations could be integrated into the electricity grid alongside other low-carbon energy sources. • This article was amended on 13 June 2023. Due to an error in the information provided by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, an earlier version said that space-based solar power could generate up to 10GW of electricity a year by 2050, a quarter of the UK’s power needs; rather than 10GW capacity, a quarter of the UK’s current electricity demand by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/18/us-teens-banned-books-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘Knowledge is power’: new app helps US teens read books banned in school","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/18/us-teens-banned-books-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/18/us-teens-banned-books-schools","fields":{"bodyText":"Maia Kobabe’s 2019 memoir Gender Queer is an after-dinner favorite in Jen Cousins’ house. The family lives in Orange county, Florida, and all four children read the book when their mother first brought it home two years ago. She had to; she couldn’t stop crying when she read the last page. For Saffy, her second oldest, who is now 14, Kobabe’s memoir is more than an after-school read. It has become a lifeline. Saffy came out as non-binary two years ago and finished the book in just an afternoon. Looking up at their mom, they said they finally felt seen. The changes in her child, Jen described, were palpable. Small forms of expression, once so painstaking – like what to wear into sixth grade – become exciting decisions pulled off with effortless ease. One day it was a pink dress patterned with strawberries: another, a two-piece suit and tie. At home, the book helped Saffy feel comfortable and confident with gender expression. But at school, Gender Queer was banned. For the past two years, book banning has been on the rise in schools and libraries across the US, mainly due to far-right pressure. The bans are pushed either by local actors, like anxious parents and parent-led groups or by politicians through broader state-level laws. A recent PEN America study found that the bans were most prevalent this year in Florida, Texas, Utah, Missouri and South Carolina. Consistently, these bans target materials written by and about people of color or LGBTQ+ individuals, and even though a 2022 poll found that 70% of parents oppose them, they are continuing at a rapid rate. Now the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is trying to fight back. It recently launched the Banned Book Program, granting free nationwide access to books restricted in schools or libraries. It functions through GPS-based geo-targeting; by typing in your zip code, you are shown the complete list of titles prohibited in your area. Once you download the Palace e-reader app, these books are available to download. “Saying ‘Just to go to the library’ is no longer a stable alternative to having these books in schools,” Jen said. “Some kids don’t have supportive parents or live near public transport. The DPLA has created a resource that will benefit so many.” “These books aren’t just for kids who are queer,” Jen added, “they’re as much for those who aren’t, to teach them empathy. It’s insidious that the state is telling children who they should or shouldn’t be.” The nationwide fight over what is appropriate for children to read is happening in tandem with a broader legislative push to restrict the teaching of topics such as racism and sexuality in schools. Bills like “Don’t say gay”, which rightwing governor Ron DeSantis signed into effect in Florida last year, scaled back what could be taught in the state’s curriculums. Alabama and Arkansas have since enacted similar laws, undermining the resources that children can use to think, read and learn. Even for Steven Roiphe, a father living near Bar Harbor in coastal Maine – an area with fewer restrictions – these bans feel like they’re closing in on his family. Steven’s son Lincoln is 10 years old and about to start the fifth grade. He loves podcasts, audiobooks and recently just finished Property of the Rebel Librarian. If the family’s nearest public library doesn’t have a book, though, it can be challenging to get; they don’t have a bookstore in their local town, and the closest one by car has a limited selection. “I told my son, any books he needs that are restricted, I’ll download the Banned Book app,” Steven said. “People are coming to blows even at small school-board meetings like ours, so it’s great to have this e-library at our fingertips.” The DPLA’s Banned Book Program is not the first online resource of its kind in the US. In April 2022, the Brooklyn Public Library in New York launched Books Unbanned, giving anyone between the ages of 13 and 21 a free library card to download ebooks from their collection. The venture was successful; over 6,000 teens from all 50 states signed up, checking out roughly 100,000 online books. Seattle Public Library followed suit earlier this year, vowing to “stand with Brooklyn” and “fight censorship” by replicating their scheme. Having a west coast operation, they believed, might extend the reach of audiences, also helping those in rural areas with less access to resources. “Every individual has the right to decide what materials they choose to read and to explore new viewpoints,” said Andrew Harbison, the Seattle Public Library’s director of library programs and services. For Nicole Miltonberger, a high school student in Austin, Texas, resources like this could be crucial to her and her friends going into the future. Nicole is a founder of the Vandegrift Banned Book Club, an all-female group that meets after school to discuss a different banned book. A recent favorite was Nowhere Girls, Amy Reed’s 2017 novel that fights against the pervasiveness of rape culture and school misogyny. Every week, the students gather around the wooden-lined library and pick a new title banned in their state. They have a range of choices, too; Texas districts had the most instances of book bans last year, totalling 438. It’s a routine these girls love, that they feel empowers them and, most importantly, helps them fight back. “Knowledge is power,” Nicole said. For Jen and her family, it’s a different story. Their situation in Florida, especially with queer children, has become unimaginable. “If I had the money, I would absolutely relocate us to another state in a heartbeat,” she said. “We don’t have the financial stability to do that now, but it is part of our five-year plan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/sep/01/consultancy-firm-used-power-maps-of-australian-officials-to-help-win-government-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-31T15:00:09Z","webTitle":"Consultancy firm used ‘power maps’ of Australian officials to help win government contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/01/consultancy-firm-used-power-maps-of-australian-officials-to-help-win-government-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/sep/01/consultancy-firm-used-power-maps-of-australian-officials-to-help-win-government-contracts","fields":{"bodyText":"A consultancy firm that secured $528m of taxpayer money last year has admitted to maintaining hundreds of “power maps” that categorise federal officials based on influence, personality type and relationships with competitors. Accenture has told the Senate the maps are restricted and only supplied to staff on a “need to know” basis, but acknowledged they were used in the process of bidding for government work. The power maps detail whether officials are “analytical”, “expressive” or “a driver”. They identify key decision-makers and who has the most influence within teams, and rank how favourably officials may view Accenture. The power maps also monitor internal conflicts within departments and any negative relationships between colleagues. They monitor which public servants may have relationships with rival consultancy firms and how strong those connections are. Accenture’s market lead for Australia and New Zealand, Peter Burns, detailed the power maps to a parliamentary inquiry into consultants. This was in a response to questions from Labor senator Deborah O’Neill, who is a member of the committee conducting the inquiry. “Within Accenture, access to power maps is restricted and can only be accessed by individuals on a need-to-know basis,” Burns said in documents published by the Senate. “Power maps are used as part of a tendering process to determine how we may assist a client to effect change within their organisation, particularly in relation to understanding the outcomes the client is seeking to achieve and ensuring we can provide appropriate solutions.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But O’Neill told Guardian Australia that “the practice of ‘power mapping’ departmental officials represents an overt attempt by consulting companies to inappropriately influence the public service”. Accenture is not considered one of the big four consultancy firms but is favoured by the federal government. Last financial year its contracts with the public service were worth $528m, which is more than that of KPMG, Deloitte and PwC, and double what EY was paid. The big four firms told the Senate inquiry that they did not engage in any form of power mapping, although those assurances will be scrutinised at upcoming inquiry hearings. “PwC Australia does not engage in the practice of ‘power mapping’ or maintain records that characterise public servants by influence, relationships to one another or attitude towards consultancies,” said Jan McCahey, PwC’s chief risk and ethics leader. O’Neill told Guardian Australia she would seek more information and “push for fulsome and honest responses to the questions which I have put to these firms”. Accenture was unable to say how many power maps had been maintained, but estimated “hundreds have been created in relation to government opportunities from 2015 onwards”. “Whenever we participate in a tendering process, we strictly abide by the probity rules, which includes not contacting or participating in any discussions or meetings with any individuals [including any that may be included on a power map] who are part of the decision-making process for that tender,” Burns told the inquiry. “Power maps are one element in our assessment of potential client projects and are used on most of our client engagements, including with our public service clients, and as part of our account planning processes.” During a Senate inquiry hearing in July, Burns said Accenture had not changed its internal processes as a result of the reputation crisis that engulfed PwC Australia and led to its government services division being divested for just $1. “I would be misleading the committee if we said we specifically did something different as a consequence of [the PwC scandal],” Burns told the inquiry."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/aug/25/boxing-daniel-duboiss-power-his-sole-hope-of-upsetting-oleksandr-usyk","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-25T14:01:14Z","webTitle":"Dubois pins hopes on power but ring wizard Usyk should prevent an upset","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/25/boxing-daniel-duboiss-power-his-sole-hope-of-upsetting-oleksandr-usyk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/aug/25/boxing-daniel-duboiss-power-his-sole-hope-of-upsetting-oleksandr-usyk","fields":{"bodyText":"Daniel Dubois has had 20 fights as a professional heavyweight while Oleksandr Usyk has had only four bouts in the same division. Usyk is much the smaller man, usually weighing 20 pounds less than Dubois who, at 6ft 5in, is two inches taller than him. Dubois is 25 and he clearly punches harder than the 36-year-old Usyk who is also living though the trauma of his country, Ukraine, being ground down by a Russian invasion that is no closer to being resolved now than when it began 18 months ago. Yet the blunt truth remains that none of Dubois’s considerable advantages are likely to count for much when he steps into the ring in the Polish city of Wroclaw on Saturday night to challenge Usyk who will make the second defence of the IBF, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles he won when he outclassed Anthony Joshua in September 2021. Usyk, unlike Dubois, is a brilliant technician and a hardened champion who has a deep and outstanding pedigree as both an amateur and professional boxer. An Olympic gold medallist and the former undisputed cruiserweight champion of the world, Usyk displays an ease and wizardry between the ropes that Dubois will never be able to master. It was no real surprise to those who have followed him for years that Usyk was just too skilful and courageous for Joshua in both of their fights, despite the rematch last August being only his fourth as a heavyweight. And so it is hard to make a compelling case for Dubois who has not faced the same quality of opposition as Joshua had done before he lost to the Ukrainian grandmaster. Dubois was brave and locked in battle with Joe Joyce when a fractured orbital bone brought a premature end to their contest in November 2020. He has rebuilt his career from that shattering defeat but Dubois was knocked down three times in the first round in his last bout against the deeply obscure South African Kevin Lerena. There was clear mitigation that Dubois took a heavy blow to the temple just after his leg buckled painfully beneath him. He showed great courage to drag himself off the canvas and then knock out Lerena with devastating power in the third round. That power offers Dubois’s sole hope of causing an upset against Usyk. He and his new trainer, Don Charles, know that he cannot attempt to outpoint the champion so Dubois has promised to be aggressive in his pursuit of an early stoppage. Criticising Joshua for being excessively cautious in his approach, Dubois said of Usyk earlier this week: “You’ve definitely got to rough him up. It’s no secret – you can’t stand there and try and outbox him. I know what I’ve got to do.” Heavyweight boxing, of course, is different because it is the realm of bizarre and unexpected events where one huge punch from a giant man can change everything. But Usyk has almost certainly seen too much, both in and out of the ring, to be unsettled by Dubois. With the vast majority of the 40,000 crowd roaring their support for him in Wroclaw, only 300 miles from the Ukrainian border, Usyk will be concentrated and determined. Wroclow has always had a large Ukrainian population, which has increased markedly since refugees began flooding across the border, and Usyk spoke recently of the war in his battered homeland. “After my fights with Anthony Joshua I went to the frontline. I lived with the soldiers. Of course that gave me motivation. I sometimes speak to my friends on the phone, and I can hear missiles exploding in the background. I can hear the sounds of bombing. The people I speak to say ‘brother, I will call you back, if I am still alive.’” Usyk added that: “Through binoculars, from 900m, I saw my enemies running, exploding tanks and broken houses. I saw people with no legs and arms. I saw people walking but looking like they were dead.” The world champion is a heroic figure in Ukraine, with his fights offering fleeting respite from the war. “If I can bring people just a little bit of enjoyment,” he said, “I would fight every day.” That commitment from Usyk means that it is likely to be a long and difficult night for the British challenger. Dubois seems to believe he will produce a seismic shock but all the odds, apart from his physical attributes, are stacked against him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/20/note-to-labour-energy-transition-isnt-just-about-power-generation","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-19T23:00:25Z","webTitle":"Note to Labour: energy transition isn’t just about power generation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/20/note-to-labour-energy-transition-isnt-just-about-power-generation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/jun/20/note-to-labour-energy-transition-isnt-just-about-power-generation","fields":{"bodyText":"A Labour government would establish a new publicly-owned energy generation company in Scotland, Keir Starmer announced on Monday. Fine, if expertise and jobs from the North Sea industry are to be transferred over time, Scotland is a logical place to put it. But the location is only a minor piece of the decision-making. Two more important questions about “Great British Energy” are these: how much money will it have to invest? And which investments would it prioritise? There is – as yet – no hint of an answer to the first question, perhaps understandably if a general election is still more than a year away. But note that many outsiders think GBE would need an annual investment budget of £5bn-£10bn to make a meaningful difference to the pace of energy transition. Clarity can’t wait for ever. But we are – at last – getting more detail on what the company would do. It would, for example, back a “local power plan” to build clean energy projects at a community level. Since there are numerous examples from Europe of successful municipal networks – from Germany and Norway – that seems uncontentious. Other examples where GBE would look to invest are described as emerging technologies, from green hydrogen, floating offshore wind to tidal and so on. And, thankfully, Labour does not imagine that GBE would be a go-it-alone investor. It is talking the language of public-private partnerships and using public money as a way to de-risk projects. That all sounds commendable and pragmatic. Yet, even among supporters of a new publicly-backed enterprise, there are doubts about whether GBE has got its emphasis in the correct place. Labour talks almost exclusively about the new company being a generator of power. But is generation really the top priority? The far trickier bit in energy transition – and the part where the UK is off the pace internationally – is decarbonising the industrial base. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, will speak on Tuesday at King’s College London and one hopes he has digested the friendly thoughts of Nick Butler, the college’s visiting professor and energy economist. There is “a serious role” for a publicly-owned enterprise, agrees Butler’s 43-page report (also out on Tuesday), but transition is not all about generation capacity. Here’s a key line from Butler’s report: “Much of the debate on energy policy focuses on extending the base of supply, but increased volume of low-carbon energy from wind or solar will only make a difference if consumers can use the energy produced as a substitute for their existing use of hydrocarbons.” Exactly. There is no shortage of capital willing to invest in new offshore wind projects (even if one wishes more windfarms in UK waters were UK-owned). And, if a Labour government loosens the planning rules for onshore wind, as Starmer says it would, there would probably be a queue of investors there too. So, if one were prioritising targets for state intervention in the energy system, big generation projects might be near the bottom. “The full potential of wind power … will only be delivered if there are significant advances in the use of electricity in areas such as heating, transport and industry – the sectors which account for the majority of current energy demand,” says the report. Butler has a long list of ideas of priority investment, all of which could be grouped as demand, rather than supply, challenges: ensure the grid can handle large volumes of renewable power and be compatible with two-way transfers from electric vehicles; develop storage capacity to ensure renewable power is not wasted at times of excess supply; complete electrification of the railways, which should have happened years ago; develop a hydrogen network; and support development of a North Sea energy grid with other countries to mitigate challenges of intermittency. Every item on that wishlist sounds fertile territory for a state-backed company – big stuff that requires heavy lifting and long-term backing. Decarbonising industry, note, is also where the bulk of subsidies under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act are being directed. Labour isn’t blind to the wider challenges, of course. Monday’s document on the plan to make Britain “a cleaner energy superpower” also recognised the need to upgrade the electricity transmission infrastructure and expand the grid’s capacity. But accelerating rail electrification, for instance, wasn’t mentioned. It’s early days, but one wishes Labour’s vision for GBE was wider than clean energy generation. If the job of the company is to fill gaps in the national decarbonisation programme, there are some yawning holes that aren’t being talked about enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/18/first-thing-japan-pm-push-nuclear-weapons-pledge-hiroshima","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T09:59:34Z","webTitle":"Japan PM prepares push for nuclear weapons pledge in Hiroshima  | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/18/first-thing-japan-pm-push-nuclear-weapons-pledge-hiroshima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/18/first-thing-japan-pm-push-nuclear-weapons-pledge-hiroshima","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. The war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan will dominate G7 discussions this week, but the host, Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, is expected to carve out time to push for a pledge on nuclear weapons when leaders meet in Hiroshima, the first place on Earth targeted by an atomic bomb. The leaders began to arrive on Thursday, before an expected visit on Saturday to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, which contains exhibits showing the scale of the tragedy that unfolded after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people by the end of the year. Kishida, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other G7 leaders are expected to see displays including a simulation that reproduces the wave of destruction that followed the bombing, with the human cost represented by mundane items such as ripped school uniforms, the blackened contents of a bento lunchbox, and a tricycle whose three-year-old owner would die within 24 hours. The need to reference the dangers of nuclear weapons has intensified since Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima in 2016. Vladimir Putin has refused to publicly rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, while North Korea continues to develop more sophisticated missiles theoretically capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US mainland. What has Kishida said in the run-up to the summit? He spoke of his desire for “a world without nuclear weapons”, although campaigners point to the failure by Japan – part of the US nuclear umbrella – to sign a 2021 UN treaty banning the possession and use of nuclear weapons. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said of the planned group visit to the peace museum. Biden ‘confident’ of reaching deal with McCarthy to avoid US debt default Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said yesterday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach. Speaking at the White House, Biden said: “I’m confident that we’ll get the agreement on the budget, that America will not default. We’re going to come together because there’s no alternative way to do the right thing for the country. We have to move on.” On Tuesday, Biden and McCarthy met for an hour at the White House, a meeting the president called productive. Biden, who has faced some criticism for his handling of the issue, is due to travel to the G7 summit in Japan but has cut the trip short to pursue a debt ceiling deal. Plans to visit Papua New Guinea and Australia were postponed. A failure to honour US debts could have catastrophic effects on the US and world economies. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has indicated that without agreement default could come as early as 1 June. Republicans want sharp spending cuts. Democrats say Republicans should agree to a “clean” debt bill, the sort they repeatedly passed under Donald Trump. But Biden also seemed ready to make compromises, including some work requirements on federal programs, though not on healthcare. What has Biden said in response to the criticism? The president said: “I’ll be in constant contact with my team while I’m at the G7 and be in close touch with speaker McCarthy and other leaders as well. What I have done in anticipation that we won’t get it all done till I get back is, I’ve cut my trip short in order to be [here] for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the majority leader.” What has McCarthy said? Speaking to CNBC, he said: “I think at the end of the day we do not have a debt default. The thing I’m confident about is now we have a structure to find a way to come to a conclusion. The timeline is very tight. But we’re going to make sure we’re in the room and get this done.” Nike may have misclassified workers and could face more than $530m in tax fines Nike may have misclassified thousands of temporary office workers and faces potential tax fines of more than $530m, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. The sporting goods company employs more than 79,000 people worldwide and, like many large corporations, relies on an army of independent contractors to do much of the work, including business consulting, T-shirt graphics, photography and event planning. According to independent reports compiled for the company and given to the Guardian, Nike management’s handling of independent contractors has left it open to potentially huge fines from tax authorities and the possibility of class-action lawsuits. The US, UK and other countries have strict rules about the use of independent contractors, meant to protect workers’ rights and ensure fair tax collection. The Biden administration last year indicated it intends to crack down on companies that infringe them. Where does the $530m figure come from? A July 2022 review of Nike’s independent contractors in the US, UK, the Netherlands and Belgium concluded the company faces a “misclassification risk” of more than $530m. The report, compiled by People2.0, a workforce services specialist, looked at 3,670 entities – independent contractors, law firms, individuals and others – in the US who had been paid more than $7.2bn over three years. It found that a quarter of those contractors may have been incorrectly classified. What has Nike said? The company did not return calls and emails for comment. In other news … Jack Teixeira, the US air national guard member charged with being behind the Pentagon leaks of highly classified military documents, was warned repeatedly over his mishandling of classified material, according to a court filing. Justice department lawyers made the disclosure in court papers that urged Teixeira be kept behind bars while he awaits trial.

Montana has became the first US state to ban TikTok after the governor signed legislation prohibiting mobile application stores from offering the app within the state by next year. The move is among the most dramatic in a series of US escalations against TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. Stat of the day: top five US executives hoard $9bn tax-free for retirement as workers face limits The top five executives at the US’s largest companies have amassed close to $9bn in tax-free retirement saving accounts while many of their employees have struggled to set aside any funds for retirement, according to a report released today. The report, A Tale of Two Retirements, from the Institute for Policy Studies and Jobs With Justice, found the top five executives at S&amp;P 500 firms held a combined $8.9bn in special tax-deferred accounts at the end of 2021. Income taxes will be due on this compensation when they withdraw the funds, but in the meantime they benefit from the tax-free compounding of investment returns. These “top hat” plans allow unlimited tax-deferred retirement while ordinary workers face strict limits on their 401(k) retirement plan contributions.

Maybe so, but new parents in Iceland are holding out for better In a bright, bunting-filled community hall in central Reykjavik, 30 parents are attending a council-funded playgroup. Half of them are fathers – not unusual in a country considered to have one of the best childcare policies in the world. As well as six months’ leave for both parents at 80% of pay – with six weeks extra to share between them – childcare is heavily subsidised by the government. Yet parents and policymakers are pushing for more. Iceland spends 1.7% of its gross domestic product on early childhood education and care – more than double that of most other countries. That leaves Icelandic families spending only about 5% of their income on childcare. Despite this, parents at the Thursday playgroup, run by an organisation called Memmm, are pushing for more change. Parents explain why. … or this: the fall of Rudy Giuliani, once the toast of New York, continues unabated From “America’s mayor” to a human punchline, Rudy Giuliani’s descent continues unabated, writes Lloyd Green. On Monday, news broke of the septuagenarian being slammed with a $10m sexual harassment and unpaid wages lawsuit brought by Noelle Dunphy, 43, a former aide. The mighty have fallen. Once Giuliani was the toast of town. As a federal prosecutor he sent a congressman to jail, locked up mobsters and indicted white-collar criminals. As mayor, he made the streets feel safe again. Love him or hate him, crime precipitously dropped on his watch. In the days and months following 9/11, he projected strength, confidence and reassurance. He had braced himself for a calamity; he just didn’t know its source or when it would happen. He was steady when crunch time arrived. These days, Giuliani and the words “defendant” and “buffoon” stand adjacent. Man sues Giuliani over false arrest after ‘pat’ on back led to assault charge Climate check: world likely to breach 1.5C climate threshold by 2027, scientists warn The world is almost certain to experience new record temperatures in the next five years and temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, scientists have warned. The breaching of the crucial 1.5C threshold, which scientists have said could have dire consequences, should be only temporary, according to research from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, it would represent a marked acceleration of human impacts on the global climate system and send the world into “uncharted territory”, the UN agency warned. Countries have pledged, under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, to try to hold global temperatures to no higher than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, after scientific advice that heating beyond that level would unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts. Last Thing: blues singer gets high school diploma decades after being expelled for his hair The US blues musician Otis Taylor, whose critically revered song Ten Million Slaves has been featured on major films and television shows, has at the age of 74 received his diploma from the high school that expelled him decades ago because of his hairstyle. Taylor was studying at Manual high school in Denver in 1966 when he drew unwanted attention from administrators because of his long hair and was kicked out. Since then, laws have been passed that prohibit discrimination against students over their hairstyle. More recently, Denver’s public school district “wanted to right [the] wrong” inflicted on the music star as a teenager, according to a CBS report. Officials invited him to a ceremony this week in which they presented him with an honorary diploma symbolizing the one he would have received if the modern rules were in effect at the time he was a student at Manual.

Except, you could be forgiven for thinking that’s how it has been taken, on the basis of the tripling down by the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in support of its deluded president in the form of an 808-word defence of Rubiales. The extraordinary RFEF statement – which dropped late on Friday night and is headlined “Official Statement of the RFEF in response to Futpro”, the Spanish players’ union – genuinely reads like it is meant to be Rubiales’s “A-ha! Gotcha!” moment. From threatening Futpro and Jenni Hermoso with legal action to insisting it is an “obligation” for all federated players to participate in national team duty should they be called on, it is a lesson in how, to coin a phrase, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Rubiales is being backed. A staggering 81 women have said they will not play for Spain while he is in charge – but who internally has stood with them? Who edited the statement? Who formatted it for the website? Who posted it? Are they driven by fear or loyalty? And where the hell is their red line? Staggeringly, Rubiales has homed in on the quote attributed to Hermoso in the Futpro statement that says: “In no case did I seek to raise the president.” The RFEF then, at the base of its statement, proceeds to dissect four sequential photographs that appear to show Rubiales being lifted by Hermoso. Except they tell us nothing, nothing of the player’s intent, nothing of whether she lifted, or he leapt. It is a red herring, an irrelevance. The RFEF has picked out that second half of a sentence and bolded it up like it is the key to its “truth v lies” narrative, triumphantly claiming: “The tests are conclusive. Mr President has not lied.” But it is the first half that matters: “I want to clarify, that as seen in the images, at no time did I consent to the kiss he gave me,” Hermoso says. Lift or no lift, embrace or no embrace, Rubiales and the RFEF cannot undo what we all saw (just as Manchester United and Mason Greenwood, who had all the charges against him dropped, cannot undo what we all heard) and that is the president grabbing the face of Hermoso and planting a kiss on her lips. His premise is that it was consensual, her alleged lie about the lift proves she is lying about consent, that he is the truth-teller and the truth will triumph, at least that is what we can assume. A new statement, released on Saturday, reasserted these claims of consent and said that “Mrs. Jennifer Hermoso lies in all the statements she makes against the President” before accusing her of attempting to “change reality”. But while we should take the player at her word, when she says no conversation about whether he could kiss her or not took place and that she didn’t like it, that also doesn’t matter. Consent or no consent, the president of the federation, or anyone within any workplace, should not be planting a kiss squarely on to the mouth of another person. It is wholly inappropriate and, coupled with the president’s crotch grab during the Women’s World Cup final, his carrying of Athenea del Castillo over a shoulder, the statements of support from players, clubs and administrators all alluding to a culture of fear and intimidation and the bullish and deluded response from the man himself paints a dark picture of Rubiales’ character. Rubiales and the federation need to wake up. They can stick their heads in the sand over what constitutes sexism, misogyny and abuse all they want, but that will not happen without consequence. Enough has been done and said by Rubiales with the world watching to ensure it is impossible for him to remain, despite his instance otherwise, and his stranglehold on power. Fifa has acted, banning him for 90 days while disciplinary proceedings take place; Uefa, the European governing body, must be next to respond to the overwhelming pressure to take action against its vice-president. But these organisations must look beyond the one man, at the culture of the sport as well as having an introspective look at how these individuals are able to acquire absolute power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/04/uk-must-build-power-lines-faster-to-get-backlog-of-green-energy-projects-on-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-04T07:11:04Z","webTitle":"Pay UK households who agree to have power lines nearby, report urges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/04/uk-must-build-power-lines-faster-to-get-backlog-of-green-energy-projects-on-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/04/uk-must-build-power-lines-faster-to-get-backlog-of-green-energy-projects-on-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"Homeowners in Britain should be paid “generous” compensation if they agree to have power lines built nearby in order to help speed the transmission of electricity from new generation projects, a government-commissioned report has urged. The document from the government’s first energy networks commissioner, Nick Winser, calls for new power linesto be built twice as fast to ease the decade-long backlog of renewable energy projects waiting to connect to the grid. His root-and-branch review proposes 18 measures to help clear the grid backlog after finding that “every part” of the grid upgrade process “must – and can – be dramatically improved”. These recommendations include offering lump sum payments to those living near new pylons, which it said could reduce widespread opposition to projects, and “streamlining” the planning and regulatory process. Winser warned ministers that without new cables and substations more green energy projects were likely to be rolled out before they could be connected to the grid. Currently windfarms and solar arrays face a 10- to 15-year wait to connect to the power networks because grid upgrades cannot keep pace – but these wait times could be halved to about seven years to help Britain meet its green energy targets, according to Winser. “The implications of being able to build wind generation faster than the associated connections to customers will be serious: very high congestion costs for customers, and clean, cheap domestic energy generation standing idle, potentially for years,” Winser said in a letter to Grant Shapps, the energy secretary. The queue for a UK grid connection is the longest in Europe and threatens to undermine the government’s target to roll out 50GW of new wind power and 24GW of new nuclear in the coming decades. The “magnificent achievement” would be “wasted if we cannot get the power to homes and businesses”, Winser said. The report found that grid upgrade delays could even raise energy bills by billions of pounds if the electricity system operator is forced to pay windfarms to stop generating power when constraints in the network mean that strong supplies of green energy cannot be delivered to areas of higher power demand. The grid delays have sparked a row within the industry over who bears responsibility for the backlog. Renewable energy developers have been critical of National Grid, which owns most of the UK’s power lines. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 energy company has called on the regulator, Ofgem, to change the rules to allow greater investment in its networks. Ofgem has called the delays “unacceptable”. Dan McGrail, the chief executive of the trade association RenewableUK, welcomed the report. He said: “Our electricity network is the single biggest barrier to delivering a zero-carbon power system by 2035.” Carl Trowell, the president of strategic infrastructure at National Grid, said: “There is no time to waste. Implementing the proposals and progressing the energy transition at pace is the surest route to more affordable bills, greater energy resilience and a more energy independent UK.” The recommendations include setting up a “future system operator” to undertake a forecast of the grid upgrades required across the country. It also puts forward ideas for better collaboration between the regulator, government and the companies that own Britain’s grids, which include Scottish Power and SSE as well as National Grid. It also cited the need for “transparent, respectful and efficient” engagement with local communities and people about the impact of new transmission infrastructure such as overhead power lines and substations which will be needed in the future. “Clear guidance on how communities can comment on the design of projects to reduce their visual impact, as well as ways to enable communities hosting new infrastructure to benefit from doing so, will be important steps forward,” McGrail said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T22:48:24Z","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic resists Hubert Hurkacz’s power to build two-set lead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jul/09/novak-djokovic-resists-hubert-hurkaczs-power-to-build-two-set-lead","fields":{"bodyText":"Novak Djokovic is the best tennis player in the world, yet the task of facing him on a tennis court is far more than just forehands and backhands. As a 23-time grand slam champion who has recovered from every possible scoreline deficit, few can even match up to the challenge of standing up to his aura and reputation. Late on Sunday night, as curfew beckoned and time ran out, Hubert Hurkacz fought a losing battle with Djokovic’s aura as he generated three set points before freezing in the decisive moments. Djokovic will return on Monday afternoon to complete his Wimbledon fourth round match against the Pole while leading 7-6 (6), 7-6 (6) after yet another day of play was halted by the All England Club’s strict 11pm curfew. Djokovic and Hurkacz had emerged just before 9pm after a marathon day of play on Centre Court, with Andrey Rublev narrowly surviving Alexander Bublik in five sets before Iga Swiatek, the women’s No 1, recovered from two match points down to defeat Belinda Bencic after three hours. Still, the inability of the tournament to complete a regular day’s play will lead to further criticism of the All England Club’s decision to start matches on Centre Court at 1.30pm. The defining question of the men’s tournament this year is whether anyone in the draw is truly capable of defeating Djokovic. Hurkacz, a 26-year-old who has scaled as high as No 9 and won a Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open in 2021, was on the very short list of players in the bottom half capable of causing Djokovic strife. He remains one of the few of the younger generation whose game has proven a natural fit for grass. Hurkacz’s serve, one of the best in the world, is devastating on the surface, his flatter strokes well suited to its lower bounce and the Pole’s willingness to move forward to the net is naturally rewarded on the surface. Two years ago, Hurkacz reached the Wimbledon semi-finals, defeating Roger Federer in what proved to be the final match of the Swiss’s career. Imbued with that experience of a big win on the very same court, Hurkacz flew out the blocks, easing through his opening service games while playing clear-headed attacking tennis. His serve, which scaled 141mph as the crack of the ball echoed around Centre Court, was at times unreadable for one of the best returners of all time. As Hurkacz soared, his spectacular serving meant the margins were tiny. At 3-3 in the tie-break, Djokovic double-faulted, offering up the first mini-break. Hurkacz responded swiftly, slamming down two consecutive aces that carried him to triple set point at 6-3. But then it all unravelled. After Djokovic pulled both of his service points back, at 6-5 Hurkacz fired down a 130mph serve and presented himself with an easy forehand which he dumped into the net. Two more unforced errors quickly followed from Hurkacz, who returned to chair having missed an enormous opportunity. With one set behind him the clock ticking down, Djokovic’s returning improved and he imposed maximum pressure on his challenger, who courageously hung on with the force of his serve. At 2-1, Djokovic generated a break point on Hurkacz’s serve, to which the Pole responded with three consecutive aces to hold. Djokovic pounced again, forcing triple break point at 0-40. Three unreturned serves later, the world No 18 recovered to deuce before saving a fourth break point with an incredibly fortunate stretch volley that bounced awkwardly and flew back over his side of the net. Both serves initially dominated the second-set tie-break that followed. At 5-5, though, Djokovic spectacularly retrieved a 136mph serve while lunging at full stretch, then he anticipated Hurkacz’s inside out forehand and flicked a backhand low to the Pole’s feet that set up an easy winner. Although he did not take the first set point, Djokovic took the final two points of the tie-break to establish a two-set lead. Djokovic’s suffocating aura would be nothing without the genius behind it. Throughout the match, the Serb matched Hurkacz’s enormous serving with his own precise, effective delivery. Even as he watched aces fly past him throughout the two sets, on nearly every decisive point, Djokovic found a way to land a return, to retrieve one more ball and to ensure that he gave nothing away. He forced his younger challenger to step up and beat him, and in both sets the Pole could not. After taking the second set, Djokovic immediately signalled that the match had finished for the night, tossing a wristband into the crowd before packing his bag and leaving the court alongside Hurkacz. Having opted against competing on grass between his French Open victory and the start of Wimbledon, Djokovic has been charged with finding his feet and form during the tournament. So far, things continue to go well and he will return on Monday afternoon to finish the job."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T15:00:22Z","webTitle":"Let’s talk nuclear, the Coalition says – just don’t mention cost or how long it would take | Graham Readfearn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/18/lets-talk-nuclear-the-coalition-says-just-dont-mention-cost-or-how-long-it-would-take","fields":{"bodyText":"The Coalition appears to have landed on a neat solution to decarbonising Australia’s electricity grid – just swap out the coal plants for nuclear. Writing in the Australian newspaper, the shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, said such a plan would reduce the need to spend billions on new transmission lines that would connect solar and windfarms to the grid. O’Brien wrote he had visited Wyoming, where the Bill Gates-backed company TerraPower was planning a demonstration nuclear power station on the site of a coal plant. The idea was backed by the Australian itself in an editorial that said the Coalition’s “timid embrace of nuclear must be urgently considered”. But what neither O’Brien, nor the Australian, mentions is the cost of the plant to build and the time that’s available to do it. The Albanese government wants 82% of the generation capacity in the national electricity market to be powered by renewables by 2030. Construction hasn’t started yet on TerraPower’s demonstration plant and it isn’t expected to start producing power until late 2029 (already pushed back almost two years without work having even started). The cost? The Australian doesn’t say this ether but, according to TerraPower, a budget of more than $6bn is available for the Wyoming project – shared 50/50 between the company and the federal government. The plant’s capacity is 350MW – less than a quarter the size of many coal plants. Future versions of the technology – if it succeeds – would probably get cheaper. But by then the expectation is that Australia’s electricity grid already would be running on very high levels of renewable electricity. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Argument for delay? In a pro-nuclear editorial, the Australian wrote that in a “properly planned energy transition”, policymakers should consider technology “that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions using existing network infrastructure”. According to the Australian energy regulator, the transmission network that forms part of the national electricity market is an asset worth $22.8bn. Much of that asset has been built and designed to cater for fossil fuel generation – mostly coal – which needs to be phased out to meet the country’s climate targets (and is also being pushed out by cheaper renewables whose fuel price is essentially zero). The government has promised $20bn in finance to upgrade the grid to accommodate renewable energy generation and storage. But the pace at which you could theoretically deploy the kind of “small modular reactor” nuclear plants being advocated – but not yet commercially available – would mean sitting on your hands until at least the end of the decade in the hope that the SMRs eventuate and are not eye-wateringly expensive. When the Australian and the Coalition argue for an energy transition that uses “existing infrastructure”, they’re arguing against renewables, and for delay. True costs? In two columns in recent weeks, the Australian’s Claire Lehmann has attacked a report from the CSIRO, saying one metric that’s used to illustrate how much different generation technologies cost per megawatt hour doesn’t account for the extra money spent in the network to accommodate renewables. The metric – known as the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) – in the GenCost report shows that solar and wind installed now (in a grid mostly designed for fossil fuels) are easily the cheapest. The report treats the significant costs for transmission and storage up to 2030 as “sunk” – that is, already committed. After 2030, the GenCost report does estimate the extra costs of integrating renewables but still sees them as the cheapest option – and roughly half the price of nuclear. Tennant Reed, the director of climate change and energy at the Australian Industry Group, questions the focus on LCOE. He says it is an imperfect measure – an issue acknowledged by GenCost – and has a history of being critiqued by groups. Reed says many people who are engaged in energy issues “go through a teenage phase of thinking that levelised cost of energy is the most important thing in the world” and thinking it proves more than it actually does. “It’s a rough guide, but it’s not the basis for any decisions,” he says. “There’s no effort to conceal anything here.” Communist takeover? In case you missed it, US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay almost US$1.5bn last year after claiming the 2012 mass killing of 26 staff and students at the Sandy Hook elementary school had been faked (he’s since acknowledged it happened). The One Nation senator and climate science denier Malcolm Roberts was given almost an hour on the flagship show on Jones’s InfoWars network – the Alex Jones Show – last week. “He’s a gift to Australia and gift to the world,” said the guest host on the show, introducing Roberts. What did the gift bring? It’s not really the kind of rhetoric you can factcheck but, for the record, Roberts told viewers the United Nations and the World Economic Forum were “trying to control and limit energy” and they wanted to “control everything that we eat”. “They are pushing a communist takeover,” Roberts said. “What they are wanting is global control. They’re not my words. They’ve said that.” I don’t think they have."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T14:04:50Z","webTitle":"New Jersey community loses electricity after bird drops fish on to power lines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/aug/22/new-jersey-fish-hawk-power-outage","fields":{"bodyText":"An unusual suspect is being sought by police for a power outage in New Jersey: an osprey that dropped a fish on to power lines, causing a nearby community to temporarily lose their electricity. A fish that fell from the grip of the bird in question landed on a transformer in Sayreville, New Jersey, on 12 August, causing the coils within it to become misaligned, according to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, a utility company. This caused about 2,000 people to lose power, the company said. While animals can sometimes cause power outages, “fish are not on the list of frequent offenders”, a company spokesperson said. “We also send our thoughts to the osprey because if you’ve ever dropped your ice-cream cone at the fair, you know the feeling.” It’s suspected that an osprey was responsible for the unexpected, fishy interruption. The fish’s scales appeared punctured, likely by talons, and it is thought that it was then dropped over the power lines. Ospreys were previously endangered in New Jersey but are now recovering, with 733 nesting pairs of the large, fish-eating raptors documented across the state in a survey last year. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light said that it regularly inspects its equipment to see if ospreys have nested there, relocating them if necessary. Police in Sayreville, somewhat tongue in cheek, posted a suspect sketch of an osprey on Facebook, along with a picture of the fish, which was given the name Gilligan, with a “police line do not cross” tape in front of it. “Please let us not forget the victim in this senseless death,” the police force posted. “Gilligan was a hard working family man. He was a father to thousands of children. The suspect was last seen flying south. If you see him do not try to apprehend him. Although he isn’t believed to be armed he may still be very dangerous.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2023.
