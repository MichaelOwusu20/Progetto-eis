He then cites Ireland as an example of indirect election of presidents. In fact, the Irish presidency is directly elected. Mr Meadowcroft also cites the example of Donald Trump to support his argument. The issue in respect of Trump is not that the head of state is directly elected, it is that the head of state in the US is also effectively head of government. I agree that some politicians become addicted to power, but that is caused by the drug of governmental power, not the drug of presidency. I doubt that Trump would have had any interest in the presidency if the US had an Irish-style system where he would have had only ceremonial duties. In another letter, Margaret Squires expresses concerns about a President Thatcher or Blair. Again, I would doubt that a limited, ceremonial presidency would have held any attraction for them. And even if an electorate does choose a questionable president, they get the chance to get rid of them a few years later. If you have a questionable monarch, you have no choice but to wait for them to expire or abdicate.

If you haven’t heard of it, allow me to explain it. But strap yourself in, because hoo boy. Power Slap is a televised “sport” in which two people slap one other as hard as they can, with the aim of incapacitating their opponent to the point of unconsciousness. The players take turns unloading slaps so hard that it is uncomfortable to watch, while the opponent must stand with their arms by their side, since the rules forbid any form of defence (or even flinching). Power Slap has no British broadcaster, but in the US, where it is shown on TBS, it has caused a firestorm, not least because it is objectively stupid and dangerous, with slap fighters often ending up swollen and disfigured, and neurologists condemning the potential injuries they could sustain through repeated concussive impact to the head. And the people who run the league aren’t exactly lovely either. The show’s premiere was delayed, in fact, due to a video of Power Slap producer Dana White hitting his wife. A recent New Yorker piece did a good job of corralling the outrage. The boxer Ryan Garcia said: “Power slap is a horrible idea and it needs to be stopped.” Ariel Helwani, a sports journalist who reports on mixed martial arts, took aim at the state from which Power Slap is broadcast, saying: “Shame on Nevada for sanctioning that.” Even JT Tilley, who operates his own slap-fight league, admits that “90% of people can’t stand this sport”. But Power Slap is not just a sport. It is also a reality show, with the fighters all living together in a nice house, like the contestants on The Apprentice. The difference is that when the fighters leave the house, it is to hit each other as hard as they can. Does this make Power Slap the most awful reality show in the history of television? Not by a long shot. It sounds awful and exploitative, but is it any more awful and exploitative than Cheaters? That was the show in which members of the public could spy on their partners to see if they were unfaithful, before catching them in the act and – more often than not – having a screaming, knock-down fight with them. There was nothing about Cheaters that didn’t turn the stomach, yet it ran for more than 20 years. Is it worse than Fear Factor, a gameshow in which contestants had to commit to some of the most stomach-churning acts imaginable to win some cash? One episode, queasily titled Hee Haw! Hee Haw!, was so hideous that it was only shown on TV once, thanks to a challenge in which guests had to chug donkey semen and urine. But the most gruesome reality show of all time is probably The Moment of Truth, a 2008 US gameshow so sickening that 15 of its episodes were never aired. The premise? A subject is strapped to a polygraph and asked 100 questions of increasing intimacy. The more of these questions they agree to answer on air, the more money they win. In one episode, introduced by its own host as a piece of TV that didn’t deserve to see the light of day, a woman admitted to stealing money from work, to wishing she had married someone other than her husband (who was in the audience with his head in his hands), and to having sex with other men since being married. She was eliminated for answering yes to the question “Are you a good person?”. It was unimaginably horrible from start to finish. In fact, Power Slap may not even qualify as the worst reality show of the moment. Netflix is producing Squid Game: The Challenge, in which the fictional lethal knockout game is played for real by members of the public. While the reality version draws a line at killing the participants, there have been reports that multiple contestants have required medical assistance during filming, with others likening it to a war zone. It certainly sounds as if it will be very difficult to watch. Does Power Slap sound good? No. But the worst ever? Let’s retain some perspective."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T19:20:24Z","webTitle":"Are Putin’s nuclear threats really likely to lead to Armageddon?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/07/biden-putin-nuclear-threats-tactical-strike-us-response-analysis","fields":{"bodyText":"The past week has seen a rapid escalation in nuclear rhetoric, beginning with Vladimir Putin’s threat to use “all forces and means” to defend newly seized territory in Ukraine and ending with Joe Biden’s warning of “Armageddon” if Russia crosses the nuclear Rubicon. However, the realities underlying the menacing vocabulary are a far greyer area than the bluster suggests. It is far from certain that Putin would be prepared to be the first leader to use nuclear weapons in wartime since 1945, over his territorial ambitions in Ukraine. If his primary goal is to stay in power, that could be exactly the wrong way of going about it. Even if he did issue the launch order, he has no guarantee it would be carried out. Nor can he be absolutely sure that the weapons and their delivery systems would work. On the US side, despite the US president’s apocalyptic language at a private fundraiser on Thursday night, it is not at all inevitable that Washington would respond to Putin’s nuclear use with nuclear retaliation. Past wargaming suggests there would be vigorous debate within the administration to say the least. Like US presidents, Putin is normally accompanied by an aide carrying a briefcase with codes used to authorise a nuclear launch. In the US it is called the football, in Russia it is the cheget. In the Russian system, the defence minister and the chief of the general staff have their own chegets but it is believed that Putin can order a launch without them. However, the cheget is relevant for the strategic nuclear forces, the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from land or sea, or long-range bombers. Because they need to be launched within minutes in case of enemy attack, the warheads need to be deployed, mounted on the delivery systems. Any nuclear use in Ukraine would be likely to involve non-strategic, or tactical, weapons with shorter-range delivery systems, and which are usually (but not necessarily) less powerful than strategic arms, though on average they are many times more powerful that the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs. The US only has one kind of tactical weapon, the B61 gravity bomb, of which there are about a hundred in Europe and a similar number in the US, according to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). FAS estimates Russia has 2,000 tactical weapons, in very many shapes and sizes for use on land, sea and air. The weapons are not deployed on missiles or aircraft, but kept in bunkers in storage sites dotted around Russia. There are 12 national storage sites, known in Russian military parlance as “Object S”, one of which is in Belgorod, right on the Ukrainian border. There are also 34 “base-level” sites, closer to the delivery systems. In a time of crisis, warheads would be moved from national to base-level sites – and up to now western intelligence agencies say no such movement has been observed. Any such movement would be carried out by the 12th main directorate of the Russian armed forces, which has the job of storing and maintaining the warheads and then delivering them in specialised trains or trucks to base-level sites, or directly to the unit designated to launch them. Pavel Baev, a military researcher who worked for the Soviet defence ministry, said that Putin cannot count on these weapons actually working. “Most of these warheads stored there are very old,” Baev, now a professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said. “Without testing it’s really hard to say how suitable they are because many of them are past their expiration date.” Baev added that it was also far from clear that the Russian can successfully pair old warheads with the much newer delivery systems that would have to be used, possibly 9K720 Iskander or Kinzhal hypersonic missiles. Not all analysts have such a dim view of the state of the tactical arsenal. Pavel Podvig, who runs a research project called Russian Nuclear Forces and is a senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said: “There’s a maintenance protocol. There are ways of checking whether a weapon is in good health.” What may be more likely to break down, however, is the chain of command if Putin gave such an alarming and extreme order. “It’s one thing to follow the order to start a ‘special military operation’ that you understand will be over in three days,” Podvig said. “It’s another thing to accept the order to drop a nuclear bomb. There’s a sense that this kind of order would be universally considered as criminal. I think the calculation would change.” The Russian leader is already reported to be facing dissent from his inner circle. Taking the leap to nuclear use could stretch his authority to breaking point. “I think it would be prohibitively risky for any commander-in-chief to give this order because if you give the order and it’s not executed, it backfires,” Baev said. If Putin decided to gamble everything and if his military officers went along with him and managed to detonate a weapon in or around Ukraine, then Biden and his team would be faced with choices that all modern US presidents have hoped they would never have to make. US warnings to Russia in recent days have been vague on what the response would be, saying only that it would be “catastrophic”. The White House needs to keep its room for manoeuvre, depending on what Russia does, whether it is a “demonstration” blast over the Black Sea or the Arctic, or the bombing of a Ukrainian military target or – the worst-case scenario – a city. In 2016, the Obama administration carried out war gaming exercises to test its communications channels and decision-making process in the event of a Russian use of a tactical nuclear weapon. There were deep disagreements that led on some occasions to heated arguments. “The debate broke down along two pretty important lines,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was Barack Obama’s special assistant and senior director at the national security council for arms control and non-proliferation. The first question was whether “the US or Nato needed to respond militarily”. “In the game, the answer was no. The US was winning the conventional war,” Wolfsthal, who writes a Substack column titled BoomBoomBoom, said. The counter-argument was that the US could not afford not to respond with nuclear weapons. “There were those who said if you don’t use nuclear weapons, two terrible things will happen. One is: all of our allies will doubt our commitment,” he said. “The second is: if you don’t use a nuclear weapon in response, how do you deter Putin from going nuclear again? You needed nukes to re-establish deterrence. “We never answered that. We never settled that debate,” Wolfsthal said. The 2016 war game – first reported in The Bomb, a book by Fred Kaplan – was played twice, at the level of cabinet secretary, the “principals” and by their deputies. The principals voted to respond with a nuclear strike, but not on Russia, in the hope of avoiding an all-out planet-ending nuclear exchange. Instead they struck Belarus, arguing it was a “belligerent non-combatant”. The deputies voted not to respond with nuclear weapons, arguing that the US could win with conventional weapons and that nuclear use would make it much harder to isolate Putin internationally. Two of the officials who pushed that option are now in senior positions in the Biden administration: Colin Kahl is the Pentagon’s policy chief, and Avril Haines is the director of national intelligence. After the war games were over, Haines suggested having T-shirts printed with the slogan “Deputies Should Run the World”. The 2016 war game was set in a Baltic nation, so inside Nato and under its protective nuclear umbrella. Ukraine stands outside that umbrella. Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary is reported to have voted for a nuclear response in 2016. He would not comment or even confirm the war game took place, but he said Ukraine was a very different case. “I would say that if the line is crossed to nuclear use, there has to be a very, very strong response,” he told the Guardian. “But that response doesn’t have to be nuclear.” The key question is more likely to be whether the US and its allies should respond with devastating conventional firepower, as Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, and the former CIA director David Petraeus have suggested. But that would transform the war into one between Russia and Nato, in which escalation to a nuclear exchange could become hard to stop. According to Eric Schlosser, the author of a book about the nuclear establishment, Command and Control, the Pentagon’s Defence Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) conducted another war game in 2019 focused on Russian nuclear use in Ukraine. That wargame appears to have been updated, suggesting it is in constant use. The results in 2019 are top secret, but as Schlosser wrote in the Atlantic, one of the participants told him: “There were no happy outcomes.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T23:48:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 477 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. “This is incredibly difficult,” the official said. “They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.” Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. “It is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,” he said. Three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. Three people were killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia’s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world’s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T10:00:02Z","webTitle":"US elementary school tested for nuclear bomb waste from Manhattan Project","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/02/us-elementary-school-nuclear-bomb-waste-from-manhattan-project","fields":{"bodyText":"The US army corps of engineers is testing for radioactivity in the kindergarten play yard, sports fields and classrooms of a Missouri school serving mostly Black students, after an independent report revealed the school may have been contaminated by nuclear bomb-making waste dumped from the second world war’s Manhattan Project. Children from Jana elementary school in the Northern St Louis area were sent home to do online learning last week, following an independent report that found levels of the radioactive isotype lead-210 as much as 22 times the expected levels in the school’s play yards and some indoor spaces. For decades nearby areas of North St Louis have been undergoing cleanup for radioactive dumping dating back to the 1940s through 1960s, after the region played an integral role in processing uranium for the development of the atomic bomb. Radioactive hotspots have been discovered in Coldwater Creek, which runs next to the original disposal sites some four miles from the school and then snakes past the school itself. The independent study released in October by a radiation testing firm, the Boston Chemical Data Corp, revealed concerning levels of radiation in locations including inside the school and its play yards. This prompted last week’s school shutdown. The report, which was paid for by a local law firm, also found levels of radium-226 in the school’s soil at double the expected background levels. The report said the level of radioactive lead found on the school grounds was many times higher than the levels allowed by the EPA for Superfund sites, the highly toxic places slated for government cleanups. It said the lead-210 likely resulted from the breakdown of other nuclear waste ingredients. “Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210 found on school grounds were entirely unacceptable,” said the report. It noted that the lead emits alpha particles, which are among the most biologically damaging type of radiation. The US army corps of engineers, which is in charge of the radiation cleanup, has questioned the findings of that report. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the corps was evaluating the independent study and would release its conclusions, as well as the results of its new sampling, in the next two weeks. It said that in 2018 and 2019 its own experts had “identified an area of low-level radioactive contamination on a densely wooded bank of Coldwater Creek. This area is just inside the edge of the school property and not easily accessible.” On Wednesday, teams of its workers in yellow and orange vests fanned out around the school grounds to redo the testing. One worker scanned the school lawn with a radiation detection device mounted on the end of a pole, others marked spots on the sports fields with bright orange bags, while a group of workers operating a boring machine collected core samples from the earth as deep as 28ft beneath the school. “Our team has the right expertise and experience to complete this work,” said Col. Kevin Golinghorst, the Corps’ St Louis District commander in a press release. Two blocks away from the school in a yellow and white tract home proudly displaying a sign on the porch that reads “Jana Elementary Student of the Month”, parent Rodney Green watched his two daughters studying math and English at his dining room table. “We already had to do this online learning during the pandemic – now it’s this,” he said. He was considering taking them to a doctor to test them for radiation effects. Now he worries about his home, which sits only a few houses from the creek. “What if we can’t live out here? Do I have to sell?” he said. “This is a whole community that’s affected. It’s crazy.” School PTA President Ashley Bernaugh, who has been asking for answers since the Army Corps first began testing near the school in 2018, said that she believes cleanup would have happened a lot faster if Jana elementary wasn’t in a mostly Black area. “Jana elementary’s radioactive past looks like a lot of other communities where hazardous waste has been allowed to exist in predominantly minority communities and in lower middle income communities, where it never would have been allowed in upper income level communities because of the public outrage,” said Bernaugh. The history of the radioactive waste in Northern St Louis goes back to 1942, when a company called Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, located along the Mississippi River in the city’s downtown, was contracted by the federal government to process the uranium that was eventually sent to New Mexico to make atomic bombs. The waste from that operation was stored near what is now the St Louis airport. In the 1960s, the waste was transferred to another company, which sold off valuable ingredients and transferred other portions of the waste to two other dump sites in the area. Cleanup of the dumps began in the late 1990s. Residents have been concerned about the health effects of lingering radiation for years. A 2013 Missouri health study found that the number of cases of leukemia, and breast, colon, prostrate, kidney and bladder cancers faced by residents in zip codes near the creek were “statistically significantly higher” than the rate for the rest of Missouri, according to reporting by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Jared Opsal, executive director of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, worried the radiation discovered at the school could pose particular dangers to children. “People – and especially children – should not still be collateral damage for World War II,” said Opsal, who said he hopes the federal government will expand and speed up its cleanup efforts, now slated to go on until 2038. “This is WWII nuclear weapons waste and people are still being harmed by it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-02T17:51:19Z","webTitle":"Finnish PM faces battle to hang on to power as general election goes to wire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/02/finland-begins-voting-in-knife-edge-election","fields":{"bodyText":"Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, was facing a battle to hold on to power on Sunday with the country’s conservative opposition National Coalition party (NCP) holding a narrow early lead in a knife-edge general election. Among the 40% of voters who cast their ballots before election day, the NCP garnered a score of 20.8%, fractionally ahead of Marin’s centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on 20.7%. The far-right nationalist Finns party scored 18.6%. The early vote tally is often skewed, however, and analysts warned against reading too much into the partial results as counting continued. Marin said after seeing the early results she was confident her party would win a big share of election-day votes. The party winning the vote will have the first shot at forming a coalition, but talks are set to be long and tortuous, with polls in the election run-up showing the three main parties in an almost dead heat and reliant on smaller parties to form a coalition. Marin, 37, became the world’s youngest prime minister when she assumed the leadership of the SDP – and the Finnish premiership – in 2019 and has successfully led the country through the Covid pandemic and to the brink of Nato membership. Her determination to enjoy a social life has also made headlines, with fans hailing her as a rising star of the centre-left and model for a new generation of young female leaders. Critics argue that her behaviour has at times been inappropriate for her office. She was forced to apologise and took a drug test last year, but also defended her right to party, after photos and video emerged of her drinking and dancing with friends. Marin remains more popular than her party and rival political leaders, with an opinion poll for the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper in December finding 64% of respondents felt she had done a “very” or “fairly” good job as prime minister. But with recession forecast and inflation surging, opposition leaders’ accusations of excessive government borrowing and inflated public spending – along with their pledges to impose tough cuts, particularly on welfare budgets – have proved effective. The NCP’s Petteri Orpo has promised to slash spending on unemployment and housing benefits. “The most important thing in the next government is to fix our economy and push economic growth,” he said during campaigning. Riikka Purra of the Finns – who were part of a coalition government from 2015 to 2017 – says their priority is to cut non-EU immigration, promising also to focus on climate, crime and energy policies if it is part of the new coalition. Whoever emerges as the winner, coalition negotiations are set to be tough, with the SDP and two of its current five-party coalition, the Greens and the Left Alliance, all ruling out any alliance with with the Finns, which Marin has called “openly racist”. Of the two others, the Swedish People’s party, a moderate party representing Swedish-speaking Finns, has said it is “very unlikely” to partner with the far-right Finns. The once-powerful agrarian Centre party, on the other hand, whose vote has plunged in recent years, will not join any coalition resembling the current one. The NCP has not excluded any combination, saying it will wait to see the results. If the NCP finishes first, it could try to put together a right-leaning “blue-black” coalition with the Finns, or pursue a broad “blue-red” alliance with the SDP, an outcome many analysts see as most likely despite obvious policy differences. As many as 10 parties could win seats in the 200-seat parliament. The outcome should be clear by midnight."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T17:53:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 191 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-191-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The Russian energy giant Gazprom has announced that the Nord Stream pipeline 1 will not restart on schedule on Saturday. In a statement, the company claimed it had detected an oil leak at the main gas turbine at Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. It said the turbine could not operate safely until the leak was repaired, with no indication of how long that may take. An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plans to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of experts had stayed behind at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he said. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. The Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials were “making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit”. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday: “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA, which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” G7 finance ministers have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, the ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin warned that imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders decided to impose price caps on Russian oil, it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in the 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes. The government has said Ukraine could harvest 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying: “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continued to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counter-offensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova on Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Children returned to Ukrainian schools left damaged by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. A senior Russian oil executive died on Thursday after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:22:02Z","webTitle":"Russia readies for southern offensive as alarm raised over shelling of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. The assessment came as both sides traded blame for renewed shelling on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with the UN nuclear watchdog raising grave concerns about the attack. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” said the UK’s defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief. According to a separate source with Ukraine’s military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source. One of the major obstacles to Ukraine’s offensive in the south could be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe’s largest, which was shelled on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it was a crime and “an act of terror”, saying the shelling was carried out by Russian forces. In a phone call on Sunday with the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, about the plant, Zelenskiy called for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry and nuclear fuel in response. But the head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. It was not possible on Saturday to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. Ukraine’s nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said that containers of spent fuel had been hit in the latest shelling, damaging three radiation monitoring sensors and injuring one employee. Spent fuel is highly radioactive, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a statement on Telegram, Energoatom said the damage meant it was currently impossible to detect increased radiation or leakage of radiation from the spent fuel containers. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the size of the plant “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond”. The UK’s defence ministry predicts Russia’s war in Ukraine will soon enter a “new phase” as it believes the fighting will shift from Donbas to a 217-mile front stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson. At present, the brunt of Russia’s attacks is around what remains of Ukrainian-controlled eastern Donbas. Russian forces are still trying to achieve their aim of capturing the whole of Donbas. Russian forces now control Luhansk oblast, with the exception of a few small settlements, and about half of Donetsk oblast. Russia is currently carrying out two offensives to capture the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka and continuing to shell dozens of towns and villages from all directions, according to a statement by Ukraine’s general staff. Russian forces now appear to be occupying the southern part of Pisky, a village in Donetsk oblast near Avdivvka, as well as the small settlement of Travneve, 11 miles south of Bakhmut, according to the ISW, which reported that the Ukrainian army seemed to be holding the line elsewhere. Ukraine’s general staff said on Sunday that Russia was deploying troops and air defence systems to Belarus. However, the same Ukrainian military intelligence source said no offensive formations had been detected in Belarus, though rocket attacks from its northern neighbour continued to be a threat. Meanwhile, four more ships successfully left Ukraine’s ports, raising hopes that the deal brokered by Turkey and the UN to end Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports might hold. Russia’s decision to strike Odesa port hours after the deal was signed cast doubt on that. The deal is valid for 120 days and can be renewed if both sides agree. The first ship to set sail from Ukraine’s ports since the invasion left on Monday. Twenty million tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since February, pushing some import-dependent countries in the Middle East and north Africa toward famine. Before the war, Ukraine exported some 6m to 8m tons of grain a month. Using its rivers and railways, Ukraine is managing to export about 2m tons a month and hopes the reopening of its ports will increase the total to 3m a month in four to six weeks’ time, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told Bloomberg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"Guardian Essential poll: majority of Australians favour capping power prices, lifting wages and cheaper childcare","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/04/guardian-essential-poll-majority-of-australians-favour-capping-power-prices-lifting-wages-and-cheaper-childcare","fields":{"bodyText":"More than three-quarters of voters support capping electricity and gas prices and reducing the tax on petrol as Australians call for more cost-of-living relief in the lead-up to the budget. The Guardian Essential poll of 1,133 people found 77% of voters approve those measures, with a majority also in favour of increasing the minimum wage, cheaper childcare and cutting income tax. Voters were also overwhelmingly of the view that the prime minister should be required to get parliamentary approval before going to war, with 90% in favour and just 10% saying they should not need approval. Last week a parliamentary inquiry recommended that parliament have input after the decision to go to war, with ministers forced to explain the “legal basis” for going to war. The poll found respondents under cost-of-living pressure on a range of expenses, including 70% finding it “a bit difficult” or “struggling” to afford housing expenses including rent and mortgage payments, and 64% who said the same of utility bills. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Most voters said that governments could make a difference to the cost of living: 31% said “a lot” of difference, 40% “a fair amount”, 18% “not that much”, 5% “hardly anything” and 6% “unsure”. Support was highest for capping prices for electricity and gas, and reducing fuel excise, with 77% describing these as “something that would make a difference and the government should do”. However, 18% said cutting petrol tax was “something that would make a difference but the government should not do” and a further 5% said it wouldn’t work. A majority were also in favour of increasing the minimum wage (73%), making childcare cheaper (66%), cutting income tax (60%) and changing industrial laws so it’s easier for workers to negotiate pay rises (57%). On Friday the Albanese government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission’s annual minimum wage review calling for the wages of the low-paid to keep up with inflation. In the lead-up to the May budget the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has said the government’s job is to look at “how we can provide cost-of-living relief” without making the job of the Reserve Bank to reduce inflation harder. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said cost-of-living relief was a “priority” but needed to be provided in “the most responsible and affordable way consistent with the budget constraints that we’ve got, as well”. In addition to capping coal and gas prices, the energy price relief plan passed in December promised $1.5bn in consumer rebates to flow after the budget. In September, Labor made the unpopular decision to allow the temporary six-month halving of petrol tax to lapse. The poll was conducted last week after Labor and the Greens announced a deal with an absolute cap on emissions that helped the government pass its safeguard mechanism requiring industries to reduce emissions intensity in the Senate. The poll found the proportion of Australians who say not enough is being done to combat climate change fell four points to 39%, while those who said it is doing too much increased by four points to 16%. Thirty-three per cent said it was doing enough – up one point – while 12% said they did not know. About half (51%) backed the establishment of a national authority to manage the transition to renewable energy, a proposal supported by Australian unions and the Greens. Half were in support of “governments assessing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions when considering the approval of new projects, including coal and gas”, another measure backed by the Greens but rejected by Labor in negotiations. Despite the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, citing earlier Guardian Essential polling that 62% of Australians want to stop new coal, the new poll found support drops to just 34% when respondents were asked about “ending all future coal mining and gas extraction projects”. The safeguard deal imposed a requirement of net zero emissions on the Beetaloo basin and liquefied natural gas export projects, but not gas for domestic consumption, reflecting Labor’s view new projects might be needed to support its use as a transition fuel. There was a small movement within the margin of error in relation to Anthony Albanese’s approval, down one point to 52%, with disapproval up one to 35%. A bigger increase was recorded among those who said they “strongly disapproved” of the job he was doing, up three points to 17%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T05:01:08Z","webTitle":"US utilities shut off power to millions amid record corporate profits – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/29/us-utilities-shut-off-power-to-millions-amid-record-profits","fields":{"bodyText":"Some of America’s largest utilities cut power to millions of struggling customers in recent years even as they spent billions of dollars on stock buybacks, dividend payments to shareholders and executive salaries, a new analysis of industry data has found. The report also reveals that companies could use just a tiny fraction of their investor and executive spending to forgive debt at all households where power was cut. The shutoffs disproportionately affect low-income customers and those from communities of color, and the “harrowing” situation is driven by corporate profiteering, said Selah Goodson Bell, a study co-author and energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity. Losing power has an often devastating impact on a household, including in terms of health and safety. “Shutoffs allow corporate utilities to punish customers’ economic precarity while guaranteeing record profits and massive payouts for themselves and their investors,” the authors wrote in the report. It was compiled with the utility industry analyst Energy and Policy Institute and BailoutWatch. In the 30 states where shutoff data was available, utilities cut service 1.5m times during the first 10 months of 2022, and an estimated 4.2m times nationwide. The report also reveals the issue is worsening: the number of electric shutoffs jumped by nearly one-third and gas shutoffs spiked by 76% between 2021 and the first 10 months of 2022. Illinois posted the highest number of shutoffs during that time period at over 500,000, and it was followed by Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Ohio. Exelon Corp, the parent company to utility giants like ComEd in Illinois and Peco in Pennsylvania, reported 648,000 shutoffs. It was followed by The Southern Co, DTE Energy, Ameren and FirstEnergy. Some of the companies that probably have the highest totals aren’t included. Between 2020-2021, Florida utilities shut off power 1.4m times, a “staggering” figure largely driven by NextEra’s Florida Light and Power division. But Florida no longer requires utilities to keep track of disconnections. The report highlighted how little utilities would need to cut into dividends, stock buybacks and executive salaries to forgive customer debt. It examined financial filings from 12 large utilities responsible for 86% of the shutoffs between January 2020 and October 2022. On average each spent about $4bn on dividends, and customer debt from their collective 4.9m shutoffs totaled about 1% of their dividend spending. “That was one of the data points that really hit home because that’s just such a small scrape of the amount of money that utilities are shelling out to shareholders that could really change lives in millions of households,” Goodson Bell said. FirstEnergy, which serves Maryland, Pennsylvania and Ohio, shut off power about 240,000 times for customer debts totalling about $25m. Meanwhile, the company paid $2.3bn in dividends. The 12 companies collectively paid about 70 top executives $1.2bn, or about $5.9m annually per executive. NextEra, which cut power most frequently before it was no longer required to report data, is much more generous to its executives and shareholders. The company paid the highest average pay-per-executive at $11.2m, and spent the second highest on dividends at $8.1bn. Increasing gas and electricity prices are partly driving the number of shutoffs, but so are regulatory decisions to allow companies to almost always pass on increased costs to customers. Utilities also continue investing in capital-intensive projects that in many cases are good for their investors but not cost effective for consumers, who could benefit from community solar, rooftop solar or other distributed energy sources. As climate change creates more extreme hot and cold, more pressure is put on low-income customers who can’t afford the extra use of a furnace or air conditioner. The authors say addressing the situation would require including uniform federal record keeping, a halt on new fossil fuel investment, and a ban on punitive billing practices. States could tax utility profits to pay off customer debt, design more effective debt relief programs, eliminate consumer debt, and develop a percentage-of-income-based payment plan. But the clearest solution, Goodson Bell said, is a ban on shutoffs. “Since we see energy as a human right and shutoffs are not something that the utility industry needs to do to financially operate, we’re calling for a permanent ban,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"bodyText":"The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-24T12:44:59Z","webTitle":"How Landscape made Einstein a Go-Go: ‘It was so ahead of its time we waited a few months to release it’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jul/24/einstein-a-go-go-landscape-john-l-walters-richard-james-burgess","fields":{"bodyText":"John L Walters, songwriter, electronics, Lyricon We had been this cult and edgy instrumental jazz-punk-indie band that no one would sign. The nicest rejection letter I got was from Quincy Jones: “Great horns, great arrangements, pass owing to time commitments.” I’d started the band as a nine-piece to play my own music, which wasn’t very economically viable. We got it down to five and decided we’d try to make the band sound as big as possible using electronics. We were very conscious of the way technology was changing everything. Einstein a Go-Go was one of my first attempts at writing a tune to be played on a Lyricon – an electronic wind instrument that has a six-octave range. We actually demonstrated it on Tomorrow’s World. For Einstein a Go-Go, I programmed a simple drumbeat on a Dr Rhythm drum machine, then came up with the hook based on the jazz tunes I used to write in school. We’d always been instrumental, but I’d met Ian Dury on the pub circuit and been really inspired by the way he combined a big band with spoken-word lyrics, which had taken him from a cult act to No 1. My initial concept for the song was a joke based on the fact that Einstein played violin: “Don’t you know anything about time, Albert?” I’d read his biography and was also thinking about his famous quote that “God does not play dice” with the universe. But when I took the tune to Richard he said: “No, let’s make it about someone who idolises Einstein but is actually a nuclear terrorist.” The phone calls in the intro are genuine ones to the Kremlin and the White House. When we asked “Can we speak to President Carter?” they played for time so they could trace the call. Then we called the Iranian embassy: “Can we speak to the Ayatollah?” If you did all that today they’d send a Swat team, but we had a sign in the studio reading “No compromise”. We felt that the record company was going to drop us anyway so we might as well go for it. Richard James Burgess, songwriter, vocals, electronics I knew there was no way we’d have success with another instrumental album, but we also felt that bringing in a singer with a big ego could upset the chemistry and friendships we’d built up while doing over 200 gigs a year. So we decided to do it ourselves. I’d written lyrics in bands since my teens, so I ended up on vocals. The hot topic at the time was how the UK would have five minutes’ warning if the Soviet Union launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. We bounced that idea around and came up with a more cartoon Einstein reference: “Albert says that E = MC squared.” Superficially it’s a jokey, nothing song but it’s actually about the very scary subject of religious fundamentalism. Hence the line “Bible says we must pay. I am the judge for the judgment day.” We’d been out to Peter Gabriel’s place in Bath to borrow his Fairlight [synthesiser and sampler] and he’d played us his new song, Intruder. I was really struck by its idea of a malevolent presence, and made our song about a fundamentalist terrorist. We did all the pre-production in my house in Camberwell, then went into a proper studio to do vocals, guitar overdubs and such. Programming everything on a Roland MicroComposer was a very laborious process and if there was a power cut you lost everything. I’d been going to the Blitz club and realised the New Romantic scene was developing. After I played our stuff to Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp, he asked me to produce them, and I think the wind behind Spandau helped us. Also, the video was critically important to Einstein a Go-Go becoming a hit. We used dancers from [dance troupe] Shock, drums that looked like human faces and we had [trombonist] Pete Thoms’ disembodied head saying “Einstein a Go-Go.” The record stalled at No 32, but having played drums on Top of the Pops before with the Buggles, I knew that whenever a booked live act got stuck in fog at the airport, the BBC would more than likely replace them with a video. I told our manager to get down there with the video and that’s exactly what happened, which helped the song into the Top 5. Einstein a Go-Go always felt a bit ahead of its time. We actually held it back for a few months because we felt it would get more attention in 1981 than 1980.

Setting a text by Tazewell Thompson, it’s an angry but lyrical work that deals unflinchingly with the impact of racial discrimination, police brutality and racially motivated violence on a Black family in present day Harlem. The narrative is horribly and tragically familiar. Tazewell’s relatively straightforward dramatic premise brings complex emotional resonances in its wake. At the work’s centre is the murder, at a peaceful protest, of a Black policeman’s son by one of his father’s white colleagues, an act that is never shown, though we witness the events that surround it. Around the time of his birth, the boy’s mother and her friends worry about his future in a prejudiced world, and years later we find father and son locked in ideological conflict over the former’s job. After the murder, there is only grief, as a painful confrontation between the father and the Reverend who fails to console him leads us to the son’s funeral. There are no easy answers to anything we have seen, and at the end an epilogue takes us back to what, we gradually realise, was the family’s last meal together. Tesori’s score largely adheres to traditional structures of arias and ensembles, though it also has a directness of expression that proves persuasive. The pace falters at the start with a meandering extended quartet for the mother and her friends, but the music gradually begins to hit home. The scene for the father and the Reverend, and an agonised aria for the mother, have considerable power. There are allusions throughout to gospel, blues and jazz, and a swerve towards oratorio in the formal hymns and rituals of the son’s funeral. Craig’s effective staging confines the action in a succession of cramped domestic interiors but uses video to take us through the streets of Harlem and chart the emergence of the political movements that drive the son on. There are blazing central performances – wonderfully sung and acted with passionate conviction – from Nadine Benjamin and Kenneth Kellogg as the mother and father.

Among his accusers was his own mother, forced to join in the taunting. China’s future leader was targeted mostly because his father, a top Communist cadre, was purged by Chairman Mao Zedong. His fall dragged the family down too; Xi’s half-sister died, reportedly after intense abuse. Half a century later, the teenage boy publicly humiliated in the capital has become China’s most powerful ruler since Mao, and perhaps – given his singular control of a superpower – the most powerful man in the world. His rise was not predestined. He fought his way to the top over decades, but with such discretion that when he took over in 2012, almost no one knew what type of leader he would be. His father, Xi Zhongxun, had been a respected party elder and a former vice-premier known for a relatively liberal outlook. For years, reformers inside and outside China hoped his son might have inherited his politics along with a strong physical resemblance. Instead, the younger Xi has bolstered the party and its networks of surveillance and control over individuals and business. He swept away norms of collective rule instituted after Mao died to concentrate power in his own hands, and fostered a personality cult to bolster his strongman approach. He is all but certain to end this week confirmed as national leader for a historic third term, and with his approach, which combines repression and surveillance at home with aggression abroad, cemented in place for at least five more years. A ‘red princeling’ shaped by Maoist indoctrination Xi was born a “red princeling”, a child of the Communist party elite, in 1953, four years after Mao declared the establishment of the new People’s Republic. His earliest years were a gilded, gated existence as a child of a senior party leader. He was educated in the elite August 1st School, a cradle of future leaders. The Cultural Revolution, launched by Mao in 1966 as part of an internal power struggle, shattered that world permanently. But there had been earlier warnings of horrors to come. In 1962, when Xi was nine, his father had a spectacular fall from grace. Accused of leading an “anti-party clique” – in the obscure world of elite Chinese politics part of the case against him was support for an obliquely critical novel – the elder Xi was sent into internal exile, managing a tractor factory hundreds of miles away. Then came the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, when violent gangs of ideologically crazed teenage “red guards” held all of China ransom. At its peak, the elder Xi was beaten, publicly interrogated and paraded through the streets. He spent most of the following decade in prison. His downfall meant the next generation of his family became targets too. Xi Jinping’s half-sister is thought to have killed herself after intense persecution. At one point the future national leader was in a small group ambushed by club-wielding red guards at school and had to literally run for his life. The atmosphere was so volatile that when Xi once fled detention and ran home, his mother promptly reported him to authorities to avoid being accused of shielding him and bringing further trouble to the family, according to an account by Yang Ping, a friend of his father. “I had a stubborn streak in me and I couldn’t stand being bullied,” Xi recalled in an essay published in 2002. “I antagonised the radicals [red guards], and they blamed me for everything that went wrong.” In 1968, as part of Mao’s campaign to send young people to the countryside to be “re-educated” by peasants, Xi was sent to live in a tiny village in China’s north-west, to help with back-breaking rural labour. In the official narrative, Xi’s endurance of hardship in this period toughened him; Liangjiahe has now been turned into a pilgrimage site. “When I went to the countryside as a 15-year-old, I was perplexed and lost. By the time I left at the age of 22, I had a clear life goal and was filled with confidence,” he wrote in the 2002 essay. Xi returned to Beijing when universities reopened seven years later, and he was accepted as a “worker-peasant-soldier” student at Tsinghua University on a programme that enrolled students not on academic merit but class background. These years left him with a sense of threat and insecurity that would last his entire life, and manifest in his policies once he achieved ultimate power, analysts say. “He was influenced by the environment in which he grew up and the indoctrination he imbibed in his teenage years,” said Chen Daoyin, a former associate professor at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “In his youth, he was always in an insecure position … He was psychologically vulnerable.” A former victim of political struggles, the elder Xi had lobbied for a law to protect the freedom to express political opinions. But the younger Xi was shaped by Maoist propaganda and brutal party politics, analysts say. “His father was a liberal, but he went to jail. To avoid his father’s fate, Xi learned to do things in an opposite fashion,” said Willy Lam, a veteran China watcher. Protecting the party and consolidating power The turmoil of that time traumatised everyone who lived through it. After Mao’s death, China’s leaders concluded that power should never again be concentrated in the hands of a single man. They set up a system of collective leadership that lasted until Xi’s rule. Xi Jinping appears to have drawn almost the opposite conclusion and reverted to Mao’s ruling style. Both in his image and rhetoric, he emulates the late Great Leader. He has accumulated power, shored up the authority of the Communist party and cultivated a personality cult, as if personal strength and the system that once tormented him were China’s only bulwark against another descent into chaos. Under his decade-long rule, authorities have vastly expanded censorship and party controls on the economy, created a sprawling network of internment camps in western Xinjiang and have been accused of genocide for abuses including mass detentions and forced sterilisation. Across China they carried out the harshest crackdown on civil society since the bloody destruction of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. Human rights lawyers have been detained, jailed or disqualified, non-governmental organisations have been closed or forced to disband, media censorship tightened and outspoken journalists and activists jailed or silenced. “The lesson that Xi had learned was that by being a good and obedient communist, you could survive and even thrive, even if that meant forgetting the party’s treatment of his father,” said Prof Michel Bonnin, an expert on the Cultural Revolution at the Paris-based École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales. “It was better to be a good child of Chairman Mao than a rebel.” He never turned on the organisation that had presided over his early misery and loss, applying for party membership seven times. He was only granted it after his father’s political status had been downgraded from its Cultural Revolution extremes. Instead, after university he set out on an initially uneventful career as a young cadre, his path smoothed by his parents – who reportedly put in calls to his first boss in central China and then pulled strings to have him moved to coastal Fujian province. He spent the best part of two decades there, rising slowly but steadily through party ranks, from a peripheral district to provincial party chief, while commuting to Beijing to spend time with his glamorous second wife, the singer Peng Liyuan. Peng, whose elegant image helps boost China’s soft power abroad, once performed for the troops who cleared democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square. Xi was in Fujian when one of the biggest corruption scandals of recent decades came to light. Authorities raided the “red mansion”, where a wealthy businessman treated officials to food, drink and sex workers, in order to curry favour for his projects. Yet somehow he emerged personally unscathed. Instead, he may have taken away a heightened sense of how corruption was eroding public faith in the party, and how anti-corruption drives could be used to target political rivals. Purges have been a key instrument in his consolidation of power over the last decade, reaching to the very top of the party. When he was not yet 40, another traumatic upheaval sharpened Xi’s instinct for autocracy – this time a geopolitical collapse, rather than a national or personal crisis. The end of the Soviet Union in 1991, after Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempt at reforms, has haunted China’s Communist party. To Xi, the implosion of the party and system that inspired China’s own communists was a warning that political liberalisation and a lapse in ideological control would lead to disaster. He saw a political vulnerability that matched his personal insecurities. Soon after he came to power in late 2012 he told party cadres that they must study the collapse of their neighbour, and return to Leninist discipline. “In the end, just one blithe word from Gorbachev to declare the dissolution of the Soviet Communist party, and a great party was gone,” Xi reportedly said. “In the end, there was no real man who came out to resist.” It was a failure Xi was determined not to repeat. Yet while Xi has deftly consolidated power and removed obstacles to his rule, critics say he lacks intellectual grounding for leadership, even if “Xi Jinping Thought”, his contribution to the Chinese Communist canon, has been enshrined into the state constitution and is studied across China. He earned his PhD in Marxist theory and ideological and political education from Tsinghua University at a time when he was also governor of Fujian province, which is unlikely to have left much time to study, according to Cai Xia, a former professor at the party school who now lives in exile. “Why, unlike his predecessors, is Xi so resistant to others’ advice?” she wrote in a recent article for Foreign Affairs. “Part of the reason I suspect is that he suffers from an inferiority complex, knowing that he is poorly educated in comparison with other top CCP leaders.” His insecurities may have fuelled both paranoia and an aggression that makes it harder for him to reverse course on bad policy; his concentration of power has stifled dissent in the party that once helped thrash out ideas. A quest for total control Xi’s fear of the disintegration of the party and collapse of its rule translates into a quest for total control over everything, from the personal lives of individuals to China’s giant multinational firms, say analysts. “What strikes me most about Xi Jinping is his Stalinist way of governance, using his apparatus to purge the party, [emphasising] the party’s unified leadership and going back to the real party dictatorship,” said Jean-Philippe Béja, a research emeritus professor at Sciences Po in Paris. “No one is beyond the reach of the party.” Businesses that fuelled China’s extraordinary three decades of growth, from tech giants to tutoring companies, have in recent years found the party demanding either a stake or more oversight, installing officials and demanding party cells be set up. During Xi’s rule, the party has reached into the private sector and family lives in ways not seen since the start of the “reform and opening” era under Deng Xiaoping in 1978, meddling in details such as how much time young people can spend playing video games. The CCP’s love of control, and growing ability to monitor digital communication, has been thrown into relief by its handling of the Covid outbreak. The pandemic provided excuse and motivation to bring in an all-encompassing tracking of citizens’ lives and movements that analysts say is reminiscent of Mao-era totalitarian controls, but turbo-charged by modern technology. Xi this week said he remains committed to the zero-Covid policy of total elimination, even as the rest of the world opens up and learns to live with the virus. Like Stalin, Xi believes in party control by party institutions, making him “a more orthodox Marxist-Leninist leader than Mao”, said Bonnin. “The obvious problem is that the country might choke under such tight and rigid control.” He has upended foreign policy too, after decades of following Deng Xiaoping’s exhortation to keep a low profile – or “hide your light and bide your time”. Under Xi, China has seen rapid military expansion in the South China Sea, effectively taken control of Hong Kong, and ramped up threats against Taiwan. A cohort of aggressive “wolf warrior” foreign envoys, meanwhile, have cast aside diplomatic conventions. And in his third term there is no expectation that Xi’s ideology or principles will shift, even though he faces increasing headwinds. In Xi’s speech at the opening of the party congress on Sunday, he urged cadres to “dare to struggle” – using the word douzheng (“struggle”) that was widely used in the Mao era – and extolled “a fighting spirit” to defend national dignity and national interests amid a “turbulent” international situation. The economy is ailing amid greater state meddling and the fallout from Covid, there is domestic discontent over the handling of the pandemic, and tensions with the west have been rising for years over issues from trade to the treatment of Uyghurs. But if anything, political triumph is likely to cement Xi’s hardline instincts to protect a system that many “red princelings” like him see as both inheritance and mission. “In their eyes, the nation was fought for and won by their father’s generation,” said Song Yongyi, a US-based historian of the Cultural Revolution. “It belongs to them and their families.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T18:56:07Z","webTitle":"Centrica’s buyback is a heavy hint to Sunak about windfall tax | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/nov/10/centrica-buyback-is-hint-sunak-nuclear-windfall-taxes","fields":{"bodyText":"Back in July, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, tried to sound sheepish about reinstating its dividend at a penny a share at a moment when customers were braced for higher energy bills. The company accompanied its move with feelgood boasts about how it expected to pay £600m under Rishi Sunak’s three-year “energy profits levy” on North Sea oil and gas production. Four months later, there is less bashfulness. Earnings will be “towards the top end of the range” of analysts’ expectations, Thursday’s trading update said, and shareholders can have a much more significant distribution – a buyback of 5% of the share capital, which will cost roughly £250m. The shares rose 6%. Centrica, it seems, will live with the flak – and since its largesse is nothing compared with the oil majors’, you can understand the thinking. But Sunak, let’s hope, read Centrica’s update in detail. The North Sea fields and energy traders are still doing nicely (less so British Gas during warm weather) but an unspecified chunk of the forecast-beating returns are coming from electricity generation. That refers to Centrica’s 20% holding in the UK’s nuclear power stations, a part of the energy industry untouched by the North Sea-only windfall tax. Nuclear, though, is every bit as much of a cash cow currently. Its operating costs haven’t budged but, since the price of electricity is tied to the price of gas, revenues will be through the roof. The government has danced ineffectually around the generation sector for months, pondering price caps and voluntary negotiations to switch projects on to new-era “contracts for difference”, but no solution has yet appeared. It’s time to make a decision. If all the technocratic solutions are deemed to be too fiddly, then it has to be windfall levy. With nuclear, the case is particularly strong because there is no question of creating disincentives to future investment (the grumble from renewables developers). Any future nuclear plant, such as Sizewell C, would be funded by a bespoke financing and pricing model. Centrica, note, will have taken its share buyback decision in full knowledge that some form of levy is likely on nuclear’s windfall returns. And it still thinks it can afford £250m. Sunak should take the hint. Wolfson is right about foreign workers The last time Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, pleaded for the government to allow more foreign workers into the UK, he received a pile of abuse from a prime minister (Boris Johnson) who hadn’t bothered to understand his proposal. The leave-supporting Wolfson wasn’t – and still isn’t – advocating uncontrolled immigration. Rather, he wants a demand-led system that would incentivise UK businesses to hire local workers. Overseas recruits would have to be paid the same as local counterparts, and the employer would pay a 10% surcharge to the Treasury on the wages of foreign-hired labour. “It would automatically mean that businesses never bought someone into the company from outside if they could find someone in the UK,” he said in a BBC interview released on Thursday. “But if they genuinely can’t, they’ll pay the premium.” Last time around, Johnson launched a kneejerk Brexit refrain about British business being addicted to cheap foreign labour, which completely missed the point. A question now, then, is whether the latest inhabitants of Downing Street will engage with the real issue: the lack of flexibility in the UK’s labour market that plainly comes at a cost to growth. Under Liz Truss, there were nods of recognition. The deregulation part of her short-lived agenda contained a push to reform the shortage occupations list to cover, for instance, seasonal agricultural workers and broadband engineers. Where does Sunak stand? We’ll find out (possibly) in next week’s autumn statement, but business lobbyists suspect he’ll be in the Johnson camp. They anticipate no pro-business measures on immigration. If so, it will be another missed opportunity. Wolfson is right that it’s time to move on from tired referendum-era arguments. Hospitals, pubs, restaurants and many other sectors are crying out for a pragmatic approach. His proposal offers a sensible way forward.

While Australia was yet to actually join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the shift in its voting position to “abstain” after five years of “no” is seen by campaigners as a sign of progress given the former Coalition government repeatedly sided with the United States against it. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said through a spokesperson that Australia had “a long and proud commitment to the global non-proliferation and disarmament regime” and that the government supported the new treaty’s “ambition of a world without nuclear weapons”. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup The previous Coalition government was firmly against the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a relatively new international agreement that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such activities. Australia voted against opening negotiations on the proposed new treaty in late 2016 and did not participate in those talks in 2017. Since 2018 it has voted against annual resolutions at the UN general assembly and first committee that called on all countries to join the agreement “at the earliest possible date”. That changed early on Saturday morning when Australia shifted its voting position to abstain. Indonesia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Ireland were among countries to co-sponsor this year’s supportive UN resolution. Australia traditionally argued the treaty would not work because none of the nuclear weapons states had joined and because it “ignores the realities of the global security environment”. It also argued joining would breach the US alliance obligations, with Australia relying on American nuclear forces to deter any nuclear attack on Australia. But the treaty has gained momentum because of increasing dissatisfaction among activists and non-nuclear states about the outlook for disarmament, given that nuclear weapons states such as the US, Russia and China are in the process of modernising their arsenals. The treaty currently has 91 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it, and it entered into force last year. The Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) had been urging Australia to vote in favour of the UN resolution on Saturday – or at least abstain in order to “end five years of opposition to the TPNW under the previous government”. Three in four members of the Labor caucus – including Anthony Albanese – have signed an Ican pledge that commits parliamentarians “to work for the signature and ratification of this landmark treaty by our respective countries”. Labor’s 2021 national platform committed the party to signing and ratifying the treaty “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support. These conditions suggest the barriers to actually signing may still be high. But Gem Romuld, the Australia director of Ican, said the government was “heading in the right direction” and engaging positively with the treaty. Romuld said it “would be completely self-defeating to wait for all nuclear-armed states to get on board” before Australia joined. “Indeed, no disarmament treaty has achieved universal support and Australia has joined all the other disarmament treaties, even where our ally – the US – has not yet signed on, such as the landmine ban treaty,” Romuld said. In 2017 the US, the UK and France declared that they “do not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party” to the new treaty, and the Trump administration actively lobbied countries to withdraw. Wong told the UN general assembly last month that Australia would “redouble our efforts” towards disarmament because Russian president Vladimir Putin’s “weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","type":"interactive","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T04:34:40Z","webTitle":"Nuclear subs, tax cuts, or money to raise the jobseeker rate – how would you spend Australian tax dollars?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/mar/15/nuclear-subs-tax-cuts-or-money-to-raise-the-jobseeker-rate-how-would-you-spend-it","fields":{"bodyText":"Government spending is always contentious, with every choice made being highly political.

The Nationals leader proposes making the grocery code of conduct compulsory, boosting penalties to a “punitive” $10m maximum and adding powers to break up grocery giants in the event of misconduct. In an interview marking one year of the Albanese government, Littleproud told the Guardian’s Australian Politics podcast that the Nationals are a “sovereign party” that will “do our own thing”. Littleproud revealed he has had “initial talks” with the assistant minister for competition, Andrew Leigh, about competition law reforms that the Coalition “were moving to [in government] but were too slow”. “The Nationals wanted to move at a lot quicker pace in terms of a compulsory grocery code. The current penalty on breaching the grocery code, which is voluntary for our big supermarkets, is about $64,000 … That’s a cost of doing business. “Let’s have punitive penalties there, $10m plus divesture powers.

That is a market imbalance and even the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] say that. On Friday, Coles’ supermarkets announced total group sales in the third quarter grew 6.5 per cent to $9.7 billion, with supermarket sales up 7.0 per cent to $8.6b and liquor sales rising 2.6 per cent to $801m. Outgoing CEO Steven Cain attributed the success to Coles’ home brand range, Flybuys points program and weekly special deals. Littleproud said the Nationals would like to work with the government to protect small business. “So I think there’s some reforms there that the Nationals would like to work with the government, to say let’s shift the dial on this, let’s protect small business against big supermarkets. “And it’s only regulatory. So if they’re doing the right thing, Coles, Woolies and Aldi shouldn’t care one iota. “The small supplier and particularly farmers are getting done over and this is where they just need protection. They’re not asking for charity, they’re just asking for a fair price that’s transparent to their cost of production and what it is to get on on to … their shelves and on to your plate.” On Friday the former competition watchdog head Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the big supermarkets have likely used their market power to increase prices higher than necessary during a cost-of-living crisis and that the government should consider reforming merger laws to limit their dominance. Leigh said he “[welcomed] bipartisanship in this important area of competition policy” after a decade in which the Coalition presided over “the worst productivity growth in the postwar era”. “As I’ve highlighted in a series of recent speeches, Australia’s economy has become increasingly dominated by a handful of big players,” he said. “Since coming to office, Labor has increased penalties for anti-competitive conduct and banned unfair contract terms. “We’re consulting on banning unfair trading practices and tackling anti-competitive behaviour in specific sectors. We’re also in the process of reviewing the effectiveness of the dispute resolution mechanisms under the grocery code of conduct.” In a wide-ranging interview, Littleproud said at the 2022 election the Nationals had “lost a lot of voters, and particularly in the cohort of 18- to 54-year-old women and young people”. Littleproud suggested the Nationals could re-engage with these voters by advocating for childcare accessibility, regional health, and committing that “we are serious about net zero and about how we achieve it”. Littleproud echoed opposition leader Peter Dutton’s call for an investigation of small-scale modular nuclear power to help firm electricity from renewables, which the Albanese government has ruled out on cost and feasibility grounds. Littleproud defended the Nationals’ decision to come out in November in opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament in the constitution. In contrast to Dutton’s claims that the voice proposal lacked detail, Littleproud said “the detail has been there for some time about the principle that the prime minister would be putting to the Australian people”. Littleproud argued that Australia doesn’t “need a bigger bureaucracy, you just need a better one” to help narrow the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in health and social outcomes. “The thing that I’m most disappointed in all this is that there is no ambitious goal to say, as a nation, that we will have closed the gap by 2030, 2035.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-14T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"A key lesson from the Niger crisis: Africans, not global powers, will plot the continent’s path","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/14/niger-crisis-africans-continent-moscow-washington","fields":{"bodyText":"A “coup belt” now extends across the African continent, running along the Sahel region that bisects north and sub-Saharan Africa. On 10 August, Niger, where the democratically elected president was deposed by a military junta, became the last link that completed the corridor of countries run by coupsters. It is the ninth coup or attempted power grab in west and central Africa since 2020. This might appear at first glance as a retrenchment, the thrusting of African countries back into military rule and weak democratic cultures, with a dash of Russian mischief to complete the picture of a fragile region at the whim of local strongmen and meddling. The reality is much more complicated, and perhaps even oddly hopeful. Let’s first address that which is not entirely true. Much has been made of Russian intervention in the region, primarily through the activities of the Wagner group. Wagner, in terms of troop deployment, is indeed present in Africa, but only concentrated in a few countries: Central African Republic, Mali and Libya. The rest of Wagner’s active military presence is fluid and inconsistent in loyalty, as mercenary deployment often is: providing support, arms and training to governments and insurgencies alike. The organisation’s main concern appears to be a sort of economic piracy, forging partnerships with local militias and governments to extract and skim off the yield of natural resources: gold in Sudan, oil in Libya, diamonds and uranium in Central African Republic. To achieve these ends, Wagner deploys not just firepower and manpower, but nestles within the soft power of the Russian state. All Eyes on Wagner, a project that tracks the outfit’s activities through open source information and witness accounts, told me that Wagner is assisted by the Russian non-profit organisation the Foundation for National Values Protection, which claims to monitor perceptions of government among the citizenry so as to better shape and “get a feel” for what works in certain countries. The result is that Wagner is skilled in the sort of propaganda and targeted local outreach that portrays it as the representative of benign foreign powers, a contrast to the US and ex-colonial European forces. “A gift from Yevgeny Prigozhin” is how food parcels of rice, sugar and lentils distributed to poor people are labelled. Two weeks ago, Putin proposed to liberate African countries from neocolonialism. In Niger, pro-coup demonstrators assembled waving Russian flags and chanting “down with France”. This is not to understate Wagner’s and by extension Russia’s influence, but these are enablers, rather than causes, of the spate of coups since 2020. And their presence galvanises US attention and diplomatic scrambling, further establishing the impression that these coups are somehow proxy skirmishes for power on the part of foreign regimes, obscuring the real dynamics on the ground. That perspective of Africa as merely a weak link in the global security chain has also overemphasised Islamic terrorism in the Sahel as a contributing factor. The presence of jihadist groups in the region has historically elicited a classically narrow militarised response from western powers that have deployed troops in Niger and greater west Africa. But this provides no solution for, or understanding of, the fact that increased terrorist activity, like the coups themselves, is a symptom of demographic and economic trends across the region rather than a primary trigger for democratic instability. Which brings us to the varied reasons behind these coups. Unsettling as they are to foreign interests, they are, for the most part, hyperlocal and a long time coming. Weak states, strong military and paramilitary forces, the climate crisis that has disrupted ways of living and a demographic bulge that has resulted in large populations of young people with poor economic prospects, all combine to empower government takeover and sow widespread despair and a sense of loss of agency that young, charismatic strongmen can exploit. It is easy to collapse these reasons into the fatalistic conclusion that parts of Africa that share these patterns are simply condemned to cycles of violence. But often these structural problems sit alongside homegrown efforts to build and nurture democracy that endure, despite the challenges. Niger itself was a good news story, with its now deposed president coming to power in a democratic election in 2021 that was Niger’s first peaceful transition of power since independence, one that successfully saw off a coup attempt before the president took office. In Sudan, on the far east of the coup belt, a popular uprising against Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year dictatorship agitated so hard for civilian governance that a 2021 coup was launched to forestall that popular demand and proceeded to cut off Sudan from the rest of the world and hobble its economy, before plunging the country into war between different military factions. The result is the hopeful prospect, even though it may not seem like it, of coups no longer being allowed to pass as business as usual on the continent. There is a realisation among heads of state and regional organisations that democratic governments must be encouraged – the normalisation of overthrowing democratically elected governments by force creates a contagion effect and is disruptive to all of the continent’s prospects. As it stands, the airspace of Libya in the north of Africa, Niger in the west and Sudan in the east is closed to commercial flights, creating a triangle that cargo and passenger traffic must thread. Over the past three months, air traffic into Africa from Europe has been forced to recalibrate flight paths twice, as countries became unsafe to fly over. The stakes are high, no longer just when it comes to security, but economic stability. The outcome of these continent-wide risks is that the Niger coup has drawn a response from Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States), which is unprecedented. The organisation has threatened military action if the coup is not reversed. A meeting to thrash out details of that on Saturday was cancelled. But the threat, and the resolutely strong censure, remain. Last week, after the coupsters refused to stand down, hoping that Ecowas would blink first, west African leaders activated standby forces, with President Bola Tinubu of Nigeria warning that “no option is taken off the tables”. “If we don’t do it,” he said, “no one else will do it for us” – a clear-eyed declaration that Moscow, Washington, Paris and London have nothing to offer African countries and that their concerns for democracy ring hollow as they do little but pursue narrow interests in the region. It is “an unavoidable reality”, writes veteran Africa correspondent Howard French, that “Africans will ultimately make or break their continent’s geopolitical landscape – and foreign interlopers, however muscle-bound they may appear, are ultimately fated to play a secondary role.” Amid stale cold war framings, western military calculations about jihadist contagion and fretting about loss of influence on the part of ex-colonial powers, Niger’s coup and those that preceded it may in fact plot a path to a future in which it finally becomes clear that Africa’s stability will not be forged in the Pentagon or on heated analysis panels on cable news, but on its own terms and through its own mechanisms, once it faces its worst fears and opts for self-preservation.

Now the film is contending with more darts. Sir Michael Caine is furious at the news that Zulu, the 1964 film about the battle of Rorke’s Drift that made him an international star, has been named as something that could encourage far-right sympathies by the Research Information and Communications Unit, run as part of Prevent, the government’s counter-terror operation. As if to troll Sir Michael and everyone else, the unit includes on its list The Four Feathers, The Great Escape and The Dam Busters – the last one perhaps because of the name that Wing Commander Guy Gibson gives his dog. (To quote the explanation given by David Brent, “it was before racism was bad”.) But the list also includes works by Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Tennyson, Kipling and Edmund Burke as well as The Thick of It, Yes Minister and Michael Portillo’s Great British Railway Journeys. (Maybe we’ll let them have that last one.) But is Prevent really trying to get Zulu and all these other texts cancelled? Or is it merely recording the (perhaps mischievous) way that far-right groups solemnly invoke these things as touchstones? And could it be that Prevent’s clumsy list will cause people to watch Zulu all over again, to get a new generation to see Stanley Baker, that lion of British cinema who played Caine’s commanding officer Lt John Chard, and of course Caine himself, playing a stiff-upper-lipped posh type for the first and last time in his life? There is also Jack Hawkins as the alcoholic civilian missionary who is evacuated in a truck screaming: “You’re all going to die! Don’t you realise? Can’t you see?” It’s certainly a tricky watch, with the concept of empire now being re-examined. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift happened during the Anglo-Zulu War, caused by Britain’s invasion of Zululand in 1879. The combatants’ manpower on both sides might be said to have been about equal but the British had the cannons, breechloading rifles and Gatling guns. The Zulus were defending an unprovoked attack on their territory by an invader with superior weaponry. But the film Zulu claimed underdog status for the British by focussing on a specific event in which just 150 British soldiers held off around 4,000 Zulu warriors. The movie sentimentally imagines a final standoff in which the British and Zulus actually sing to each other, imbued with respect for each other’s martial gallantry: the Zulus a funeral lament and the British a chorus of Men of Harlech. Did director Cy Endfield consider a game of football between them on no man’s land? The movie doesn’t exactly provide the overall context: this was part of a catastrophic reverse for the British, taking into account the previous Battle of Isandlwana – to which Rorke’s Drift was a footnote – in which they were defeated despite their weaponry advantage. After Rorke’s Drift, moreover, some Zulus were hanged using a specially constructed gallows. The movie is arguably part of the cover-up mythology that began almost immediately: the seizing on and inflation of a relatively unimportant event. Undoubtedly the look and feel of Zulu inspired a film that does not feature on the Prevent list: Carry On Up the Khyber, that well-known satire of British colonialism. Perhaps the Research Information and Communications Unit could host a double-bill of these films at the Home Office."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T17:41:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 188 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were shelling ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow was using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces had taken back four villages near Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main target being Kherson. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fire in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply. Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russia officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have been reported to have failed in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another vessel carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team would visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the UN nuclear watchdog inspectors to reach the Zaporizhzhia plant. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the IAEA mission through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Zaporizhzhia plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventive safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counterproductive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to punish Russia for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed the French utility company Engie that it is reducing its gas deliveries owing to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in the war, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it was likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase in size by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting from January next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-24T08:28:11Z","webTitle":"New Icac powers spark concerns as NSW opposition flags move to stop ‘reckless’ change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/24/new-icac-powers-spark-concerns-as-nsw-opposition-flags-move-to-stop-reckless-change","fields":{"bodyText":"Special powers handed to the New South Wales corruption watchdog to use illegally obtained recordings have been described as “concerning”, with the opposition and members of the crossbench vowing to try to stop them from proceeding. The government granted the powers to the Independent Commission Against Corruption on Wednesday to assist it with an ongoing investigation in response to a request from its chief commissioner, John Hatzistergos. A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed the request was made after the commission found illegal recordings as part of its investigation into the Sydney developer and fugitive Jean Nassif, his company Toplace and branch stacking. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, said on Thursday he would work to stop or change the powers to ensure they could apply to just the one Icac investigation. “This is reckless drafting. It should have been subject to proper scrutiny of parliament where we could have finessed the drafting … but this hasn’t been done,” he said. “You have an Icac and a government that have made this reckless and outrageous and outlandish and over-the-top power grab.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The former supreme court judge Anthony Whealy KC said the powers should be used sparingly and transparently. “As a one-off, it’s tolerable, but the idea that authorities can get access to illegally obtained intercepts is rather concerning,” he said. “The power has been exercised or is about to be exercised transparently. That is, at least we all know that this power has been specially conferred, so that’s a good thing. “I would like to see it used only sparingly and in exceptional cases.” Whealy, who also serves as the chair for the Centre for Public Integrity, said there would likely be problems if a matter was referred from Icac to the director of public prosecutions if the initial case involved illegally collected phone taps. “In a criminal prosecution, I think they’d be hard-pressed to get admitted into evidence,” he said. The Liberal Democrats upper house member, John Ruddick, will attempt to garner support from other MPs over the next two weeks to overturn the new power when parliament returns for its next sitting fortnight. “It will provide an incentive for people to take secret recordings of phone calls with … all sorts of enemies and hand them over to Icac and this is appalling. “I’d be prepared to pay the cost of having a few criminals going free for the rest of us to have more civil liberties.” Ruddick said it would “come down to the Greens” to achieve the simple majority required to block the new power. Hatzistergos wrote to the premier, Chris Minns, the special minister of state, John Graham, and the attorney general, Michael Daley, on 9 August. According to a statement by Graham and Daley, Hatzistergos’s letter “indicated” that Icac had obtained evidence that appeared to be recordings of private conversations made by a third party. “In his letter, the chief commissioner advised that the Icac wishes to lawfully obtain, possess, publish and communicate the recordings and reports of the recordings as part of an ongoing investigation,” the statement read. The government has given Icac an exemption through a regulatory change, which is different to legislation in that it did not require the majority support of parliament to be enacted. The powers will automatically be revoked at the end of 2025."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T18:59:25Z","webTitle":"Howard ministers considered extinguishing native title over SA site earmarked for nuclear waste dump","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/01/howard-ministers-considered-extinguishing-native-title-over-sa-site-earmarked-for-nuclear-waste-dump","fields":{"bodyText":"John Howard’s government considered extinguishing native title over a South Australian site earmarked for a nuclear waste dump “by agreement or by compulsory acquisition”, the 2002 cabinet papers reveal. The records, released on Sunday by the National Archives of Australia, shed light on the Howard government’s part in the decades-long battle to create a national storage site for Australia’s low- and medium-level nuclear waste. The Keating government began searching for a site to store the nation’s nuclear waste as early as 1992. In 2012 the Gillard government passed a controversial bill to create the nation’s first nuclear waste dump – saying it hadn’t yet decided on a location, although many believed it was destined for remote Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Now preliminary works have started on a site at Napandee, near Kimba in South Australia, after the Morrison government resources minister Keith Pitt declared native title had been extinguished there. The legal and political obstacles were apparent in 2002 when the finance minister, Nick Minchin, and science minister, Peter McGauran, brought their submission to cabinet. They proposed that federal laws should be used to override SA laws that would ban the establishment of a dump, and that Indigenous land use agreements could be used to override native title. If native title parties had not “agreed to the surrender of their native title through an ILUA”, the government should consider compulsory acquisition, they said. Cabinet noted that “the extinguishing of native title, whether by agreement or by compulsory acquisition, is likely to raise difficult issues”. The cabinet submission noted there were “strong imperatives” for “the safe keeping of hazardous radioactive waste materials” that arise from medicine, industry and research. The waste is now stored at Lucas Heights outside Sydney, and more than 100 institutions across the country. “Given the sensitivity of the project and the need for certainty of tenure that provides exclusive use of the site for the duration of the project, there appears to be no practical alternative to the extinguishment of native title,” the submission said. But the government would need to provide “benefits” in return, and be prepared for legal challenges. The submission also suggested a media strategy, saying that ruling out having intermediate waste (leaving just low-level waste) would “deprive the SA government of the argument the national repository was the thin end of the wedge, and that the government has a hidden agenda to site the national intermediate waste store in the state”. The current government plan is to use the Napandee site as permanent storage for low-level waste, and temporary storage for intermediate-level waste (the long-term plan for the intermediate waste is not clear). The prime minister’s department agreed with the 2002 plan, while the Attorney General’s Department supported it, but said there was not enough information to work out whether “security measures will be sufficient to prevent access to the repository for the purpose of terrorist or other criminal activity”. The Department of Foreign Affairs warned of the “distinct” possibility of “dirty bombs”, in the wake of the September 11 attacks. A dirty bomb is where an explosive is used to scatter radioactive dust. The Department of Defence had “serious concerns” about the initial proposal to use Woomera for storage. “A principal concern is the risk of a weapon impact on the national repository as well as the negative publicity that would result,” the department said. The traditional owners of the Napandee site, the Barngarla people, are still fighting the federal government in court. The SA premier, Peter Malinauskas, has said he supports their cause. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, has said the waste “cannot continue to build up”, and has committed to working with the Barngarla people to protect the site’s cultural heritage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T08:45:00Z","webTitle":"Best podcasts of the week: Trans moshpits, non-binary emo and the power of music for queer lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/25/hear-here-sounds-gay-podcast","fields":{"bodyText":"Picks of the week Dinner’s on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson Widely available, episodes weekly In this lofi podcast, the Modern Family star uses his contacts to bag freebie meals in New York and LA for a new guest each week.

This long-running podcast from siblings Alex and Christine Schiefer pays hilarious tribute to the niche world of one-star reviews, providing dramatic readings of everything from screeds against suburban branches of Hooters restaurants in the US to dud strands of weed, caves, matchmaking services, and wedding chapels. It is as much an exploration into the psyche of the people who feel compelled to leave reviews as it is an unearthing of the unusual places and things they experience. Centuries of Sound Since sound recording began in the 19th century, sonic traces of our history have ranged from changing styles of music to recorded speeches, radio broadcasts and the simple bustle of background noise. British sound artist James Errington has been compiling this audio archive since starting his podcast in 2017, making immersive sound mixes of music, chatter and atmosphere for each year from the 1850s onwards. While discursive interludes provide context for the mixes, the audio itself is an engrossing guide, placing listeners directly back in the time of the music and sound’s making. The Pen Addict We might spend most of our lives glued to screens and tapping at keyboards, but there is still a satisfying pleasure in putting pen to paper and scratching away. At least, that’s the premise for this stationery-themed podcast, hosted by aficionados Brad Dowdy and Myke Hurley. The pair guide listeners through the latest developments in fountain pen technology, paper stock and ballpoint design in each episode. While it might sound yawn-inducing, the show’s attention to detail is strangely fascinating; from the rarefied world of collectors to what your handwriting says about you, there’s more to our writing implements than meets the eye. The Thing About Austen A historical podcast with an ingenious route into its 18th- and 19th-century periods of study, this series from literary academics Zan Cammack and Diane Neu examines the world that surrounded the novels written by Jane Austen (pictured above). Much more than just an exploration of genteel society and marriage comedies, Cammack and Neu’s wide-ranging and gleefully nerdy discussions drill down into the smallest details from Austen’s popular texts, from Sense and Sensibility’s toothpick cases to Northanger Abbey’s muslin. By raking through Austen’s objects, Cammack and Neu discover the writer’s ingenuity and what her characters’ possessions ultimately reveal about their time and place.

The orchestra’s tribute to the great composer, who died 11 months ago, was generous and sincere – a concert conducted by Martyn Brabbins that included both the first and last of the large-scale ensemble works that the Sinfonietta introduced, and which also involved musicians from the Manson Ensemble of the Royal Academy of Music, where Birtwistle studied clarinet in the late 1950s, a connection that he renewed at the end of his life. And, with the news of the sudden death three days earlier of Nicholas Snowman, co-founder of the Sinfonietta, who was a close friend of Birtwistle and a steadfast champion of his music, the occasion had taken on an extra poignancy. Snowman in fact commissioned the earliest piece in this programme, Verses for Ensembles, which the Sinfonietta first performed in 1969. With its block-like construction, raw, uncompromising soundworld of wind instruments and percussion, and mysterious elements of ritual as the instrumentalists move around the platform, Verses remains in many respects the archetypal Birtwistle score, and, as Brabbins’s performance showed, it has lost none of its excoriating power, derived in large part from its debts to Stravinsky and Varèse. Birtwistle observed that he always felt he was composing the same piece, exploring different facets in turn of one block of musical material, but how his music evolved was shown by the ensemble piece here from the other end of his career, In Broken Images, from 2011. The musical blocks by then have smoother edges, their rawness is tempered by a group of strings, and the argument is less static, more in a continuous process of development, while its rhetorical power remains intact. On occasions like this, one always wants to hear more pieces than a single concert can contain, but it seemed a pity that the programme began with a couple of miniatures, the “conversation for two instruments” Duet 1, and Virelai, an arrangement of a 14th-century work by Johannes Ciconia, rather than a more muscular piece. There was room however for one of Birtwistle’s most beautiful scores, The Fields of Sorrow, a setting of a brief Latin text by Ausonius for two sopranos (Abigail Sinclair and Lisa Dafydd) and chamber choir (Londinium), with two pianos and the inevitable wind instruments creating fragile, mysterious textures around them. Here, between the more strident pieces, were a few minutes of perfect tranquillity. This article was amended on 9 March. The word ‘fulsome’ was changed to ‘generous’."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T16:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘It is one minute before midnight’: the view from Germany’s industrial heartland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","fields":{"bodyText":"The winding route through the German countryside from Stuttgart to the small town of Mulfingen gives few clues that this south-west region is home to several companies that are global market leaders in their field. But north-east Baden-Württemberg boasts several successful specialist firms which make up the Mittelstand, the base of small and medium-sized engineering businesses that are the backbone of the German economy and are envied around the world. The fan and ventilator manufacturer ebm-papst is still headquartered in Mulfingen – a town with a population of about 3,600 – but its products are found all over the world in cars, household appliances and datacentres. However, the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, combined with labour shortages and post-pandemic disruption to supply chains, is piling pressure on these businesses, which are traditionally family-owned – and without the deep pockets enjoyed by Germany’s corporate giants. With Germany braced for recession this year, how this industrial heartland responds and adapts to the multiple crises will help shape not just the country’s future but wider eurozone, too. Germany is forecast to be the third worst-performing G20 country (-0.3%) this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Russia and the UK. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of Germany’s economy, more than double 9% seen in the UK and France, and well ahead of Italy’s 15%. The biggest industrial employer in the region, about 4,000 work for ebm-papst in Mulfingen, the majority producing fans and motors for ventilation, refrigeration and air-conditioning technology. Founded in 1963 by Gerhard Sturm, the company, which calls itself a “hidden champion”, remains family-owned but has been run for the last year by the chief executive, Klaus Geißdörfer. Under his leadership, the company decided to end the production of fans for cars. Instead it has switched staff to focus on new technologies, such as making ventilators for heat pumps and fans to cool datacentres. “We said that we’d better focus on the things where we really are the best in the world,” says Geißdörfer from his office at ebm-papst’s headquarters. “We decided to significantly increase our capacities, which we will ramp up next year, because at the moment we are not able to follow demand.” Despite profiting from booming sales in fans for renewable technologies, the past few years have not been plain sailing for ebm-papst. Covid lockdowns in China and the resulting supply chain disruption occasionally brought its German production lines to a halt, which Geißdörfer says “makes no sense”. As a result, the company has worked to source more parts locally, close to its big factories in Germany, as well as in the US and China. Just down the road in this economic heartland are the headquarters of the almost 80-year-old screw and fastener maker Würth, which sits near Bürkert, a manufacturer of measurement and control systems for liquids and gases. These companies have helped south Germany become an industrial powerhouse, bringing prosperity and a sense of local pride to the area. “The region has lots of world market leaders,” says Donata Lell, who runs a local guesthouse and restaurant. She believes the industrial base boosts her customers’ spending power: “People here earn more money.” Geißdörfer, who hails from neighbouring Bavaria, is convinced the small community of Mulfingen is a good place to run a manufacturing business. “We have smart people here. I like the spirit people have here, they are very enthusiastic,” he says. But does the company have enough of those people for it to meet growing demand? Despite Geißdörfer’s positivity, ebm-papst has difficulties finding staff with the right skills, as well as problems getting hold of components, such as semiconductors. Ebm-papst has tried to solve its worker shortage by offering some remote working to staff in administrative roles, plus free bus travel to work for employees who live within a 40km (25 mile) radius, a perk currently used by about 1,500 people. Amid the company’s cost pressures, and higher prices demanded by its suppliers, staff say they are struggling with the cost of living crisis. Employees on the factory floor have raised their personal financial difficulties directly with Geißdörfer. “I had people coming to me and saying ‘I cannot buy any Christmas presents for my children any more’,” he says. “I talk to people, and they say, ‘I cannot afford vacations any more’.” During the summer the company paid staff an extra €2,500 in cost of living payments, made in five monthly €500 instalments from October onwards. “We stay close together with our people, and we support them in tough times and we go through crises together and try to find a way to handle it,” Geißdörfer says, describing this as a strength of the Mittelstand. “That’s the positive thing with this kind of family business structure we have in Germany. I see also other companies doing similar things.” Yet that might not be enough. The IG Metall metalworkers’ trade union, the country’s largest, already represents workers at ebm-papst’s other manufacturing sites in Germany, but not at its main site in Mulfingen, as a result of a historic work agreement. It is working to get its foot in the door there too, says Uwe Bauer, IG Metall’s representative for the Schwäbisch Hall region. Bauer says the union has recruited several hundred members in Mulfingen in recent months, as workers realise full employment locally has created “an employees’ market”. “Businesses have to rethink what to do about skilled workers,” Bauer says. “We get a lot of requests about which companies are bound by collective wage agreements. Wages play a role, but so do regular working hours,” Bauer says. Ebm-papst’s pay offer nationally is broadly in line with the collective wage agreement deal struck between IG Metall and employers in Baden-Württemberg in late November, although the workers in Mulfingen are not subject to this agreement. The pay deal, which sets the benchmark for wage increases for almost 4m metal and electrical sector workers across Germany, increases workers’ wages by 5.2% from June and 3.3% from May 2024. In addition, they will also receive a €3,000 “inflation bonus”, as the union calls it, which is tax-free and payable in two instalments in March 2023 and 2024. The agreement is generous by historical standards, but still drew some criticism for coming in below inflation, when the annual rate stood at 10% in November, according to official statistics. While pay matters are settled for now, sourcing parts remains a challenge amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips since the start of the pandemic. In the race to obtain these vital components, Mittelstand firms find themselves unable to compete financially with the country’s largest manufacturers, particularly carmakers. “As a company we can grow faster if we can get more semiconductors,” says Geißdörfer. “Somehow, we compete. But the industry is competing with the automotive industry, the solar industry and the renewable energy industry, and we all need the same kind of electronics.” The government should do more to support the country’s vital network of small and medium-sized companies, he says, particularly with soaring energy costs, which Geißdörfer believes are making European companies globally uncompetitive compared with Asian or American rivals. Recent falls in wholesale energy prices have offered only a glimmer of hope. “I really have worries about German smaller and mid-sized companies that heavily depend on energy. They have real problems at the moment to work to face those huge energy costs increases.” While he welcomes government support with energy bills, Geißdörfer and other Mittelstand bosses fear Berlin does not have a clear industrial strategy, particularly while it weans the country off cheap Russian gas. Angela Merkel’s government’s decision to turn off its nuclear power plants after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan has left it exposed to the Kremlin’s weaponisation of gas. “In Germany, we need to reinvent ourselves,” says Geißdörfer, acknowledging the geopolitical challenges, including the energy transition, and Brexit. “We are still strong enough to have sufficient money and we can afford it, but we need to do this fast, to think about how to have a stable economy going forward. But it is one minute before midnight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-14T04:55:31Z","webTitle":"What is the Aukus submarine deal and what does it mean? – the key facts ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/14/what-is-the-aukus-submarine-deal-and-what-does-it-mean-the-key-facts","fields":{"bodyText":"In a tripartite deal with the US and the UK, Australia has unveiled a plan to acquire a fleet of up to eight nuclear-powered submarines, forecast to cost up to $368bn between now and the mid-2050s. Australia will spend $9bn over the next four years. From this year Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with US and UK navies, including within both countries’ submarine industrial bases. From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate their nuclear-powered submarines through HMAS Stirling near Perth as part of a push to step up training of Australians. The imperative Increased Chinese naval power and assertiveness – particularly in the South China Sea – has convinced the Australian government that it requires submarines capable of operating far from home bases, both as a deterrent and for attack capability in the event of a crisis. The current fleet of Collins class conventional submarines are expected to lose their edge from the 2030s. Nuclear-powered submarines have a distinct advantage over the diesel-electric boats of Australia’s fleet because they don’t need to surface to “snort” to recharge their batteries. Nuclear subs can leave port and stay underwater for weeks, avoiding detection. Four phases 1. Embedded personnel and port visits: Australian military and civilian personnel will embed with the the allies’ navies. US nuclear-powered submarines will increase their visits to Australian ports, with Australian sailors joining US crews for training. 2. Submarine rotations: From 2027 the UK and the US plan to rotate one UK Astute class submarine and up to four US Virginia class submarines through HMAS Stirling. 3. Sale of US Virginia-class submarines: From the early 2030s – pending approval by Congress – the US intends to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines, with a potential option for two more if required. 4. SSN-Aukus: A combination of UK submarine design and US defence technology will contribute to the development of the new SSN-Aukus submarine – intended as the future attack submarine for both the UK and Australia. Both Australia and the UK intend to start building SSN-Aukus submarines in their domestic shipyards before the end of this decade. The first such boat may enter into UK service in the late 2030s, but the Australian navy will receive its first Australian-built SSN-Aukus submarine in the early 2040s. Australia will begin construction works on the shipyard required to build nuclear-powered submarines in Osborne, South Australia, this year. The US Joe Biden said the three nations stood at an “inflection point in history” argued that in “forging this new partnership, we’re showing again how democracies can deliver, how our own security and prosperity and not just for us, but for the entire world”. The US president stressed – repeatedly – that the submarines that will be part of the Aukus deal will be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed”. “Australia is a proud non-nuclear weapons state and it’s committed to stay that way. These boats will not have any nuclear weapons of any kind on them.” Australia Australia’s prime minister said the Aukus plan marked “a new chapter” in the relationship between Australia, the US and the UK. “The Aukus agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history,” Anthony Albanese said. Without directly naming China as a source of concern, Albanese said the plan reflected a shared determination to ensure all countries could “act in their sovereign interests free from coercion”. China China responded to the announcement by saying the nuclear submarine cooperation plan was “a blatant act that constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability in the region”. “The irony of Aukus is that two nuclear weapons states who claim to uphold the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard are transferring tons of weapons-grade enriched uranium to a non-nuclear-weapon state, clearly violating the object and purpose of the NPT [non-proliferation treaty],” China’s mission to the UN tweeted. Nuclear waste The nuclear reactors that will power the SSN-Aukus submarines will not be built in Australia. They will arrive from either the UK or US in a welded power unit and will not require refuelling during their expected lifetime. Australia has said it will not enrich uranium or reprocess any spent fuel from the submarines. But it has committed to managing all of the radioactive waste generated by the submarines within Australia. “This includes radioactive waste with lower levels of radioactivity generated by day-to-day submarine operations and maintenance,” a government fact sheet says. “And radioactive waste with higher levels of radioactivity, including spent fuel, which is produced when submarines are decommissioned at the end of their service life.” No decision has been made on the location yet. Nuclear non-proliferation concerns The Aukus scheme is the first time a provision in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty has been used to transfer fissile material and nuclear technology from a nuclear weapons state to a non-weapons state. Paragraph 14 allows fissile material utilised for non-explosive military use, like naval propulsion, to be exempt from inspections and monitoring by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It makes arms controls experts nervous because it sets a precedent that could be used by others to hide highly enriched uranium, or plutonium – the core of a nuclear weapon – from international oversight. James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said there was “real and concrete harm done” to the non-proliferation regime. “My fear was never that Australia would misuse that fuel, but that other countries would invoke Aukus as a precedent for removing nuclear fuel from safeguards.” The Winner of the 2017 Nobel peace prize, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Australia’s decision to buy and build nuclear-powered submarines was both a major proliferation risk and could be seen internationally as a precursor to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Ican urged Australia to sign the UN treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons: the ban Ican has championed and to which 68 states around the world are now a party. The Australian government counters that it has no intention of seeking nuclear weapons, and adds: “The nuclear fuel Australia receives cannot be used in nuclear weapons without further chemical processing, requiring facilities that Australia does not have and will not seek.” Jobs The Australian government estimates the nuclear submarine program will need 20,000 jobs over the next 30 years, within the ADF, the domestic ship-building industry and the public service. The government forecasts 8,500 will be directly employed in Australia’s building and servicing of the submarines, including scientists, engineers, project managers, construction workers, electricians, fitters and builders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:21:30Z","webTitle":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia appeared close to taking control of Bakhmut on Monday, although Ukraine said it continued to fight on in the south-west fringes of the city largely devastated by an intense year of deadly fighting. Hanna Mailar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine still controlled “certain facilities” in the Litak district, but reports said the defenders had lost control of the last of the remaining high-rises in the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukraine has switched its primary focus to engaging in limited counterattacks on the higher ground to the immediate north-west and south of the ruined city, which could be used to threaten the Russian attackers below. “The offensive potential of the enemy has been significantly reduced, huge losses have been inflicted on the enemy” Mailar said. She added: “We have gained time for certain actions, which will be discussed later.” Bakhmut was first shelled in May 2022 and Russian forces consistently targeted the mining city that had a pre-war population of about 70,000. Although not considered of particular strategic value, the city has acquired a high symbolic value for both sides in the conflict. The two sides fought building by building in the most intense fighting seen in Europe since the end of the second world war, with Russia taking a year to advance about 24km on the Bakhmut sector of the eastern Donbas, a front that has otherwise remained relatively static since last autumn. The effort was led by the Russian mercenary Wagner group, using seasoned veterans to command a large number of former prisoners. But experts question whether, as the battle draws to an end, Wagner can continue to fight further. The Institute of the Study of War said on Sunday night it believed Wagner’s offensive was likely to be at its culmination point and that “it is unlikely that Wagner will continue fighting beyond Bakhmut at its current depleted state”. Joe Biden, the US president, said at the G7 summit in Japan that Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, killed and wounded, in fighting for the city, higher than previous Ukrainian estimates of 70,000. Ukraine does not release casualty figures but it is believed to have lost tens of thousands in the protracted struggle. Wagner’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declared on Saturday that Bakhmut had fallen, filming himself at the city’s battered railway station a few kilometres behind the frontline. Other video footage showed Russian troops waving flags at the western edge of the city, although not in the Litak district still being fought over. At that point, Prigozhin announced Wagner forces would withdraw from the city by Thursday, leaving its defence to regular Russian troops, although it was unclear whether that was a firm declaration of intent, or a feint designed to lure Ukrainian forces back into attacking the city. Attacking forces are often considered at their most vulnerable when an advance culminates, usually due to combat exhaustion, and Ukraine has been hinting that it hopes to surround the invaders in the city by attacking to the north and south. But the Ukrainian counterattacks remain relatively limited so far, and the expectation is that Kyiv will soon launch a more significant assault as the weather improves, using about 12 brigades-worth of troops, many of which have been equipped with western tanks, fighting vehicles and artillery. Three civilians were killed and 14 injured across Ukraine in overnight shelling while the country’s air force said it had shot down four cruise missiles and 20 drones. But the air force spokesperson Yuri Inhat said Ukraine did not “have enough means” – air defences – to deal with high-speed ballistic missiles across the country. Ukraine said it had reconnected the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its external power supply after a brief outage that had left it reliant on emergency generators. Backup diesel generators were in use for a time at the site, to ensure nuclear fuel was kept cool and prevent a potential disaster. It is the seventh time during the war that the nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, has had to switch to backup power. Russian forces seized the plant early in the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T01:51:49Z","webTitle":"UN calls for demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/06/iaea-gravely-concerned-about-damaged-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, involving the withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and the agreement of Ukrainian forces not to move in. Guterres was addressing a UN security council session on Tuesday, at which he supported the recommendations put forward Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who led an inspection visit to the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant last week, and presented a report to the security council. The report confirmed the presence of Russian soldiers and military equipment at the plant, including army vehicles. “We are playing with fire and something very, very catastrophic could take place. This is why in our report, we are proposing the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone limited to the perimeter and the plant itself,” Grossi said. Guterres said that, as a first step, Russian and Ukrainian forces should cease all military operations around the plant. “As a second step, an agreement on a demilitarised perimeter should be secured,” he added. “Specifically, that will include the commitment by Russian forces to withdraw military personnel and equipment from that perimeter and the commitment by Ukrainian forces not to move in.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offered qualified support for Grossi’s proposal to create a demilitarised zone around the plant and asked for more detail on the plan. “If the content of this proposal is to demilitarise the territory of the nuclear power plant – and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster - then we can support such a demilitarised protection zone,” he said. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, blamed recent shelling of the plant on Ukraine and portrayed Russian forces as protecting the plant. He did not respond to the call for a security zone, a proposal Moscow has so far rejected. Nebenzya said he had not had time to read the IAEA report. The IAEA report presented on Tuesday said the agency was “gravely concerned” about the “unprecedented” situation at the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian technicians, and urged interim measures to prevent a nuclear disaster. The report came as a Russian colonel who served as the military commandant of the occupied Ukrainian city of Berdiansk was reported to have been killed in a car bombing, according to Russian state media reports. The car bomb reportedly exploded near the city administrative headquarters, which is being used as a Russian base. Photographs showed that the car used by the Russian military official, who has been identified as Col Artyom Bardin, was severely damaged in the attack, which took place close to midday. Initial reports indicated that Bardin died from his wounds. But Vladimir Rogov, the Russian-appointed administrative head of the Zaporizhzhia region, said in a Telegram post written just after 8.30pm on Tuesday that the colonel continued to “fight for his life”. “Thank God, information about the death of the commandant of Berdyansk Artyom Bardin is not confirmed. Despite severe injuries, explosive leg amputation and massive blood loss, he is alive. Doctors continue to fight for his life,” he said. Russian officials have alleged that Ukrainewas behind the attack. If true, it would be the most significant assassination yet of an official working for the occupational government of Russia in Ukraine. At least two Ukrainians collaborating with the Russian government were killed in suspected partisan attacks in August. In one case, the deputy head of the Russian-installed military administration was shot to death in his home in the city of Nova Kakhovka. In late August, a Ukrainian politician from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s party who had gone over to work with the Russians was killed in the Kherson region. Ukrainian staff were operating under constant high stress and pressure, especially with the limited staff available, the report said. “This is not sustainable and could lead to increased human error with implications for nuclear safety,” it added. Britain’s ambassador to the UN, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the security council the Zaporizhzhia staff were “no longer workers, but hostages being held at gunpoint.” Russian troops seized control of the site in early March and there have been repeated attacks in the vicinity, prompting fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have denied responsibility and the report did not ascribe blame for the damage its inspectors had discovered. The UN agency sent a 14-person team to the site last week, including its director general, Rafael Grossi, to assess the situation at the plant. At least two members of the team are to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility’s safety. “There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said. “This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone. “The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities.” The IAEA said that, during its inspection, its team “closely witnessed shelling in the vicinity of the power plant, in particular on 3 September when the team was instructed to evacuate to the ground level of the administrative building”. On the same day, the plant was disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line. “While the ongoing shelling has not yet triggered a nuclear emergency, it continues to represent a constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance,” the inspectors wrote. Areas damaged by shelling included a turbine lubrication oil tank and the roofs of various buildings such as one housing a spent fuel transporter vehicle. Grossi is expected to brief the UN security council in New York on his findings later on Tuesday. Earlier, blasts rang out and power was cut in Enerhodar, the city surrounding the plant, according to Dmytro Orlov, the Ukrainian mayor who operates from outside Russian-held territory. Moscow repeated its longstanding accusations that Ukrainian forces had been shelling the plant. Kyiv says it is Russia that has been staging such incidents, to undermine international support for Ukraine and as a possible pretext to cut the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and steal its output. On the battleground in the east of the country on Tuesday, three civilians were killed in Russian rocket attacks in the Kharkiv region, a senior official said. In the past week the focus of fighting has shifted to the south, where Ukraine has started a long-awaited counterattack to recapture territory seized early in the war. Ukrainian officials posted an image online of three soldiers raising Ukraine’s flag on a rooftop in Vysokopyllya, in the north of Kherson. If confirmed, it could mark perhaps the most strategic breakthrough on the battlefield in the counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T18:17:09Z","webTitle":"Biden denounces Putin’s nuclear threats as ‘reckless’ in UN address","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/joe-biden-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-un-general-assembly","fields":{"bodyText":"Joe Biden and allied leaders have reacted angrily to Vladimir Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons and pledged to maintain support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s partial mobilisation and planned annexation of more Ukrainian regions. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, also shrugged off Putin’s moves to escalate the war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counter-offensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil. “We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Zelenskiy said in a pre-recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly, which Russia had tried to stop but was overwhelmingly voted down by member states. “Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine … It wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilisation at home. We cannot agree to a delayed war because it will be even hotter than the war now.” Both Biden and Zelenskiy sought to deepen Russia’s isolation, on a day when North Korea said it would not supply ammunition to Russian forces. In his speech to the general assembly on Wednesday, Biden sought to unite the international community in the face of what he called “reckless” threats and “an extremely significant violation” of the UN charter. The US president was speaking hours after Putin announced Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war and warned that Moscow had “lots of weapons to reply” to what he claimed were western threats on its territory. A senior US administration official said the US would not lessen its commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself. The official said Putin’s latest actions were an “act of weakness” that showed his “desperation”. “This is another episode in what has been a series of episodes over the course of this war where Putin is trying to rattle his sabre trying to scare us off,” the senior official said. “He has not succeeded before – he won’t succeed now, but that doesn’t mean that we’re blind to the dynamics that could relate to escalation and that we weren’t thinking carefully through in close consultation with our allies and with Ukrainians how we would deal with that.” Biden portrayed the Russian leader and his “imperial ambitions” as a threat to the founding values of the UN, seeking to consolidate Ukraine’s global support and coax some developing countries away from their neutral stance, as Putin raised the stakes. “This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Wherever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should make your blood run cold,” Biden said. “Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.” In his speech, Zelenskiy reminded world leaders of the mass graves being exhumed in the recently liberated town of Izium as the general assembly gathered, saying that among the bodies was a man strangled with a rope, and another who had been castrated before the murder. The Ukrainian president said that was not the first of such atrocities. He told the global assembly: “Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?” As Zelenskiy was speaking, a rare bit of good news emerged from the conflict: a prisoner swap in which Russia released 215 Ukrainian soldiers – many of whom had fought a last stand in the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol in May – in exchange for 55 Russians and Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician and oligarch who had taken sides with the Russian invaders. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, thanked the Ukrainian government for including two US citizens among 10 foreign fighters it asked to be freed as part of the swap, and also thanked Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for facilitating the deal. The UK prime minister, Liz Truss, dismissed Putin’s threats, telling the UN assembly late on Wednesdy: “We have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures. “He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. This will not work.” Earlier on Wednesday, Putin had delivered a highly anticipated televised address to declare a “partial mobilisation”, which he claimed was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west, which he said wanted “to destroy our country” and was trying to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation that will apply to “those with previous military experience”. The announcement triggered an exodus of Russian men scrambling to avoid the draft. Air tickets rose in price and were soon sold out. Russian opposition groups called for nationwide anti-war street protests and by Wednesday evening, more than 1,300 people had been arrested at the demonstrations, according to the independent protest monitoring group OVD-Info. “Putin’s announcement of a partial mobilisation is an act of desperation,” the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Twitter. “Russia cannot win this criminal war. Putin has underestimated the situation from the outset – including the will to resist of Ukraine and the resolve shown by its friends.” Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there had been no perceived change in the deployment Russian nuclear forces. “The most important thing is to prevent that from happening, and that’s the reason why we have been so clear in our communications with Russia about the unprecedented consequences, about the fact that the nuclear war cannot be won by Russia,” Stoltenberg told Reuters. Putin’s announcement came a day after Russian-controlled regions in eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans to hold “referendums” this weekend on becoming part of Russia. In his speech, Putin gave support to those ballots in the parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia runder Russian control. He also delivered barely veiled nuclear threats against Nato, saying: “I want to remind you that our country also has various means of destruction, and for separate components and more modern than those of Nato countries and when the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, to protect Russia and our people, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal.” Putin added: “It’s not a bluff.” The Russian leader and his senior officials have made a string of similar nuclear threats since launching the invasion in February, in an effort to deter Nato countries from intervening. But in his UN speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to make clear the US and its allies would not be deterred from supporting Ukraine’s fight to defend its territory. “Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations charter, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force,” Biden said. “The Kremlin is organising a sham referendum to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the UN charter. This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. “Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime,” he said, adding that such “irresponsible nuclear threats” directly contradicted Russia’s international responsibilities and its agreement with a joint statement by nuclear weapons powers at the beginning of this year that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Seeking support from the developing world in what he framed as a contest between democracy and dictatorship, Biden offered US support for reform of the UN security council to make it more inclusive as well asbillion of dollars for global food security and efforts to curb disease. US officials have conceded that their focus on Ukraine has led some developing countries from the global south to feel that their concerns were being ignored in a great power showdown. In his speech on Wednesday, Biden sought to address those fears, pledging $2.9bn for food security this year, and $6bn for the global fund to fight Aids tuberculosis and malaria. He also threw US support behind a longstanding demand for a more inclusive and representative security council with more permanent and non-permanent members, including permanent seats for countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T16:53:35Z","webTitle":"The SNP was already clouded by failure – under Humza Yousaf it could lose power altogether | Dani Garavelli","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/27/snp-humza-yousaf-leader-scotland-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"So, in an SNP leadership contest that became a pitting of competence against progressive values, progressive values won out. Humza Yousaf – who has billed himself as the continuity candidate, the torchbearer for Nicola Sturgeon’s liberal agenda – came through in the end, although by a tighter margin than any new leader of a party would want. Those members for whom Kate Forbes’s views on sexual and LGBTQ+ equality were a red line – and who had pledged to tear up their membership cards if she was victorious – can breathe a sigh of relief. Ditto the wider central belt, left-of-the-party supporters, who had viewed the prospect of a fiscal and social lurch to the right with dismay. It’s true that with Yousaf there will be less immediate upheaval. As the “establishment” candidate, he already has the support of the majority of MSPs and ministers. He will find it easier than Forbes would have done to form a cabinet, and his election makes it unlikely the Greens will walk out of their powersharing deal, as they had already threatened to do if Forbes became first minister. But there are downsides to Yousaf’s victory, too, both for the party and the country. If there is one thing Forbes was right about, it is that “continuity won’t cut it”. Yousaf cannot just pick up where his predecessor left off. It was a growing recognition that the Salmond/Sturgeon era had run out of steam that led to her resignation. The divisions within the party, and the miasma of failure around it, have only increased as a result of a bitterly fought contest and a relentless succession of bad news stories, something that is evident in the tight result. Yousaf will take the helm with little of the goodwill that accompanied Sturgeon’s 2014 anointment. That she was able to unite such an ideologically disparate party was due in part to her popularity and control freak tendencies, and in part to a tacit agreement to “wheesht for indy” – that is, to suppress dissent in the service of the greater cause of independence. With no second referendum on the horizon, and Sturgeon out of the picture, the cork has popped off the bottle and will not be forced back in. Yousaf inherits a party where most of the big figures of the Sturgeon era – John Swinney, Jeane Freeman and chief executive, Peter Murrell – have departed, and one which faces a barrage of internal and external questions over its integrity and transparency. The clamour for answers has become louder in recent weeks, thanks to the Holyrood public audit committee’s damning report into the CalMac ferries scandal – which revealed the waste of taxpayers’ money running into the millions – and the revelation that the party had misled the media over a 30,000 drop in membership figures. And, of course, there is still the police probe into the £600,000 of funds said to have gone missing from the party’s accounts (the party has not responded to the allegation, due to the ongoing investigation). That Yousaf was at the heart of the SNP as its culture of complacency grew – that he either failed to notice or turned a blind eye to it – makes it harder for him to convincingly promise a reset. In addition, Yousaf’s competency for the top job is doubted even by some of those who voted for him. As justice secretary, he presided over the widely derided hate crime bill, and during his tenure as health secretary waiting times for hospital treatment soared. The crisis that has engulfed the NHS must be the new first minister’s top priority. But one might wonder how the man who was in charge of it as it declined is going to find new ideas and resources to fix it now. It is clear from his campaign that Yousaf understands the disappointment many supporters feel about the SNP’s failure to improve the lives of the marginalised. His openness to introducing new taxes for the wealthy is preferable to Forbes’s more conservative economic bent. And yet his pledge to hold a summit for anti-poverty groups has all the hallmarks of the same old, same old: setting up yet another talking shop instead of taking action. Meanwhile, his predisposition to fight the UK government on its section 35 obstruction of the SNP’s gender recognition reform bill may be exactly what the progressives who voted for him want; but it will also rekindle the divisions that helped force his predecessor’s exit. As for the opposition parties, they denigrated Sturgeon’s achievements during her final first minister’s questions last week. But they know the departure of such a formidable figure opens up fresh opportunities. One of the quirks of the contest was that many unionist activists and commentators seemed to be lobbying for Forbes, which suggests they thought a victory for her would most boost their own position. But the Greens would have been the likely beneficiaries of a mass exit of “woke” members, and Forbes might have proved a challenging adversary across the chamber. It is impossible yet to know if Scottish Labour will rise to the occasion and capitalise on the widening faultlines within the SNP. But it is worth noting that there are long-term supporters within the party who believe the best thing that could happen to it would be a term out of office; and that Yousaf as first minister might be the best way to achieve it.

This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates. It has been corrected to convey that geothermal resources are often found “near tectonic plate boundaries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-11T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"‘Her writing became a catalyst for my own’: the power of Sylvia Plath","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/feb/11/her-writing-became-a-catalyst-for-my-own-the-power-of-sylvia-plath","fields":{"bodyText":"A few years ago a friend sent me a photo of himself wearing a Sylvia Plath T-shirt. It was pale pink – the colour of the Smith College memorandum paper on which the poet drafted many of her poems – and printed with the iconic picture of Plath in side profile, wearing a white hairband. I thought it was the greatest thing I’d ever seen. I am one of countless poets who developed an obsession with Sylvia Plath after being introduced to her work as a teenager, and her writing became a catalyst for my own. I recited her poems out loud in my bedroom, just as I would sing along to my favourite songs. The poems’ cadences sank into me, the way Plath sank into my own personal mythology, long before any other writers did. Beyond the power of her work, what Sylvia Plath represented to me is still hard to understand. On a personal level I felt a kinship with her because we had both lost parents as children (she, her father at eight; me, my mother at seven). We had both received sharp, early lessons in the savagery of the world. Such lessons are, of course, not unusual. Most teenagers, despite their backgrounds, have a sense of this savagery. Perhaps that’s why Plath’s work so often hits home in those years, when one is beginning to reckon with life’s difficulties and work out how, if, one might harness them. Ariel, Plath’s final, posthumously published collection of poems, shows us how. Understandably, these poems have often been interpreted in the light, or shadow, of her oncoming death. Sylvia Plath died of suicide 60 years ago today, at the age of 30. The circumstances around her death have been described, fictionalised, analysed – sometimes sensitively, more often voyeuristically – in biographies, memoirs, films and literature. Posterity loves a tragic female artist, a tendency that Plath’s daughter Frieda Hughes rightly objected to in My Mother, a furious poem written in response to the 2003 film about her parents, Ted and Sylvia. Its final lines read: They think I should love it – Having her back again, they think I should give them my mother’s words To fill the mouth of their monster, Their Sylvia Suicide Doll, Who will walk and talk And die at will, And die, and die And forever be dying. A death, however tragic, is only a very small part of a life. There is in fact incredible vigour and energy in Plath’s poems. Despite the anguish that powered its writing, Ariel is full of bright, glittering images, “electrifyingly-colored sherbets”, flowers of astonishing redness, and its soundtrack is hoofbeats. I read these things as symbols of the poet’s irrepressible life force, not her illness. Plath’s most recent biographer, Heather Clark, sought to make the poet’s life, not her death, the driving force of her book. Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath, a title taken from Plath’s poem Stings, captures perfectly the reasons why we should remember her. “Comet” comes from an ancient Greek word meaning “long-haired star”, an image that calls to mind the ending of Plath’s Lady Lazarus, a poem about coming back from the dead: “Out of the ash / I rise with my red hair’. Stings uses the metaphor of a beehive and its queen bee to describe a kind of renaissance of the self. The poet writes: “They thought death was worth it, but I / Have a self to recover, a queen.” As we memorialise Sylvia Plath on the anniversary of her death, we should honour this spirit of resurrection – and recover a queen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T08:00:02Z","webTitle":"Canary Wharf offices and retail spaces to be powered by Scottish windfarm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/08/canary-wharf-offices-and-retail-spaces-to-be-powered-by-scottish-windfarm-london","fields":{"bodyText":"Offices and retail spaces across the Canary Wharf business district will soon be powered by clean energy generated by a windfarm in Scotland. Canary Wharf Group, which manages the 60-hectare (150 acres) estate in east London, has struck a deal with one of the world’s biggest providers of renewable energy to meet almost three-quarters of its electricity demand from wind power. The deal is expected to help some of the UK’s biggest corporate names occupying office space in Canary Wharf – including EY, HSBC and BP – to cut their emissions while reducing their energy costs. Brookfield, an asset manager chaired by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, will provide Canary Wharf with green energy. The company, one of the world’s largest investors in renewable power, will do so by growing its renewables portfolio with the development of a new onshore windfarm in Scotland, which is due to begin generating electricity from 2026. The estate manager has bought renewable electricity for the business district from energy suppliers since 2012 but the deal with Brookfield is the first time it will source its clean electricity directly from a renewable energy project. The 15-year agreement could be extended to supply all of Canary Wharf’s 18m sq ft of office, retail and leisure spaces with 100% renewable electricity, according to Shobi Khan, the chief executive of Canary Wharf Group. Khan told the Guardian that the deal took three years to agree but should help to reduce electricity bills by about 50% compared with using power generated by gas power plants. The deal is part of a wider campaign to transform the estate into a sustainability leader, he said. “The point is to not only do something good for the environment but have it make good business sense, too,” Khan added. Brookfield has used its global portfolio of about 25,000 megawatts of renewable energy – the equivalent of all the UK’s onshore and offshore windfarms combined – to strike clean energy supply deals with about 700 corporate customers. The Canadian asset manager’s real estate investment arm also owns a 50% stake in Canary Wharf, which it acquired in 2014."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/10/mark-rutte-everyman-dutch-pm-whose-teflon-powers-finally-waned-netherlands","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-10T14:08:02Z","webTitle":"Mark Rutte: the everyman Dutch PM whose ‘Teflon’ powers finally waned","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/10/mark-rutte-everyman-dutch-pm-whose-teflon-powers-finally-waned-netherlands","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/10/mark-rutte-everyman-dutch-pm-whose-teflon-powers-finally-waned-netherlands","fields":{"bodyText":"He was the great survivor of Dutch politics, a man whose capacity to swerve criticism and survive scandal earned him the nickname “Teflon Mark”, combining backroom skills with everyman appeal to become the country’s longest-serving leader. But Mark Rutte came unstuck on Monday, telling shocked MPs and reporters in The Hague he would not be standing in the next elections after his divided coalition government collapsed on Friday over asylum policy. The decision brings to an end the 56-year-old’s 17-year tenure as leader of the liberal-conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and 13 years as prime minister of the Netherlands at the head of four different governments. “I do this with mixed feelings, with emotion,” he said. “But it feels right.” As the EU’s longest-serving government leader after Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, his name has been floated for international jobs, including at Nato and the European Council. In characteristically low-key style, however, Rutte said he harboured no such ambitions. For several years now, he has taught social studies once a week at a high school in The Hague. “Maybe I’ll do it a couple of times a week,” he said. Analysts have long said Rutte had three key assets: first, he was a skilful, savvy operator with a talent for building and maintaining unlikely alliances – so much so that his critics felt he was always more interested in power than principles. He has never found it hard, for example, to pander to the far right on issues such as immigration, “Dutch values” and integration, forming his first coalition in 2010 with the backing of the firebrand anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders. In Europe, too, his leadership of the “frugals” opposed to EU bailouts drew fury from member states in the south, who called him “Mr No”. But he managed ultimately to find common cause with Germany and France on most issues. Rutte’s second major asset was his image as “Mr Normal”. Only rarely was he out of step with the views of his voters, seeming at times to pick up shifts in public opinion even before they occurred (as an example, he initially supported, then condemned, the Netherlands’ “Zwarte Piet” blackface tradition). He still lives in the same part of The Hague where he grew up, in a house he bought with friends as a student, he bikes to work – except if he is in a hurry, when he drives a battered Saab – and goes on holiday with the same people. In short, Rutte projects the kind of down-to-earth, no-nonsense, cautious image the Dutch adore: he once said that owing too much to a bank would keep him awake, and on another occasion refused to let cleaners mop up his coffee after he spilt it in parliament, insisting on doing it himself. The youngest of seven children, his father Izaak’s first wife died in a Japanese internment camp in Indonesia. The family fled the former colony and started again from scratch in The Hague, with Izaak eventually marrying his late wife’s sister, Rutte’s mother. Rutte’s older brother died of Aids, which he has said made him realise “you only get one chance at life”. Rutte worked for Unilever before becoming junior social affairs minister in 2002, VVD party leader in 2006, and prime minister four years later. Perhaps the outgoing Dutch prime minister’s biggest advantage was that nothing ever seemed to stick to him. Even in 2021, when his coalition resigned over a scandal in which 20,000 families, many from minority ethnic backgrounds, were wrongly accused of childcare subsidy fraud, he bounced back, with the VVD increasing its seat tally at the next election. He also narrowly survived a no-confidence vote, as well as a parliamentary motion censuring his behaviour and accusing him of undermining public trust and “not speaking the truth” during particularly fraught coalition negotiations that year. Rutte ultimately ran out of road, however, over his demands for a limit on family reunifications for asylum seekers, a move bitterly opposed by his coalition partners ChristenUnie, a Christian democratic party, and the centre-left Democracy 66. A managerial rather than a visionary leader – his favourite quote is reportedly one of the former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt’s: “People with visions should see a doctor” – his longstanding policy of meeveren, altijd meeveren (go with the flow, always go with the flow) – finally failed him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2023/jul/14/wimbledon-semi-finals-jannik-sinner-v-novak-djokovic-carlos-alcaraz-v-daniil-medvedev-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-14T18:19:12Z","webTitle":"Wimbledon: Alcaraz powers past Medvedev to set up Djokovic final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jul/14/wimbledon-semi-finals-jannik-sinner-v-novak-djokovic-carlos-alcaraz-v-daniil-medvedev-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2023/jul/14/wimbledon-semi-finals-jannik-sinner-v-novak-djokovic-carlos-alcaraz-v-daniil-medvedev-live","fields":{"bodyText":"After two precision semi-finals, it’s time to wrap things up here. We’ll be back tomorrow for the women’s final between Ons Jabeur and the unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, and Daniel will be your guide for Novak Djokovic v Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. A tantalising weekend menu. Have a lovely evening – good night! I’m told that Alcaraz will be the youngest male Wimbledon singles finalist since his compatriot Rafa Nadal in 2006, who was just a month younger. This was the moment he made it: Novak has a way with words! So we have the long-predicted and tennis-dream final between the king and young pretender. The all-round best of all-time against the best 20-year old McEnroe has ever seen. The complete game and the grass court master against a firework forehand and brilliant drop shot, energy, youth and a quick, quick learner who has improved hugely through the fortnight. Where’s your money? Now we’re back to Claire and Tim in the studio. Over to Tim in his smart tie: “Some people have a good feel at the net but not a very good technique, but Alcaraz has it all. He has very good geometry. Lots of players these days are one-dimensional, but he has it all.” “He’s just so complete, mentally, physically and technically.” McEnroe’s report: “Medvedev looked resigned at some points. He did make a subtle adjustment, got back into it a couple of times but Alcaraz was able to remain relaxed and stay in control. It is unheard of that we have five breaks in a row at this level.” “Clearly the French Open affected him [Alcaraz]. The second set there was one of the best sets of tennis I’ve ever seen but then suddenly it was all over. I’m not sure why he had the cramp there but I’m sure his camp will have worked with him.” Medvedev disappears quickly off court with a smile and a wave and the stage belongs to Alcaraz “A dream for me, and to play a final here at Wimbledon, I can’t believe it. Its an amazing moment for me and time to keep dreaming! “He’s [Medvedev] is an amazing fighter and I had to be my best and play aggressive, be myself all the time, that was the key to serve the match. “Everybody knows it is going to be very difficult but I will fight, that is myself, I will believe in myself that I can beat him here. It will be tough time for me, I dream since I started playing tennis to play a final here, It is a final, it is no time to be afraid, to be tired, I will go for it.” And he quietly packs up his bag and prepares to leave. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 6-3 Medvedev From 15 all, Medvedev hits cross court into the tramlines, then Alcaraz is beaten. Alcaraz smiles before he serves and it is a beauty which Medvedev can only hit wildly out. And what a finish! After a superb rally, Medvedev comes up to the net to volley but Alcaraz prowls like a tiger and whips a cross court return with a kiss of the racket! He holds his hands to the sky in celebration. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 5-3 Medvedev * I’d like to see Medvedev as Jo’s love interest in Little Women, Professor Bhaer. But perhaps thats just me. From 30-30, Medvedev goes long and then Alcaraz pulls out a killer forehand return. Another break! And Alcaraz serves for the match. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 4-3 Medvedev An hors’ doeuvre of variety shots as Alcaraz fluff a volley between his legs and can’t get his racket out of the way when Medvedev approaches the net with an excocet. Alcaraz hits long to secure the break again. There’s life in this old dog yet! Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 4-2 Medvedev * Alcaraz isn’t keen on losing momentum in this match and has two break points. But Medvedez isn’t done yet and holds on in two epic baseline rallies to bring it back to deuce. He double faults to give Alcaraz advantage, saves another break point with an ace, hits a half volley into the net and then survives a fourth break point with a one-legged wild volley into an empty court. But the fifth break point does for him as Alcaraz breaks back straight away. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-2 Medvedev A changing wind suddenly blows over Centre Court as Medvedev breaks the Alcaraz serve with a mixture of inspirational shots and Alcaraz falling just fractionally off his game. Now he’s in the set, might he just dare to step towards the baseline? Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-1 Medvedev* A huge roar as Medvedev beats Alcaraz with a deep smash right into the corner, then aces. A big first serve makes it 40-0 –Alcaraz pulls back -but that’s a bobby-dazzler as he comes to the net and fires the ball like a bullet into the grass and even a flying Alcaraz can’t reach it. He’s on the board in the third set. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 3-0 Medvedev Some fallibility in the world No. 1 as he double faults to make it 30-30 but a deft volley wins one point, and Medvedev hits the next serve out. As they change ends, Medvedev sits on his chair and chats away with amused resignation – not sure who he’s talking to, perhaps just one of those conversations we all have with ourselves on one of those days. But up he gets to serve 3-0 down. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 2-0 Medvedev* A brilliant drop shot by Alcaraz to go 30-15 up on Medvedev’s serve. A double fault for 15-40 and the body language of his box wouldn’t inspire confidence in Mr Happy. A brilliant first serve by Medvedev but Alcaraz can better it. Medvedev’s serve is broken in the very first game of the third set. *Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 1-0 Medvedev These games are flying past so quickly. Medvedev has crept forward slightly to receive serve but there isn’t much he can do about such precision. Alcaraz wins to love and the spectators look at each other in awe. Alcaraz 6-3 6-3 Medvedev * Alcaraz is like a ballet dancer, so incredibly balanced and strong. Suddenly its 40-0 and Alcaraz has three set points. Two big Medvedev serves pull it back to 40-30 but Medvedev can’t cope with the deep return of his second serve and that’s the set! We get the fist pump. And Medvedev, looking altogether like a university professor who has lost his notes, stares aimlessly into space. *Alcaraz 6-3 5-3 Medvedev We’ve got new balls. And Alcaraz bounces them, and bounces again. Suddenly its 40-0 with a series of clinical serves and another and that’s the game. McEnroe says Medvedev’s tactic of standing so far back isn’t working. Alcaraz 6-3 4-3 Medvedev* In five Wimbledon appearances , this is Medvedev’s first semi-final, and he’s got a tricky opponent to experiment on. But he doesn’t help himself by missing a smash to go 0-15 down on his serve. After much to-ing and fro-ing he holds with a whipping forehand. *Alcaraz 6-3 4-2 Medvedev In the change of ends, Alcaraz munches on something that looks like cooking chocolate, and both drink from their reusable bottles. In the shirts battle, it is Lacoste v Nike . A brilliant drop volley gives Alcaraz the first point, which a sprinting Medvedev can’t’ reach. Is he going to shuffle forward towards the net at any point? Alcaraz wins to love. Alcaraz 6-3 3-2 Medvedev* Easy service game win to Medvedev, who even comes up to the net with a dinky volley to make it 40-0 and collects the final point when Alcaraz’s return is out. *Alcaraz 6-3 3-1 Medvedev Medvedev continuing to receive serve somewhere south of the Falkland Islands, and Alcaraz makes the most of it with dreamy delicacy. But Medvedev pulls back with a two-handed backhand return to make it 30-30. Alcaraz snatches a base-line rally to make it 40-30; and another to go 3-1 up. Easy pickings in only his fourth grass-court tournament! Alcaraz 6-3 2-1 Medvedev * A mega rally at 15-0 finishes when Medvedev hits long. Two more errors from Medvedev hands Alcaraz two break points. But he can’t make the most of them and soon its deuce. Some brilliant volleying in kissing distance of the net hands Alcaraz another break point and he pounces on a second serve to take early advantage in the set. Lots of slow motion fist shaking from his box. *Alcaraz 6-3 1-1 Medvedev Alcaraz, neat and tidy in the way that some people just are, no ink stains on his school shirt, plays a drop shot like a butterfly wing but just brushes it into the net to give Medvedev the hint of a chance. Then a double fault as his serve becomes suddenly fallible to give Medvedev a break point. Retorts with an ace. Then Medvedev returns the next serve into the net. A high class rally ends when Alcaraz bunny hops the game into the net. Two drop shots work to give Alcaraz the game. Alcaraz 6-3 0-1 Medvedev * Thanks Daniel, get well soon! Medvedev, looking sweaty under the roof, makes a good start to the second set holding to love, and with a lucky net cord to boot. And with that, my watch is over; here’s Tanya Aldred to croon you through the rest of this match. thanks all for your company and comments – sorry I couldn’t use them all – and enjoy the weekend. Shabbat shalom, and go in peace. *Alcaraz 6-3 Medvedev I don’t know, what was Medvedev thinking with that drop? It’s like when Rafa Benitez decided to play mind games with Alex Ferguson. Anyway, Alcaraz is quickly at 30-0, Medvedev then sends a return long, and when the same thing happens again, that’s enough for set one! Medvedev is, as we know, rather good, but Alcaraz is better and it’s hard to see how that differential is equalised. “Re the thread about empty seats,” says Susannah Clements. “We were there on Monday – queue for the ladies between matches was insane. Plus 20 minutes queuing for drinks. Then you have to wait for a break in games to get back in. It took over 45 minutes from rushing for the exit, to settling back in my seat with a drink. Don’t judge those empty seats too harshly!” Alcaraz 5-3 Medvedev* Alcaraz makes 0-15 but Medvedev is soon at 30-15, an ace down the middle doing the business. But another serve, into a similar area, is returned with interest, a forehand lopping cross-court onto the line, and when Medvedev tries a drop of his own, Alcaraz is onto it like a hyena, flipping a pick-up over the net for break point … converted when a half-courter invites the backhand into the tootsies! Alcaraz breaks, and will now serve for the first set. *Alcaraz 4-3 Medvedev My browser crashes, returning in time for me to hear Andrew Castle marvelling as how much Alcaraz’s backhand slice has come on this fortnight, as he holds to 15. “Enjoying your commentary, but have to disagree that it’s fine to pop out to the bar between semis and not return in time for the second match,” writes Gillian Forrester. “Incredible and sad to see how many vacant seats there are on Centre Court in the first set of Alcaraz vs Medvedev; very disrespectful to the players and annoying for us who would love to be there.” I don’t think it’s an issue to go for drink and a slash between matches, and see how that can take the best part of half an hour; I also don’t think it’s a big deal to miss the walk-out and knock-up, but yes, once the match is well into its first set, I don’t understand why people wouldn’t want to watch, though they can spend their time how they like once they’ve paid for a ticket. Alcaraz 3-3 Medvedev* Lovely from Alcaraz, the drop-lob combo making 15-all and a punishing forehand down the line 15-30; the world number one is starting to assert himself. But Medvedev gets to 30-all when another weapons-grade forehand hits the net, then challenges, successfully, when Alcaraz strays wide prior to dispensing another winner. A service winner then follows, and that’s a good hold from Medvedev; this is warming up. *Alcaraz 3-2 Medvedev Alcaraz targets the Medvedev forehand but it’s his that breaks down first, a framed shank handing over 0-15. Then, at 15-all, we see the first drop, beautifully played and disguised with Medvedev stranded somewhere in Southfields, before an exocet forehand whistles wide. No matter, another lovely drop raises game point and, you guessed it, a third seals the deal – which makes me wonder whether he can do it too often as that might encourage a change of tactic, and my guess is Alcaraz is happy with the status quo. Alcaraz 2-2 Medvedev* Alcaraz makes 0-15 with a backhand winner but Medvedev quickly does likewise. A service winner follows, then another on the backhand as his opponent makes the net, and the game is sealed with a booming forehand down the line. In comms, Mac reckons Alcaraz looks a bit nervous and that he’s not moving properly yet. *Alcaraz 2-1 Medvedev Medvedev asks a line judge to move along because they’re standing where he likes to return from, but at 15-all Alcaraz catches him again, a slice serve out wide too far away for him to reach – and even if he’d managed, his man was at the net to cut off any return. Still, Medvedev gets to 40-30 then, on the run, spanks a superb flat backhand cross-court for a winner before a net cord delivers him a second deuce. From there, Alcaraz quickly closes out, and neither of these are properly motoring yet. Alcaraz 1-1 Medvedev* Now Medvedev holds easily, to 15, closing out with a leaping backhand. *Alcaraz 1-0 Medvedev A wide delivery to open up and Medvedev, receiving almost in the royal box, can’t get a meaningful racket on it. Alcaraz holds to love. Righto, off we go again – Alcaraz to serve. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but for anyone put off their food by illness as is currently the case with me, peanut butter – Skippy, of course – on toast and salted caramel biscuits, not together but there’s an idea, are preventing me from wasting away. Out come our players, to a sparsely populated Centre Court. Mac isn’t happy that people have left, but it seems reasonable to me that they nip to the bar, and telly schedules won’t allow for a longer break. “Isn’t it a shame that a player can lose because he fails to act as his own line judge?” wonders Phil Haran. “If a mistake is made it should be automatically corrected by playing a let or awarding the correct point. I’ve seen more ‘missed’ line calls than ever but the technology is there to correct it.” Yeah, I think this is a fair question: you’d think the technology exists for a quick beep to signal in or out as with foot faults – and if it doesn’t I’m sure it won’t be long – in which case I agree, the ability to see whether a ball is in or out is not what we’re seeking to measure here. Coming up next: Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Daniil Medvedev [3]. It’s not a bad old life. Djokovic has now made 35 Grand Slam finals, which is another record – it’s previous holder was Chris Evert. Djokovic is on for five in a row, a calendar year grand slam, and who knows how many more majors. He’s playing better than ever, and explains that it was a hard match, the scoreline not reflecting the reality of what went down on the court. Sinner might’ve won the breaker but let him in with a few loose shots, though he’s proved himself a leader of the next generation and is a very good player. “It’s great to be part of this new generation, I love it,” he says, and would like to believe he’s playing better than ever. In an individual sport, you need to be in the best possible physical, mental and emotional state, not seeing his age as a “hindrance” – “36 is the new 26” – and wants to give back to the sport everything it’s given to him, his family and his team by playing as long as he can. Asked about the “hindrance” situation, he says the call might’ve changed the game and he had to regroup; he didn’t think it was an issue and usually he doesn’t extend his grunts, so there might’ve been an echo off the roof or something. He’ll now enjoy the second semi from his massage table, and it’s just unbelievable how brilliant and brilliantly articulate he is. It’s going to take something unfathomably brilliant to stop him. Sinner nets, and Djokovic has won a 45th straight match on Centre Court! It’s just totally ridiculous how incredible he is because sinner is a fine player who played well, and yet he didn’t even get close. as the man himself said, there are those who are good, who want to supplant him, but “it ain’t happening”. Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 (4-6) Djokovic Now it’s Djokovic who slips, as sinner dematerialises a forehand winner for 4-4; Sinner approaches the net to check he’s OK while, in comms, Todd Woodbridge gives us an Aussie metaphor for being flat on one’s face as Djokovic is, “like a lizard drinking”. And, well, Sinner nets a backhand, then another, and Djokovic has two match points… Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 (3-2) Djokovic Now then. Djokovic has something in his eye, but he’s still struggling to see the backhand return Sinner sends past him, punishing a second serve to secure an immediate mini-break. He cements it with a service winner and looks good, but as we know, lots of people do until suddenly they don’t and, as I type that, a double restores order. Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-6 Djokovic* Djokovic goes wide for 15-all, so retorts with an ace, but when sinner changes the direction of the next rally with a cunning backhand down the line, his squash shot drops long; 30-all. But the last thing Djokovic needs is help, and he sort of gets it, landing a serve on the sideline – he aimed for it – and the ball dies – he didn’t expect it to. A forehand winner follows, and that means we’ll have a tiebreak, Djokovic’s uncanny ability to win these increasing of late – at the French he was six from six, without a single unforced error. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 6-5 Djokovic An ace gives Sinner 40-15 and a forehand into the corner guarantees him a breaker; he’s played his best tennis in this set, though he also played some good stuff in the third. In comms, they think Djokovic is annoyed with the crowd, supporting sinner partly because they want a contest and partly because they don’t love him, showing displeasure then repurposing it as fuel. He’ll now serve to stay in the set. Sinner 3-6 4-6 5-5 Djokovic* I remember watching Wimbledon years ago and Connors, coming to the end of his career, was losing. “Come on Jimmy!” shouted someone from the crowd – because of course they liked him once he started losing, as was the case with Martina and Steffi too – and he replied “I’m trying!” That feels like where Sinner is now, but then he lands a huge forehand return for 15-30 … after which Djokovic swipes a forehand wide! Is God fallible? Is there a glitch in the matrix? Two set points for Sinner! Djokovic serves a fault then takes a moment as the umpire asks for quiet, and the way this match has gone, as ace down the T will soon be upon us. But no, instead Sinner goes long then, after landing a return onto the line, has a chance at a forehand, inside court, and with loads at which to aim! But he goes wide with it, and as he contemplates deuce will know that he’s not made the most of that opportunity because, for what feels like the first time, Djokovic didn’t confiscate it from him. And that’ll hurt Sinner even more than watching the aces go by, all the more so when he accelerates through deuce to secure yet another hold. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 5-4 Djokovic Er, Jannik Sinner for one. He races to 40-0, then Djokovic creams a gorgeous return down the line as Sinner comes in – which he does behind his next serve too, his volley too good. I can’t overstate this point: Sinner is playing and has played well, but he’s still not landed a punch. Sinner 3-6 4-6 4-4 Djokovic* Oooh yeah! A glorious forehand winner down the line gives Sinner 0-15, but a forehand return just misses the baseline – I think. Like Tim, I’m surprised there was no challenge there, all the more so when a serve out wide is good enough for 30-15. Soon after, it’s 4-4, and who’d be surprised if Djokovic broke next game? *Sinner 3-6 4-6 4-3 Djokovic For the first time in a while, Sinner holds to love, but can he tax Djokovic when he serves 90 seconds from now? Sinner 3-6 4-6 3-3 Djokovic* Sinner does more complaining about the slipperiness at change of ends, and he needs to make sure this doesn’t get into his head. It doesn’t seem to be – he smokes a forehand for 15-all, only to then thwack another into the net immediately afterwards. From there, more ridiculous serving finishes off the game, and Sinner is struggling to make an impression in this set, though he’s actually playing pretty well. “Is it too much to ask of an opponent to put up some resistance,” wonders Mohammed Yasser. “Could’ve broke first game but gets broken himself. I’m guessing a reverse of last year is off?” I think that’s harsh, Sinner’s going everything he can, problem being the lad he’s playing is alright at this. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 3-2 Djokovic Djokovic directs Sinner about the court and Sinner obliges, haring from a get in one corner to another in the other, before a drop shot leaves him stranded – though he makes a laudable effort to reach it, sliding like Sol Campbell. Sinner, though, soon plants a forehand onto the line for 30-15 and secures his hold to 30. Sinner 3-6 4-6 2-2 Djokovic* Again, Sinner gets to 30-all on the Djokovic serve, and when he’s handed a second delivery at 30-40 he doesn’t miss out, a leaping backhand return fizzing down the line for a winner and deuce. For all the difference it makes. Djokovic closes out easily, an almost dismissive volley at the net clinching the game while, before the next, Sinner cleans his shoes pointedly, looking at the umpire who he knows will not and cannot intervene. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 2-1 Djokovic Ach, at 0-15, Sinner finds a decent first serve, so Djokovic returns it well then sends a gorgeous backhand slice down the line and curling away, for a clean winner and another example of a shot he’s honed in recent years. More slicing follows, then Sinner nets a backhand and complains to the umpire that the surface is slippery and losing footing on a forehand earlier in the rally. Three break points to Djokovic, who burns the first with an overhit backhand to end the longest rally of the match and loses the second with a colossal ace out wide. Again, credit to Sinner who hasn’t panicked, faded or lost temper – OK, I can’t lie, I’m totally there for him totally losing it – and another booming serve, out wide again, is good enough for deuce. Yet another service winner and another ace follow, and that’s serious behaviour from the youngster. He’s got some work to do snd it won’t be soon, but of the players on tour who’ve yet to win a major, he looks the most likely to at some point. Sinner 3-6 4-6 1-1 Djokovic* I guess Djokovic reminds me a little of Jimmy Anderson, both in terms of his lithe, athletic build, and his total devotion to improvement. For the wobble seam read the serve we’re looking at now, and as I type that, a second-serve ace onto the T underlines the point; he’s having an absolute laugh here, sending another ace out wide as Jelena, his wife, chuckles to herself. *Sinner 3-6 4-6 1-0 Djokovic “He’s weirdly become one of the best servers of all time,” says Calv Betton of Djokovic. “It’s the accuracy.” And the ability to deliver it under pressure. But Sinner’s quite good too, and he holds to 30; it’s worth noting that he’s played well and consistently today, nor has he taken a backward step; he’s just not been able to find a way at the big moments because who is? Sinner 3-6 4-6 Djokovic* An ace down the middle then a service winner; what can you do? Then a serve out wide and a clean-up wrongfooting forehand to the same corner; nothing whatsoever. Sinner does, though, plant a forehand onto the baseline to which Djokovic can’t respond, saving the first of three set points; can you guess what happens next? You can and you can’t: Djokovic does serve an ace, but it’s out wide. He’s such a tease, and he leads by two sets to love appearing to have levels in reserve if he needs them. This is brilliance so natural, expected and understated as to be deeply unsettling. *Sinner 3-6 4-5 Djokovic Sinner’s looking to get to the net now, daring Djokovic to pass him – he’s got to try something new – and quickly makes 40-15. A booming serve and backhand to the corner follow … so Djokovic pastes a backhand winner down the line! Ridiculous behaviour. Sinner, though remains unfazed, another serve-volley point forcing Djokovic to serve for the set. Sinner 3-6 3-5 Djokovic* Sinner will know he’s running out of road in this set – and, therefore, in this match – and with new balls in play, I’d expect him to really go after this game. In a rare case of me being right, that is indeed what happens – he properly attacks Djokovic’s serve, coming to the net early having already hit two shots that’d rally-enders against anyone else. He does make the putaway, but shortly afterwards it’s 40-15 … though Djokovic shouts towards his box when an error gives Sinner a sniff. He’s tossing the ball too far in front, he reckons … so then ends the game with another service winner, and needs just one more for a 2-0 lead. Meantime, Calvin Betton returns on my point that Sinner is holding easily. “Djokovic does that on purpose when he’s a break up. He throws games away so the opponent has no rhythm. It’s risky but works.” *Sinner 3-6 3-4 Djokovic Eeesh, is the pressure and disappointment telling? Down 0-15, Sinner drags a forehand wide – Djokovic has been playing to that flank – then at 15-30, a backhand sails over the tramlines. Sinner, though, is nobody’s expletive, an error from Djokovic preceding a forehand winner down the line for deuce – he’s found first serves when he needs them – and another, followed by an ace, keeps the second set alive. “How can anyone like salad cream but not sandwich spread?” wonders Simon McMahon. “I don’t understand. They’re like Borg and McEnroe. You can’t have one without the other.” I think it’s probably OK in lieu of butter and with another filling, but I’d not enjoy a sandwich that was just bread and it. I’d also be ravenous after scranning it. Sinner 3-6 2-4 Djokovic* Excellent de-fence from Sinner, a squash-shot on the stretch keeping him in the rally before a backhand down the line makes 0-15; Djokovic responds with another service winner. At 30-15, though, Sinner reads a ball into the forehand corner, looping a winner down the line, but then can’t control his response to serve directed out wide to the forehand. No matter, a forehand into the corner facilitates an overhead putaway and once again Djokovic must serve at deuce … but facing a second delivery, though Sinner picks the right backhand return, it’s wide, just, then a superb Djokovic get prompts a forehand error, and another decent situation evaporates. *Sinner 3-6 2-3 Djokovic Sinner is holding easily, apart when he’s broken; Djokovic is holding with aggravation, without being broken. That’s the difference here. Sinner 3-6 1-3 Djokovic* The crowd are desperate for Sinner to make a match of this, and they go wild when the two men face off at the net, a rat-a-tat-tat exchange won by a rasping backhand from sinner that makes 15-all. But then, controversy! Djokovic grunts mid-point, having already cracked a backhand down the line that Sinner stretches to return; “Hindrance!” intones the umpire; “15-30”. Djokovic approaches but doesn’t really unburden, Henman says he’s never seen that before, and Sinner did play his shot, but on the other hand, rules are rules and who doesn’t want their moment in the sun. Oh man, imagine the chinwag at change of ends if there’s a break here; Djokovic quickly makes 30-all, killjoy that he is, then finds a gorgeous response after Sinner sends his drop back across the net. It’s incredible really, I’m absolutely certain Djokovic wants the umpire to be wearing his racket as a necklace, but instead he’s davka using it for shots of delicate beauty … though as I type that, Sinner punishes a backhand winner down the line for deuce! Relief as our set-to remains in prospect, and after a succession of groundstrokes thunked down the middle, Djokovic goes long to cede advantage! It’d surely be too pretty for that hindrance call to alter the flow of the match and shonuff Djokovic quickly yanks us back to deuce, then the umpire reminds us he exists, chastising the champ for taking too long serving … just before he disburses a service winner. It’s incredible how he’s maintaining composure here, and when Sinner nets, you can’t help but think that Djokovic has actually been helped by that intervention, because he now has a sense of injustice while Sinner has again been shown the apparently infinite extent of what he’s up against. *Sinner 3-6 1-2 Djokovic Oh dear. Djokovic redirects a forehand down the line for 0-15, then two unforced errors and all of a sudden it’s 0-40; such is life. Sinner, though, saves the first break point when his opponent drops long, the second with a forehand winner inside-out into the corner, but in a microcosm of the match, he then slams a flat forehand long, and gets what he deserves. It’s hard enough playing the best of all time without handing over gimmes like that, but that’s the difference really; everyone does that apart from him. Sinner 3-6 1-1 Djokovic* How do we feel about dominant champions? On the one hand, it doesn’t feel healthy to see Djokovic cruising through majors at 36; on the other, Alcaraz was on top in Paris till the stress of it all took its toll and that won’t happen again; on a hard court, he’ll be even more of a handful; and people tune in to see if someone can beat the man. Darts isn’t the same since Phil Taylor retired and Michael van Gerwen dropped a few levels, snooker exploded when it boasted consecutive unbeatable champions, and Roger Federer was pretty good for our game. Anyway, Sinner makes 15-all with a lovely sliced drop, only to shank a backhand at 30-all; “a poor miss,” says Tim in comms. Djokovic hasn’t made a first serve in this game, then he does, but Sinner challenges and it’s out – decent peepers – but it makes no difference, because the Italian then frames one. He’s still making an impression when returning though; he just needs to, as the abovementioned Van Gerwen likes to say, “do the right things at the right times”. *Sinner 3-6 1-0 Djokovic Nice from Sinner, underarming a big forehand from corner to corner for 30-15. Neither he nor our match can deal with the concession of a break at this juncture, so the ace he finds at 30-all is crucial, and from there he closes out. Sinner 3-6 Djokovic* Sinner stretches to reach a return – that’s a fantastic get – and Djokovic errs long for 0-15! Then serves an ace. Then serves another ace. He is not human. Then serves another ace. He does well not to laugh, I told you he wasn’t human, then he serves a service winner. He’s an absolute disgrace, the best player under pressure there’s ever been in men’s tennis and perhaps only Chris Evert and Serena are his equal in women’s. He leads by one set to love, of course he does, but Sinner is in this match. *Sinner 3-5 Djokovic At change of ends we see that both Felicity Kendall and Floella Benjamin are in the house, two staples of an 80s childhood. It’s a while since anyone asked me what my favourite shape is, but in my Play chool days, I always hoped they’d go through the square window – to my eternal shame as, at the age of 44, I’ve realised that the circle is better. Sinner holds to 15, and is moving through his serice games really easily, problem being he’s ceded one break point and Djokovic being Djokovic, he seized it so will now serve for the first set. Sinner 2-5 Djokovic* This is a really fun match so far, one of the highest-standard I’ve seen this fortnight – though, for it to be a sustaining contest, Sinner could really do without falling behind. And again he gets into the game, banging a forehand winner down the line for 15-all only to net when he shouldn’t for 30-15. From there, Djokovic mooches to within a game of the first set, again sealing one with an ace down the middle. “Salad Cream? Just thinking about makes me want to be violently sick,” advises John Windmill, our pictures man. “Oh, Daniel.” But John, it’s so deliciously tangy – though just to be clear, I do not like sandwich spread. *Sinner 2-4 Djokovic In the interests of sharing the wealth, this is the best and most nostril-invading chrayne I’ve found; back on court, Sinner holds to love, and in some ways this is a classic Djokovic set, much closer to being broken than breaking, apart from the time he actually broke. Sinner 1-4 Djokovic* Further to Zack’s mayonnaise point, let me say here, very clearly, that salad cream is by far the superior condiment, thanks principally to the presence of taste. It’s not fashionable, no – though, last summer, Anya Hindmarch turned it into an ice cream – but still. Anyroad up, Sinner lets Djokovic off the hook at 15-all, hitting man not space so passed at the net, but then a slice drops fractionally long and this time yerman pounces, swinging a majestic inside-out backhand onto the line for break point. Djokovic has served fantastically this year but Sinner is creating opportunities … burning this one when on top in the rally, going cross with line open. He knows it too, indicating the shot he should’ve played, and seconds later it’s 4-1, an exclamation mark added to it with the ace down the T that clinches it. Sinner might worry that he won’t get many chances and he’s already missed four, but he’ll be telling himself there’s no reason he won’t keep making them. *Sinner 1-3 Djokovic Sinner quickly makes 30-0 before slamming an ace down the T. He needed that, though he’s actually playing pretty well, and a canny high-kicking second serve sets up a 40-15 rally which he finishes with yet another sizeable forehand. He’s on the board. I cannot wait to see Eubanks play again. Sinner 0-3 Djokovic* A terrific backhand cross-court, dug out almost from behind him, gives Sinner 0-15. But from there, Djokovic consolidates convincingly, and already the match looks within his command. “Challah Sandwich??? That’s borderline apikorsus!” writes Zack Dzialowski, who for those unfamiliar with the term, just called me a heretic. “Challah must never be eaten with anything besides mayonnaise or chrayne (possibly allowed to toast the leftovers on Moitze Shabbos!). A friend of mine is rather keen on toasted challah on Shabbat morning, but otherwise, chrayne – a glorious meld of beetroot and horseradish, the most beautiful shade of mauve, is tremendous, likewise hummus, but challah is also very good slapped around liver sausage or viennas. *Sinner 0-2 Djokovic (*denotes server) Sinner is the first player since Henman in 2002 to make the semis without facing a seed, but so far he looks fine with that, so of course as I type those words he sticks another forehand into the top of the net for 30-all. It’s amazing the power he generates off his chicken legs, but a swiped forehand drops wide and now it’s Djokovic with break point. Sinner really can’t afford to cede the advantage so early … but he does, a forehand sent wide; response required. Sinner 0-1 Djokovic* (*denotes server) In the process of losing the first point, Sinner slips – one on which to keep an eye – then at 30-0, he finds a decent pass, Djokovic unable to reach his volley at the net. Already, the world number one is looking to stick Sinner on his bike, hitting towards corners, but when he goes wide, he finds himself serving at 30-all, and facing a second delivery Sinner steps in then runs around his backhand to send as winner cross-court for break point! But another forehand towards the line is more accurate, making deuce, whereupon we enjoy the best rally of the match so far, Sinner ending it abruptly with a brutal forehand that isn’t even close to the corer, and we learn that, during this tournament, only Alcaraz has hit a bigger ball. This time, though, break point vanishes with a netted forehand, and from there, Djokovic closes out. That was a helluva start to the match. “I was there!” tweets Robert Walnut of the 2001 final. And off we go! Djokovic to serve. “Challah is like brioche,” reckons Mark Woldin, “to be lathered with butter, eaten with a hot coffee nearby. A fresh hot bagel with cream cheese and lox is one of the glories of the Western World. Get on board, Daniel!” If I’m totally honest, I find what I know to be a classic sandwich somewhat bland. Put me in cheirem. Out come our players, Sinner leading the way. “On the important note of bagels v challah,” emails Edan Tal, “I have conducted similarly lengthy research. I think it all depends on the quality and a good quality bagel trumps challah for a closed sandwich as challah tends to crumble. But a good bagel should be ashamed of its hole and be nearly closed at the point of consumption, as seen at Beigel Bake. A holy bagel is no match for challah though. Also, do you not think Grodzinski’s in Stamford Hill is a fair match for Daniel’s?” It’s years since I went to Grodz in N17, but I’ll have a shy next time I’m visiting my wife’s dressmaker – Tiferes in Dunsmure Road for anyone wanting a top bloke and craftsman. I find the challah sandwich can be prevented from crumbling by rapid insertion into facehole. “On court I try to do the right things, but off court I can be a classic one,” Sinner tells BBC when explaining he’s not as serious as he seems and is actually quite funny. He’s from northern Italy near the Austrian border, and in general, folk from there are said to be more stereotypically Austrian than Italian in temperament, but on a very basic level he seems sound. He’s also a tremendous all-round athlete, good enough to have been a pro skier and footballer, such that even if he wasn’t an interesting bloke, which he is, he’d still have the personality proxies we all wish for. Tim Henman is in the BBC studio, wondering how on earth this tournament ever got finished playing one day fewer and with no roofs, noting that rallies are shorter these days. I’d not thought of that, but I guess if points are serve, return, putaway volley, it makes perfect sense. It’s funny, though, that two of my all-time favourite finals were completed on Monday, Edberg beating Becker in 1990 and Ivanisevic finally getting his title in 2001 by seeing off Rafter – coincidentally, Henman’s one that really got away. Regular readers will, no doubt, be wondering where on earth Coach Calvin Betton has got to with his pithy tactical breakdowns, and I’m pleased to report that the answer is right here: “Can’t see anyway Djokovic is troubled. He’ll make too many balls and keep Sinner moving so he never has a set base to hit his big shots out of. Medvedev and Alcaraz could be interesting. If Medvedev serves well then it will be really tight. Alcaraz probably just has enough to hit through him. Medvedev doesn’t have much to hurt with if his serve isn’t happening. The key shot will be Alcaraz’s drop shot cos Medvedev stands so far back.” I wonder if he’ll adjust there. I imagine he’ll stick with his usual position to return, but he must know he needs a plan to combat one of the best and, increasingly, most renowned shots in the game. Real talk: bagels do not, in my opinion, make for any kind of decent sandwich. No give, hard to arrange a decent filling to bread ratio, and just not that tasty. Challah is far, far better in every aspect, and the extensive, decades-long research I’ve undertaken in this important area tells me that the best in London can be found at Daniels – or, indeed Daniel’s, depending on where you look – in Temple Fortune. I’m not sure whether to thank or blame Oli Goldman for bringing this monstrosity to my attention. I guess you might argue that anything is improved by its insertion between two slices of bread, but you might also contact The Hague. It’s minging in London today, so I’m almost certain these matches will take place with the roof on. I doubt it’ll make much difference to Djokovic, but Sinner will probably be pleased as indoors tends to favour the harder hitter, and against the greatest, you need every advantage you can get. Hello and welcome to Wimbledon 2023 – day 12! Our women’s final is set and now it’s time for the men. We begin with the defending champion, playing his 12th semi-final at the All England Club – he’s won nine – a venue at which he’s not been beaten since 2017. And it’s hard to see that changing here, given his earth-shattering ability, spectacular form, and sense of mission. He is not on course for a calendar-year Grand Slam – rather it seems almost inevitable. However, there’s always a however. Jannik Sinner comes from the third generation of players bested by Novak Djokovic, but unlike most, he knows he can beat him – not because he has, but because he nearly did, losing from two sets to love up in last year’s quarter-finals. Sinner can easily rationalise that he’s a much better player now, more settled in his game, more at home in these surroundings and better able to negotiate the big moments – plus he can hit anyone, and I mean anyone, off the court. He’ll need to play better than ever before, but of all the men on the tour bar Carlos Alcaraz, he has the game and coldness most suited to ruining Djokovic’s day. Talking of Alcaraz, he has again been brilliant through this tournament, his explosive forehand not just the most thrilling shot in the game but one of the greatest sights in all sport. But Daniil Medvedev is an opponent who’s seen it all, gradually growing into the fortnight with a serve big enough to trouble anyone and a tactic of standing beyond the baseline that might just neutralise his opponent’s power. Of course, that opponent is not underfurnished in the guile department, but this is only his third major semi and in his last one, just a month ago, he succumbed to cramp. So, though Alcaraz has unshakeable confidence that he’s good enough to win this, now, he doesn’t know for sure, and Medvedev will be doing all he can to make him live that uncertainty. This is going to be good!

The coming-of-age novel set in the mid 1960s, with some flashes into the present, follows Mae, a lonely teenager who drops out of school after finding herself drawn into the new world of Warhol’s storied Factory in Manhattan. While art and drama and debauchery happen around her among the artist and his acolytes, Mae has the more prosaic job of typist. She is transcribing recordings of conversations that will form the basis of a: A Novel, Warhol’s (real) experimental book from 1968. “I feel things work if you just don’t often see that person,” Flattery says of her version of Warhol. “It’s in their interest to remain out of your eyeline. They’ll only have the power if they make themselves like a distant, inaccessible figure.” Flattery’s reimagining of Warhol might see him as distant, but 36 years after his death, he is ever-present in the public’s imagination. In fact, the recent obsession with him in theatre, film and books can make it seem as though you are never more than 6ft away from a Warhol-related event. Opening on 31 March at London’s Fashion and Textile museum is Andy Warhol: The Textiles, a survey of his lesser-seen textile designs made in his time as a successful commercial artist in the 1950s and early 60s. In April, the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris will launch a show of the mid-1980s paintings he made with Jean-Michel Basquiat. Last year The Collaboration, Anthony McCarten’s play, which premiered at the Young Vic and later transferred to New York, explored the relationship between the two artists – a film version, directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, is in the works. Last year also brought a high-profile six-part documentary series on Netflix made by Ryan Murphy, based on Warhol’s diaries, which were published posthumously in 1989. At last September’s New York fashion week, Tommy Hilfiger’s catwalk show was indebted to the artist. Perhaps we are seeing the long tail of his incessant industriousness and boundless influence. “Warhol is omnipresent. Somehow he seems to, in this digital, internet age, strike a chord with people,” says Richard Chamberlain, co-curator of the textiles exhibition, and co-author of the book Pop: Design, Culture, Fashion 1956-1976. “I think his subject matter, although it can be quite deep and thought-provoking, is quite accessible. And there’s so much about the man and what he was involved with, which is interesting to people.” Flattery says that she was particularly influenced by the artist’s experimental films from the 1960s. The Hilfiger fashion week show also called on the Factory years, with broader nods to Warhol’s silver clouds installation, his superstar muses and his nous for branding. The pair were friends in the 1980s – “you could say it is a meeting of preppy minds” Hilfiger said in September. Anything that draws on the Factory is immediately evocative of the era. It was in the mid-1960s when a Warhol look first solidified in the public consciousness: jeans and a Breton or black top, with a leather jacket and sunglasses, all presented with an inscrutable gaze. The move away from the homogeneity of the 1950s into an outfit of the counterculture isn’t unique to Warhol. “To me, it’s a perennial popularity of mid-1960s bohemian modernist style,” says Nathanial Weiner, lecturer in cultural studies at Central Saint Martins, London . “People really liked that era, because it’s sort of the pinnacle, almost of western casual dress.” After he was shot by Valerie Solanas in 1968, Warhol withdrew from some of the free-wheeling aspects of the Factory, and honed his outfits into a more toned-down uniform of blue jeans and shirt, blazer and tie. It managed to seem both unremarkably plain, yet uniquely Warholian. Andy the worker. His life and work started to revolve around more established versions of celebrity, rather than around his own creations. By the 1980s Warhol was often clad all in black, in jeans, polo neck and a jacket, with New Balance or white Reebok Classic trainers. Ever more rake-thin and with his silver-blonde wig at its most shocking, this is a stark vision of Warhol – perhaps indicative of a scramble for relevancy in his friendship with then up-and-coming art star Jean-Michel Basquiat. This latter look, particularly the hair, has become a signifier of Warhol. It is the version that actor Paul Bettany plays in The Collaboration. David Bowie performed it in Julian Schnabel’s 1996 Basquiat biopic. “I really didn’t want him to overshadow the book,” says Nicole Flattery of Nothing Special. “I could go back through the appearances of Andy Warhol in films: he’s in the film The Doors [played by Crispin Glover] and Factory Girl [played by Guy Pearce]. I feel with a presence like that, if you don’t get it fully right it can really mess up everything.” It’s not just his look but also his personal life that seems to continue to capture people’s imagination. “I thought that the recent mini-series, The Andy Warhol Diaries, was very interesting,” says Scott King, a graphic designer and creator of The Debrist Manifesto, a book on art-world failure and the pursuit of perfectionism. “It showed him as an active participant in love and disappointment and – quite boring-looking – weekends away in the Hamptons. It humanised him and showed a tenderness, a sadness. I mean, the best work he made was incredibly melancholic wasn’t it? But we don’t usually associate him with tenderness.” But, as photographer Nat Finklestein’s 1999 book The Factory Years displays, Warhol and his 1960s coterie had already long since created a vision of indelible debauched cool. “The Warhol stance,” says Chamberlain, “the very sort of hip, Velvet Underground attitudes, that is still very refreshing, and very vital to people. I think there is a Warhol that still has an edginess.” Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery is published by Bloomsbury (£16.99)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T12:51:53Z","webTitle":"Johnson takes swipe at Truss plans for fracking and North Sea drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","fields":{"bodyText":"Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift a ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The comments will be viewed as a jibe at Truss, who last week pledged to “end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking”, and is said to want to issue up to 130 new drilling licences for oil and gas companies to explore new fields in the North Sea. Reflecting on his future, Johnson said he was “ready to get on with life”, and he refused to be drawn on whether he would disappear quickly from politics, like David Cameron, or remain on the backbenches, as Theresa May has done. “Only time will tell, is my answer on that one,” he replied. “My intention – and what I certainly will do – is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me.” Johnson also evaded questions on whether he had any regrets about his premiership, saying he would leave it to “younger, fitter, more active journalists than me” to assess. Pressed on what message he had for people worried about paying their energy bills this winter amid rising inflation and the threat of a recession, he said people should be braced for a “very tough winter and we just have to accept that”. “We’re on your side,” he insisted, adding there would be a further package of support from the next prime minister, who will be announced next Monday and will take office the following day. The “future will be better when we’re more self-reliant” and less dependent on energy imports, Johnson predicted. After being accused by Rishi Sunak of ignoring the harms of lockdown during the Covid pandemic, Johnson said the criticism that it had caused the huge backlog of NHS surgery was an “inversion of logic”. Instead, he said, the opposite was the case; if the three national lockdowns had not been ordered, the NHS would be in an “even worse” position. Johnson will travel to meet the Queen in Balmoral to formally resign next Tuesday, with his successor formally appointed shortly after. The new prime minister will return to London to appoint a cabinet, and will then face questions in the Commons on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T09:58:46Z","webTitle":"Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – visual guide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/war-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-visual-guide-ukraine-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine’s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine’s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine’s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine’s national grid and connecting it to Russia’s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant’s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia’s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T16:32:59Z","webTitle":"Ukraine pilots being trained to fly F-16 jets, says Nato","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/15/ukraine-pilots-trained-f-16-jets-nato-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said that the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. “The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them,” the former prime minister of Norway said as he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels. The development follows months of internal debate in Washington over the risks of Ukraine deploying F-16s to attack targets on Russian territory and potentially escalating the conflict. The US has control over the jets’ re-export from any country that has them in its arsenal. As recently as February the US president, Joe Biden, declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine’s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Kyiv has in recent days warned that its long-anticipated counteroffensive is running into Russia’s air and artillery superiority. Despite those challenges, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said on Thursday that progress in its counteroffensive was being made, with Ukraine regaining control over 4o sq miles (103 sq km) since the weekend. Ukrainian forces were said to have pushed 2 to 4 miles into formerly occupied lands. Hromov told journalists that his troops had benefited from the provision of MiG-29 planes from Poland and Slovakia and claimed, without providing evidence, that Russian soldiers were deliberately inflicting wounds upon themselves to avoid battle. Hromov said: “The Ukrainian army has gained considerable experience and skill on the battlefield this year, and we are ready and will continue to fight until the complete liberation of our own territories, even with our bare hands. With heavy weapons from our allies, this will happen faster.” Ukraine’s army is said to have advanced by 2 miles near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia region and by up to 4 miles near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: “There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. The enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces.” Stoltenberg said western hardware was making a difference in the fighting. Moscow has widely disseminated video footage of US Bradley armoured vehicles and German-made Leopard tanks being hit by Russian fire. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine retained sufficient firepower for the battle to come. “I think the Russians have shown us that same five vehicles about 1,000 times from 10 different angles,” he said. “But quite frankly, the Ukrainians still have a lot of combat capability, combat power. “This will continue to be a tough fight, as we anticipate it, and I believe that the element that does the best in terms of sustainment will probably have the advantage at the end of the day.” The US chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said it was too early “to put any estimates” on how long the Ukrainian counteroffensive would last. He said: “This is a very difficult fight; it is a very violent fight and it will likely take a considerable amount of time and at high cost.” Russian military bloggers have claimed as many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike by a US-made Himars rocket system earlier this week, although Ukrainian officials declined to comment. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark were sending “high priority” air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery would be completed within weeks. Last month, it emerged the UK had already delivered multiple Storm Shadow cruise missiles, giving Ukraine’s defence a new long-range strike capability. That move had prompted threats from the Kremlin and earlier this week Belarus’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, engaged in further nuclear sabre-rattling as he announced that Russian tactical warheads would be relocated to Belarusian territory. Stoltenberg said the situation was being monitored but that it did not appear to be a significant move. “We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing,” he said. “So far, we haven’t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture”. He added: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.” Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia to assess the risks to Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. The dam’s reservoir provides the cooling water for the plant. After his inspection, Grossi said measures had been taken to stabilise the situation but he added that inspectors would stay at the facility, in a sign of the concerns the visit had raised among officials at the UN’s atomic watchdog."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-22T01:49:30Z","webTitle":"In the new gold rush, farmers are asked to decide between food, carbon and renewable energy – but we need them all | Gabrielle Chan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/22/in-the-new-gold-rush-farmers-are-asked-to-decide-between-food-carbon-and-renewable-energy-but-we-need-them-all","fields":{"bodyText":"This week we are expecting representatives of a solar energy company to come to our farm in southern New South Wales. They want to build next door. We are not in a renewable energy zone but we are close to existing transmission lines. It is a traditional mixed agricultural area, with relatively safe rainfall by southern Australian standards. We are also classed as inner regional, close to population centres. In theory, we could grow food, energy or carbon. One of the biggest issues that comes across my desk as a rural editor is the debate over changing land use. As with most rural issues, eventually it comes home. We are not alone. Across the country, communities are debating how best to plan for old and new land uses without much guidance or support from governments or the companies pursuing the new gold. Competing land claims range from food to mining precious metals to solar energy to wind turbines to carbon farming. Our stories about these issues – such as a windfarm in Nundle or a coal seam gas mine on the Liverpool Plains or the Darling Downs – are some of the most closely read and contested. The issue is not space. Australia is big. Farmers themselves need power so will be expanding their own power production. The issue is that everyone wants land close to existing infrastructure and populations to deliver food or energy at scale. While smart policy would accept that combined land use is the future, a key factor for farmers will be the potential returns per hectare. As Australian farmers have become some of the least trade protected in the world, the mighty dollar is the key determinant of survival in a dry climate. Will one hectare of food give a greater economic return than one hectare of solar panels or one hectare of carbon farming or one hectare of native habitat or biodiversity in the predicted “green Wall Street” markets? And how will this new use affect environmental assets such as ground and surface water, or infrastructure such as roads? These are the decisions farmers will be weighing up. The reality is, state and federal governments and Australians living in metropolitan areas are increasingly looking to regional landscapes to deliver affordable energy and greater emission reductions after more than a wasted decade of climate idiocy. At the same time, global corporations are hunting for carbon credits to offset business behaviours and production they don’t want to change or have not changed fast enough. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter All of this must be done while increasing the volume and health benefits of the food already grown. Consumers are increasingly demanding cheap food produced with lower emissions, higher animal welfare standards and greater transparency. Australian food producers have been going like “stabbed rats” for the past three years to take advantage of higher commodity prices and three consecutive La Niñas to grow more food. It was all very welcome, unless you were flooded out. Elsewhere, big trends continue to collide. There was a searing heatwave in Europe. Food inflation has been running rampant, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, higher input costs, higher labour costs, supply chain issues and in some cases increased supermarket profits. Nations are rethinking their food systems and keeping more in the larder. India, responsible for 40% of world’s rice exports, recently banned exports of non-basmati white rice. It is just one example of a post-Covid world where countries and individuals want to become a little more self-sufficient. Equally, no nation wants to be living in energy poverty and Australia has the capacity to be a renewable superpower. Yet last week the Bureau of Meteorology forecast warmer and drier conditions for the coming months, saying “higher than usual maximum temperatures are very likely”. Previously optimistic farmers in our neck of the woods are countenancing a “bobtail spring”, cut short by higher temperatures and less rain. Firm policy guidelines are needed about how these climate and market forces hit the ground. A decade of denial from the Morrison government has led to a stampede to catch up to provide energy and carbon sequestration. There is a new gold rush, and it needs land. Consistent sensible land management policy that lasts more than one political term will be vital. Without it, rural communities will be susceptible to breathless campaigns like Tuesday’s Rally Against Reckless Renewables, attended by the likes of Matt Canavan, who is suddenly worried about “pristine rainforest and wildlife habitat”. If you don’t believe me, consider the valedictory speech of Andrew Campbell, who led the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, last month. At the National Rural Press Club in Canberra he was brutally honest about the challenge ahead for governments. “Patchy, brilliant innovation has been accompanied by institutional amnesia, ad hockery and inability to stay the course,” he said. “Too often a change of government, a change of minister or razor gang in a tight budget has led to worthy initiatives being discontinued, useful organisations being abolished, or unproductive … No wonder episodes of Utopia are triggering for so many people in this town.” There are critical independent decisions to be made with the national interest in mind. As to our own little land use decision, we will hear this energy company out and weigh up the benefits and the costs. How do you want us to make these decisions? Would you like us to produce healthy food or energy for electrification or sequester carbon or save and build habitat or all of the above? Because, frankly Australia, I am confused.

Rumors on social media suggest that the attack was carried out to stop a local drag show. But officials have said a motive for the attack is unknown. Two power stations were struck with gunfire on Saturday at about 7pm eastern time, causing tens of thousands of residents to go without electricity, the Associated Press reported. The power outage affected Moore county, which is about two hours outside Charlotte. Authorities began investigating the outage as a crime after utility workers found signs of vandalism at the power grid, including evidence of gunfire at two substations, reported CNN. The Moore county sheriff, Ronnie Fields, described the investigation into the power outage during a Sunday news conference, reporting that “someone opened fire on the substation, the same thing with the other one”. Fields added that state investigators were also working with the FBI to find out who is responsible. “The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Fields said. But “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept that they’re the ones that done it”, Fields added, saying that officials are looking into different possibilities. As of Monday morning, almost 30,000 people were still without power, according to Duke Energy, an energy provider for the area. Local government officials have also acknowledged the attack. The North Carolina governor, Roy Cooper, spoke about the power grid’s targeting on Twitter, writing: “An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.” North Carolina state senator Tom McInnis called the attack a “terrible act” that seemed to be malicious, the New York Times reported. Authorities opened at least one shelter running on a power generator and imposed a nightly curfew after the outage, the Times added. Schools in the county were also closed on Monday. It wasn’t immediately clear how long it would be before campuses reopened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant approval faces legal challenge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/08/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-approval-faces-legal-challenge","fields":{"bodyText":"Campaigners have begun a legal challenge against the government’s decision to give the Sizewell C nuclear power station the go-ahead amid warnings that UK nuclear plants will be on the frontline of climate breakdown. Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK’s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: “The case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. “Even to consider building a £20bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.” The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK’s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: “It’s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.” Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as £1.7bn of taxpayers’ money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: “We are proud to represent TASC in the local community’s continued fight to help protect Suffolk’s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court’s attention.” The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. • This article was amended on 8 August 2022.

Speaking before senior Australian ministers meet their counterparts in the US this week, Hastie said Australia should seek one or two Virginia-class submarines off the US production line by the end of 2030. Hastie did not deny this may require Australia to subsidise the expansion of the US’s already-crowded production line, but said the strategic circumstances meant there was no time to waste. Authoritarian powers were “on the move” and it would take too long to start the flagship Aukus project with Australian domestic production, he said. “Too long, too long – and there’s too much risk in doing it on our own,” Hastie said. “We need to get a boat in the water, or two boats in the water, and at the same time be building the capacity here.” The opposition leader and former defence minister, Peter Dutton, has previously floated the idea of buying the first submarines from the US, but Hastie’s new comments strengthen those calls at a critical time. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Aukus will be at the top of the agenda when the defence minister, Richard Marles, and foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, hold annual talks with their US counterparts, Lloyd Austin and Antony Blinken, in Washington DC this week. Marles is also expected to join the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, on a visit to the site in Connecticut that builds nuclear submarines. Hastie called for “increased diplomatic engagement with the United States, not just across the legislature, but also through the bureaucracy”. “The US has been making nuclear subs for a long time, so this isn’t new to them. It is special to us – and you’ve really got to make sure our presence is known in Washington DC.” Hastie said it would make “total sense to get a boat or two off the production line into the water” this decade but this should not delay work to train Australian submarine crews and develop base facilities. “Simultaneously we should be building our industrial base as well, searching for talent at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels for people who will be part of this nation-building industry,” he said. Hastie cited the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s warnings that China was on track “to take action against Taiwan from sometime in the late 2020s or in 2030s”. Hastie said Australia needed options during this “Rudd window” including new missiles and unmanned platforms such as drones. “We need hard power, which gives us a deterrent against a would-be adversary. That means we need to be able to reach out and ring someone’s bell at distance and demonstrate risk in picking a fight with Australia,” he said. “I think that’s what Aukus will deliver when we get our nuclear submarines, but we also need to look at other strike capabilities, whether they be unmanned or manned platforms, both subsurface and surface.” Hastie said he was open minded about options that may be suggested by the defence strategic review conducted the former Australian defence force chief Angus Houston and the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith. “We want to work constructively with the government,” Hastie said. “Our mission is the same as theirs and that is to have a strong Australia that’s capable of resisting an aggressor.” Hastie said the war in Ukraine proved Australia also needed to strengthen its supply lines: “As a trading nation with the vast majority of our imports coming across the seas, we need to think about how we’re building our fuel stocks, our pharmaceutical stocks, and other essentials.” Australia, the US and the UK have set a March deadline for decisions on how Canberra’s plans for at least eight nuclear-powered powered submarines can be achieved. Any push for an offshore build, at least for the first couple of submarines, could be politically contentious in South Australia. The Labor premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, has said it would “not be acceptable” for his state to miss out on promised submarine manufacturing jobs. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to attend a meeting of the Aukus defence ministers in Washington DC later this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T00:00:20Z","webTitle":"As Liddell bites the dust, can NSW supply enough power for a looming El Niño summer peak?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/29/as-liddell-bites-the-dust-can-nsw-supply-enough-power-for-a-looming-el-nino-summer-peak","fields":{"bodyText":"AGL Energy’s Liddell coal-fired power station in New South Wales closed on Friday, Australia’s first big power plant closure since Hazelwood’s demise in Victoria in 2017. Liddell had been operating at less than half its original 2,000-megawatt capacity for some time. Still, its exit sharpens the focus on the challenges facing not only NSW but also the rest of the national electricity market (Nem). More closures to come Origin Energy’s black coal-fired Eraring power station is scheduled to be the next to shut, with a planned August 2025 closure. The plant, also in NSW, boasts almost 2,900MW of capacity, making it Australia’s largest. Relatively costly coal contracts, though, mean Eraring is not always raring to go. NSW’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, legislated by the state Coalition government in 2020, is intended to bridge the gap. It aims to attract at least 12 gigawatts of wind and solar farms and 2GW of long-duration storage by 2030. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup However, the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, says “the roadmap has already been tested by the delays in Snowy [Hydro’s 2.0 pumped storage project] and the foreshadowed possible closure of Eraring”. Snowy 2.0 is scheduled to be ready by December 2027 but more than a few – including in NSW – expect more delays. Officials say they expect to have sufficient new generation sources to fill the gaps left by Eraring. Early exits by any of the other plants, though, could stretch supplies. “The government’s approach will be to keep the lights on by getting as much renewable energy into operation as soon as possible, accelerating the roadmap where possible and working with coal-fired operators on their transition to ensure there is enough generation for households and businesses,” Sharpe said. Interstate competition NSW relies on Queensland and Victoria for about 10% of its power. Both states, however, have recently accelerated their own renewables rush, particularly in Queensland, a laggard in the decarbonisation shift. One NSW official said geographic spread should moderate the risks. “It’s really unusual in the [Nem] to have a peak demand event in multiple cities at the same time,” he said this week. Last June, however, saw a widespread cold snap across eastern states that pushed supplies to the brink. Flooding in coalmines and Covid-delayed maintenance at power plants exacerbated the strain, but a similar event this winter could test the grid, now that Liddell is shut and Queensland’s 825MW coal-fired Callide C plant remains out of action after an explosion. Historically, summer provides the peak of power demand and with the looming risk of a powerful El Niño the spike in usage might be particularly sharp later this year. Extra transmission links between states will help, such as the Project EnergyConnect between NSW and South Australia, expected by July 2026. Still, evidence of the ongoing constraints include curbs on existing lines that cut imports by NSW from Victoria by an average 138MW in the first quarter, the Australian Energy Market Operator said on Friday. Renewables (and storage) to the rescue? The great bulk of new investment in the electricity sector is directed to renewable energy since costs are well below alternatives, particularly nuclear, the CSIRO and Aemo say. More clean energy should bring down wholesale prices, as happened in the March quarter, Aemo said on Friday. Renewables now supply about 37% of the Nem’s power, a share that should rise to about 82% by 2030 according to federal goals. Victoria is banking on offshore windfarms to play a big role in supplying its energy. It also has set a target to have enough storage by 2035 to power half the state’s homes. However, the industry is warning that while about 5GW of new solar and windfarms started construction nationwide last year, not a lot of capacity was completed. The pipeline of new projects is also beginning to shrink. Stefan Jarnason, a co-founder of Solar Analytics and an industry veteran, said the NSW government considering an intervention to extend Eraring beyond 2025 will deter renewables investors. “As long as the government’s going ‘maybe we will or maybe we won’t close this 2GW coal-fired power station’, you’re gonna sit on your hands until they give you a firm signal,” he said. Better policy would be to make it easier for households to install rooftop solar – or expand what they have – and even add batteries. “We know that the largest source of new generation every year for the past five years has been rooftop solar and will likely continue to be for the next 30 years,” Jarnson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T18:01:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards Russian defence, say western officials – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the country’s deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov later claimed that Delimkhanov was alive and well. Kalibr missiles hit the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa at 2.40am on Wednesday, setting a warehouse, a business centre, an educational institution, restaurants and shops ablaze. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner’s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin’s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry – an order Prigozhin has refused to follow.

The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to a “dire humanitarian crisis” in flooded communities downstream, the United Nations in Ukraine has said. The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, was breached in the early hours of 6 June, allowing some of the 18 cubic kilometres of water it held back to surge down across a swathe of southern Ukraine. The damage resulting from the collapse has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people. The Ukrainian government has now requested the UN to help launch a post-disaster needs assessment that will look in depth at the long-term implications of the devastating destruction of the dam, the United Nations in Ukraine tweeted. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said that Adam Delimkhanov, one of his senior commanders, is alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messenger app on Wednesday that Delimkhanov was “alive and well and not even wounded”. Kadyrov added that he had known Delimkhanov was uninjured from the start of what he called “a fake information attack”, but had remained silent in order to embarrass Ukrainian media outlets which had reported on the commander’s alleged injury. There had been unconfirmed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Asked about the reports of Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, being injured, the Kremlin earlier on Wednesday said it was “worried” and was waiting for clarification about what had really happened (See post at 13:35). Russia appears to have doubled the number of trained dolphins defending Sevastopol naval base in Crimea, evidence seen by Naval News suggests. Analysis indicates the number of trained dolphins has increased from 3-4 to 6-7. This means dolphin patrols might have increased in frequency and have possibly been covering a wider area. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Kyiv’s Western backers will meet on Thursday at Nato headquarters in Brussels to get the latest update from Ukraine’s defence minister on the progress of the assaults, AFP reports. “The most obvious thing is to ensure they have the weapons, the supplies, the maintenance to continue to conduct the offensive,” Stoltenberg told journalists. He added that there was always recognition that Ukraine would suffer losses as it seeks to breach heavily fortified Russian lines. Stoltenberg said: There will be casualties, also, when it comes to modern Nato equipment. No one expected there to be zero casualties. The realities of this is fierce, fierce fighting. Ukrainian troops have advanced 200-500 meters at various sections of the front line around the small eastern city of Bakhmut and 300-350 meters in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Overnight, Russian missile attacks killed three people in the Black Sea city of Odesa and three in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. The officials’ sombre tone was clearly designed to lower expectations of a transformative breakthrough. However they nevertheless insisted the counteroffensive was “going in the right direction” and the losses were not unexpected. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces are forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. “The vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,” the officials said. The officials denied Ukraine had lost as many as 120 armoured vehicles – a figure touted by Moscow. One official said: “The Russian manoeuvre and defence approach is proving challenging for the Ukraine and costly to attacking forces hence the advance at the moment is slow”. The officials suggested there is likely to be “grinding costly warfare likely for many months to come. This is incredibly difficult. They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines. Whilst they are inflicting casualties on the Russians they are not significant because the Russians are choosing the time to withdraw in a manner similar to the way the Ukrainians defended themselves against Russian vehicles. “The idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people’s wildest dreams. “In this conflict the advantage has always been with the defender”. The officials said it may not be clear for as long as three months whether the offensive could be classified as a success. Most of the vehicles that have been damaged have been hit by mines. As the Ukrainians advance they are also more exposed to drone assaults. The officials played down suggestions that this assault was likely to give Ukraine a tactical advantage as early as September, and so give it space to reopen talks with Vladimir Putin. “We are a long way away from Ukraine being in a position to reopen negotiations”, the officials said. The slow progress is likely to place greater pressure on the west to signal to Putin that it is prepared for a long haul, and will not treat the counteroffensive as Ukraine’s one shot at reclaiming its territory. Ukraine has long feared support may decline in the west if the supply of western arms does not produce early tangible results. Western officials admitted that western-supplied jets may not be available in the short term, even if training of Ukrainian pilots is now underway. The officials also suggested Putin might have taken a truth serum before meeting military correspondents where he said Russia was suffering severe tank losses and suffering problems with its military industrial base. Even though there was still a huge amount of confusion about exact Russian deployment, the officials said the vast majority of Russian forces are now committed to positions on the line partly due to the sheer size of the line that has to be defended. That gave Russia little room for further manoeuvre to deploy reinforcements if a point in the line became vulnerable. By contrast Ukraine was holding back some of its heaviest armoury, including Challenger tanks. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has rebuffed growing international pressure on Ankara to ratify Sweden’s Nato membership bid before the western defence alliance meets in July. Western officials had hoped Erdoğan would soften his position on the diplomatically charged issue after he secured a hard-fought re-election last month (AFP reports). But Erdoğan signalled no major shift in comments released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Sweden and its Nordic neighbour Finland ended decades of military non-alignment and applied to join the US-led defence bloc in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey and fellow Nato member Hungary ratified Finland’s membership this year. But both countries’ parliaments have yet to approve Sweden’s entry. Turkey is pushing Sweden to ban and crack down on rallies by Kurdish supporters of a group recognised as a terrorist organisation by Ankara. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio, Reuters reports. In September 2022, several unexplained underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipelines that link Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate though they have yet to single out who was responsible. There has been an update on the fire that broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine (See post at 12:54). Citing reports, the Kyiv Independent tweeted that the fire was said to have started due to “non-compliance with safety precautions during repair work”. Here are some pictures of a local clean up effort in Odesa after a missile attack hit the southern Ukrainian city. The Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said on Wednesday it had voted to give its initial backing to legislation that would allow the defence ministry to sign contracts with suspected or convicted criminals to fight in Ukraine. More than 15 months into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to recruit more soldiers for Europe’s largest land conflict since the second world war. Under the proposed changes, a contract could be concluded with someone being investigated for committing a crime, or who is having their case heard in court, or who has been convicted – but before the verdict takes legal effect, according to the database of the Duma. People convicted of sexual crimes, treason, terrorism or extremism would not be able to sign up, Reuters reports. Those who do sign up would be exempt from criminal liability upon completion of their contract or if they receive awards for their combat prowess. The Wagner mercenary group was previously allowed to recruit convicts from prisons to fight in Ukraine, but said in February it had stopped. Prison rights activists say the defence ministry has taken over that process but wanted to make changes. The new changes being examined by the Duma do not cover recruitment of people already serving their sentences and the defence ministry has not commented. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened, Reuters reports. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine (See post at 10:32am). Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. Vladimir Putin will hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday with Cuba’s prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, the Kremlin said. Russia is seeking to bolster relations with Latin American, African and other non-western countries as the west tries to isolate and economically punish it for its invasion of Ukraine. Germany enshrined a Nato commitment to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence and identified Russia as the biggest threat to European security as the government announced its first ever National Security Strategy on Wednesday. Here are some of the highlights of Germany’s strategy outlined in a policy document and at a government press conference, as reported by Reuters: Russia is the biggest threat to peace in the Euro-Atlantic area Russia is trying to destabilise European democracies, weaken EU and Nato German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it is important to continue to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, including when the war ends Germany’s military budget was the seventh largest in the world last year behind the US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK. Nato members pledged in 2014 to move towards spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024. A fire broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region close to the border with Ukraine, state-owned news agency RIA reported. It did not say what had caused the blaze. Here is an update on the UN nuclear chief’s trip to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being delayed due to travel safety concerns (See post at 09:34). The head of Russian-installed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, also said the trip was delayed. “We will wait for Grossi at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 15 June, the visit is delayed by a day,” he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the trip had been pushed back, possibly by days, Reuters reports. Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-installed local official as saying Grossi would visit on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russian military forces of attacking a car near the two countries’ shared border, and killing six people. Writing on Telegram, Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said the attack happened on Tuesday in the Sumy region, in eastern Ukraine. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Moscow is yet to officially comment on the allegations. The International Committee on the Red Cross, under ferocious criticism from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitted the principles of neutrality under which it operates have been put under unprecedented strain by the Ukraine war. It also defended the quality of its response to the floods caused by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, saying it had been working tightly with the Ukrainian Red Cross to coordinate efforts to supply drinking water. Juerg Eglin, ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, also revealed that Russia was continuing to refuse to give the body access to the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, where the ICRC estimates that most of the 50,000 people affected by the floods are living. Refusing to share the Russian explanation for refusing to grant access since the discussions were not over, he said: “We are ready to intervene on both sides of the river and have made concrete requests.” The ICRC said hundreds of thousands had been affected in a different way upstream of the dam, and that the risk of mines was becoming a growing threat to the civilian population. He added that ICRC staff were working under the risk of shelling. More broadly, the ICRC said it had now visited 1,500 prisoners from both sides, and that the visits had led to improvements in conditions in Russia. It had also delivered 2,500 messages between prisoners and relatives. Defending the ICRC from Zelenskiy’s longstanding criticism, the organisation said the principles under which it operates were not always understood. Ariane Bauer, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and central Asia, said: “The current environment we are in is extremely mediatised. Our efforts are not always visible. Our discrete approach can sometimes seem out of sync with today’s realities of today’s information space. “Neutrality and trust remain central to meeting our objectives and they cannot be dissociated one from another. Remaining neutral means we stick to our principles – the very principles that help people that need our support. “Remaining neutral shows that we care for the mandate we were given by states that were signatory to the Geneva convention. We have seen neutrality under strain and misunderstood in this conflict and many others, but perhaps more in this than others. For us, neutrality is not a moral position, it is a tool that helps us work and get access to prisoners of war and populations in hard-to-reach areas.” She refused to comment on whether Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia were in worse conditions than Russians held in Ukraine, but said improvements in conditions in Russia had followed ICRC visits to Russia. Russia had also cooperated with the ICRC by setting up lists of named prisoners held under its authority, she said. The water receded by another 32cm in the Kherson Region, in southern Ukraine, overnight, but 28 de-occupied settlements are still flooded, the Kyiv Post cited the regional military administration as saying on Wednesday morning. In the early hours on Tuesday last week, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army’s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a “terrorist act”. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what it said was “extremely fierce” fighting Reuters reports. In a post on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said the Ukrainian actions had had “partial” success. In the past day, Ukrainian troops advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the small eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, she said. She reported continuing fighting near the village of Makarivka in the direction of the southern port city of Berdiansk, and said battles were raging in the areas of Novodanylivka and Novopokrovsk in the Mariupol direction. Maliar said: Our troops are moving in the face of extremely fierce fighting, and air and artillery superiority of the enemy. If you haven’t already seen it, this stark piece from our colleague Lorenzo Tondo is well worth a read … The war in Ukraine has driven the largest annual increase of people forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations in decades, according to the UN refugee agency. In 2022, the number of displaced people grew by 21%, standing at an estimated 108.4 million at the end of the year. That is likely have risen to more than 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia’s invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR. “These figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. Wagner chief reiterates refusal to sign contracts with Russian defence ministry Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin on Wednesday reiterated the refusal of his Wagner fighters to sign contracts with the defence ministry, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the agreements were needed. In a rare direct show of defiance towards the Russian leader, Prigozhin said: “None of Wagner’s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. That’s why they will not sign the contracts.” In a televised meeting on Tuesday, Putin backed a call by the defence ministry for “volunteer” fighters in Ukraine to sign contracts with the country’s military command, widely seen as a means to assert control over Wagner. Putin said that contracts were necessary to allow all participants in Russia’s campaign in Ukraine to receive the social support payments to which they are entitled. These include compensation to fighters if they are wounded, and to their families if they are killed in action. Prigozhin has waged a bitter public feud with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the army top brass since last year, accusing them of failing to provide adequate support and ammunition to Wagner forces in Ukraine and so causing them to suffer higher casualties. In Wednesday’s remarks, however, he said he thought a “compromise solution” would be found between Putin and parliament to enable Wagner fighters to receive social guarantees and certified status as combatants. (Via Reuters) More here on the missing Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov … Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has made a bizarre appeal for information from Ukrainian intelligence over the location of Adam Delimkhanov, his right hand man and a member of the Russian state Duma. The message on Kadyrov’s official Telegram account followed reports of a strike on Delimkhanov’s convoy in the Zaporizhzhia region which is at the heart of the Ukrainian counter offensive. Kadyrov writes: “I myself can’t find Adam Delimkhanov in any way. He doesn’t get in touch. I ask Ukrainian intelligence to provide information on exactly what place and what positions were hit, so that I can still find my dear BROTHER. I promise a generous reward and I ask you to help.” Russia’s defence ministry quoted the State Duma as confirming Delimkhanov had been injured but they provided no further information. Kyrylo Sazonov, a Ukrainian military blogger, has claimed on his Facebook account that Delimkhanov was killed in an attack near the city of Prymorsk, west of Mariupol, after Ukrainian intelligence had spotted a motorcade of SUVs. He writes: “There were no wounded... All the bodies were taken away by helicopters. They arrived in half an hour.” Senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces in Ukraine has been wounded – report A senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine has been wounded, Russia’s defence ministry television channel Zvezda reported on Wednesday, citing the press service of the state Duma, the lower house of parliament. Adam Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. In a message posted on Telegram, Kadyrov wrote that he could not contact Delimkhanov, and asked for help finding his “dear brother”. Delimkhanov, a former Chechen separatist who eventually switched sides to Moscow along with much of the region’s leadership, had taken a prominent role in Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, commanding Chechen forces in Mariupol in the conflict’s early days. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian media reported that Delimkhanov had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. (Via Reuters) Reuters has a useful explainer on the Russian tactical nuclear weapons that are to be stationed in Belarus, and which the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, mentioned earlier (see here). Putin said that “tactical” nuclear weapons – so called as they are designed for battlefield use – would be sent to Belarus, but did not say exactly which warheads would be deployed or where. Lukashenko said the warheads were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Hiroshima bomb, made from highly enriched uranium-235, was about 16 kilotons (equivalent to 16,000 tonnes of TNT), while the Nagasaki bomb, made from plutonium-239, was about 21 kilotons, according to the World Nuclear Association. If Lukashenko is correct, the Russian warheads would have a yield of about 48 to 63 kilotons each. Russia has about 1,816 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to analysis of Russia’s nuclear weapons by Bulletin of Atomic Scientists magazine. Putin said Iskander mobile short-range ballistic missiles, which can deliver nuclear warheads, had already been handed over to Belarus. Russian sources say the Iskander has a range of 500km (310 miles). Putin also said 10 Belarusian aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. Belarus said Su-25 aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. The Sukhoi-25 jet has a range of up to 1,000km (621 miles), according to Russian sources. The Federation of American Scientists has said the weapons could be based at Lida airbase, 40km (25 miles) from the Lithuanian border. If so, the delivery vehicles could reach most of Ukraine, almost all of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, a swathe of Germany, as well as some of Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Cities such as Berlin and Stockholm would be in range. Putin said Russia would finish the construction of a special storage facility in Belarus on 7-8 July and that the weapons would be deployed soon afterwards. Lukashenko has made different comments. He seemed to indicate last month that the weapons were already on the move while on 13 June he said the weapons would be deployed in “several days”. He has also said that there could be “nuclear weapons for everyone” who joined the Russia-Belarus union. In a video published on 14 June, Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Germany is aiming to reduce its dependence on commodities through diversification of supply, and to create incentives for firms to hold strategic reserves, according to a summary of its new national security strategy. The strategy, which is expected to be published in full later on Wednesday, comes a year and a half after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which exposed Germany’s reliance on Russia for energy. It also contains a commitment for Germany to spend an average of 2% of economic output on defence, according to the summary – a weaker pledge, however, than the one made by chancellor Olaf Scholz days after the Russian invasion in a landmark speech heralding a “turning of era” or Zeitenwende in German foreign policy. Scholz had said Germany would start to invest more than 2% of economic output on defence, up from about 1.5%, after years of resisting pleas from Nato allies to do so. (Via Reuters) Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, has shared a video which purports to be an interview with a woman who was trapped under rubble after a Russian strike overnight, whose husband did not survive the attack. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. Grossi had been expected to visit the facility on Wednesday after talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, but a diplomatic source said the visit would be delayed by “some hours”. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-imposed local official as saying Grossi would visit the plant on Thursday. “He’s waiting to be able to travel safely,” said the senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official did not say when Grossi would arrive at the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Here are some more images from the news wires showing the damage in Odesa, where at least three people have been killed and 13 wounded. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio. Reuters reports that Mats Ljungqvist, the prosecutor leading the Swedish investigation, told Swedish Radio he had met the German prosecutor and that they were working together but declined to give further details. “I hope that we at least this autumn will be able to make a decision regarding indictments, at least that is the ambition as things stand now,” Ljungqvist told Swedish public service broadcaster SR. “I think, actually, in time, [who carried out the sabotage] will be brought to light.” Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group. Ljungqvist told Reuters in April that the main scenario was that a state or a state-backed group was behind the attack. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reports, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva. Navalny, Putin’s best-known opponent, is serving sentences totalling more than 11 years in a penal colony for fraud and other charges that he says were trumped up to silence him. He faces further “extremism” charges that could extend his term by decades. Human rights groups and western governments view Navalny as a political prisoner. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has used the strike on Odesa to reiterate Ukraine’s frequent calls for a tightening of economic sanctions on Russia. In a post on Telegram, he said: The Russians shelled the city with Kalibr cruise missiles. Civilians died. Each of these missiles has at least 40 foreign components. Without microelectronics, Russia will not be able to produce them. Sanctions must be strengthened, in particular, against those who help the terrorist country to obtain components for weapons. A planned visit by the UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been delayed by “some hours”, a diplomatic source has told Reuters. No reason has been given for the delay. Suspilne reports that the number of people killed due to the rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday has increased to 12. Citing the city authority, it said a 67-year-old wounded man died in the hospital overnight. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and currently deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has said on Telegram that Russia needs to put in a demilitarised zone as far west as Ukraine’s Lviv, which he referred to by its Russian name Lvov and German name Lemberg. He went on to say that, as a result of the Nord Stream sabotage, for which he cited “western complicity”, that Russia should have “no restrictions left to refrain from destroying the cable communications of our enemies, laid along the ocean floor”. Here are some images released by the emergency services in Ukraine showing the aftermath of strikes in Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region. Three people have been killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. It cites the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. He stated that the attack happened at 5am local time (3am BST). The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It claims: In the last two weeks, there has been an uptick in Russian tactical combat air sorties, especially over southern Ukraine. This has almost certainly been in response to reports of increased Ukrainian offensive operations, as the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) attempt to support ground troops with airstrikes. Despite the uptick, VKS’ daily sortie rate remains much lower than the peak of up to 300 daily missions early in the war. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Russian-installed administrators of Nova Kakhovka have accused Ukrainian forces of shelling a residential area in the city, injuring one person. Last week the Kakhovka dam in the city was destroyed, flooding swaths of land and forcing thousands to flee one of the biggest environmental disasters in Europe for decades. The administration also said that shelling of the nearby village of Plodovoye disrupted power supply there. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Ukraine and Russia deny targeting civilians in their military operations. Each side has accused the other of shelling the flooded areas in the aftermath of the dam blast. Separately, the administration said 7,200 people had been evacuated from the flooded areas in the past week, including 421 children. – Reuters The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. On Tuesday, Lukashenko said “everything is ready” for the Russian nuclear weapons’ deployment, adding that “it could take just a few days for us to get what we had asked for and even a bit more”. Asked later by a Russian state TV host whether Belarus had already received some of the weapons, Lukashenko responded: “Not all of them, little by little.” He appeared to confirm that his government had taken possession of some weapons from Russia and added that they were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. God forbid I have to make a decision to use those weapons today, but there would be no hesitation if we face an aggression. But in a later media appearance on Russian TV on Tuesday, he clarified he would consult with Putin before using any of the weapons. Listen, if a war starts, do you think I will look around? I pick up the phone, and wherever he is, he picks it up. If he calls, I pick it up any time. It’s no problem at all to coordinate launching a strike. Russian officials had no immediate comment on Lukashenko’s remarks. – AP The International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to “make his own assessment” on the risks posed to the operation by the war in Ukraine. Before his site visit, Grossi met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night to discuss the issue after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which formed a reservoir that provided cooling water for the plant. Speaking to journalists before his visit, Grossi said the situation complicated “an already precarious nuclear safety and security situation”. It is a step in the wrong direction, it is yet another step in the weakening of the safety net that one has in any nuclear power plant. Grossi said he would assess the integrity of the station’s water channels and cooling pond, and clarify whether the pond has been mined. I would say – again without having visited and on the basis of what my team there is informing me – there will be water (in the pond) for a few weeks, or maybe a month or two. There is no immediate situation: there is water there, but it could be going down. He also said that even if the reservoir empties “there are alternatives” such as pumping in water or drilling for groundwater. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. The warehouse of a retail chain was also hit in the attack, causing a fire to break out. Work is under way to clear the debris and a search is taking place for people trapped under the rubble. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured during a missile attack on the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Authorities say the attack struck civilian infrastructure in the southern port city and work is under way to pick through the rubble in the search for survivors. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss risks to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant before a planned visit to the facility. After the meeting, Grossi told journalists that he planned to travel to the plant on Wednesday so he could “make [his] own assessment” as to “what kind of danger we have”. Zelenskiy has praised the courage of Ukrainian troops during the early stages of his country’s counteroffensive and singled out units operating near the besieged city of Bakhmut, saying: “There is forward movement in various areas.” Zelenskiy also praised several other units, thanking them “for your strength”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed that Ukrainian losses during the conflict were near “catastrophic” and that the counterattack had not been successful in any area. The Russian president made the claim during televised meetings with war correspondents and military bloggers. “This is a massive counteroffensive, using strategic reserves that were prepared for this task,” Putin said. “They lost over 160, we lost 54 tanks, and some of them are subject to restoration and repair.” In other news: Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country won’t hesitate to use Russian nuclear weapons in the event his country is threatened with repression. The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously on a resolution calling for Russia to immediately release the imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Moscow has flagged that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin said he had been cheated by the west, who had failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets. A Russian missile strike on a block of flats in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine has killed 11 and injured more than 30 people, according to an updated casualty list provided by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. The US president, Joe Biden, has met Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg before a major meeting of the alliance next month in Lithuania where questions about Ukraine’s membership are expected to be addressed. The US government has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $325m which includes artillery rounds, anti-aircraft systems and 15 new Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The UK Ministry of Defence has announced a $115m air defence package for Ukraine. Latvia has allocated another $460,000 in aid to Ukraine after the Kakhova dam disaster. Ukrainian forces have been confirmed to have liberated the village of Neskuchne on Tuesday after Reuters journalists were able to reach the area. Russia has not yet acknowledge any gains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T12:00:37Z","webTitle":"Absolute power, misconduct and decline: the classical music pieces that unlock Tár","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/jan/20/classical-music-tar-cate-blanchett-todd-field","fields":{"bodyText":"Earlier this month, director Todd Field was interviewed for Radio 3’s Private Passions about his new film, Tár. The presenter Michael Berkeley had seen it the night before and commented: “It’s the kind of film you want to see with friends and have a good argument about. Is that perhaps what you wanted?” Field replied with a confident “yes” before bursting into laughter. At its root, Tár is a study of power. Field might have conjured up a ruthless politician to make his film about, but he chose to go one step higher – picking a figure of absolutism. It features Cate Blanchett in imperious form playing Lydia Tár, the first female chief conductor of one of the world’s top orchestras, the Berlin Philharmonic. A real-life predecessor of the fictional Tár was Herbert von Karajan, who held the helm at the Berlin Philharmonic from 1956 until his death in 1989. Margaret Thatcher admired him greatly and they became friends, no matter that he was a former Nazi party member. “She envied me,” Karajan once said, “that people always did what I requested.” Much is left unsaid in Tár, resulting in a great deal of critical analysis. With regards to the music in the film – or, more specifically, the two works that Lydia Tár intends to conduct with her orchestra – there’s plenty to stew on, too. We hear in an opening scene that she intends to complete a cycle of Mahler’s nine symphonies (10 if you count his unfinished last symphony) by recording a live version of the Fifth. Needing a work to perform on the night alongside the Mahler, she opts for Elgar’s Cello Concerto, allowing her to promote her latest grooming victim, the young Russian cellist Olga Metkina (played by Sophie Kauer), from orchestra newbie to soloist. Tár seems to follow its protagonist’s descent from supreme power to near-irrelevance, her career and private life destroyed by a slew of allegations of misconduct. So why put Mahler’s Fifth at the heart of this psychodrama? Field told the LA Times that it was his “gateway drug into a lot of classical music”, but also that it fitted his narrative. Written in 1901–1902 and premiered in 1904, it’s a five-movement work beginning with a funeral march. “The first movement of the five is about death, and Lydia is undergoing a sort of artistic death, a personal death and a potential rebirth,” Field added. “It’s almost like it’s haunting her, coming for her.” The first movement alone clocks in at 12 or 13 minutes. In the film, there’s much discussion about the different lengths at which conductors play the famous fourth movement, the Adagietto (anywhere between seven and 12 minutes). In total, the symphony runs for well over an hour, pulling in many sonic and thematic directions. It’s a wide-open work, ripe for individual interpretation and impeccably suiting a film that doesn’t provide easy answers. Mahler said: “A symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.” He was caught on the cusp of the Romantic period in music and the forward charge of modernism. His symphonies both look back and drive onward, creating ambiguity, consciously and subconsciously. “Music, before Mahler, had a lexicon of simple emotions: joy, sorrow, love, hate, uplift, downcast, beauty, ugliness, and so on,” music critic Norman Lebrecht wrote in his 2010 book, Why Mahler? “Mahler, in his First Symphony, introduced the possibility of parallel meanings.” Mahler met and married his wife Alma, also a composer, while writing his Fifth symphony. The Adagietto is his love letter, but that’s not how it’s always perceived. In the film, Lydia Tár is portrayed as the protege of the American conductor Leonard Bernstein. In 1968, Bernstein conducted the Adagietto at Robert F Kennedy’s funeral – performing it like “a mass’’, as Tár says – which began the process of it becoming an American national anthem of mourning. Post-9/11, it was played repeatedly by orchestras and radio DJs across the US. After her brother-in-law’s funeral, Jackie Kennedy wrote to Bernstein: “When your Mahler started to fill (but that is the wrong word – because it was more this sensitive trembling) the cathedral today – I thought it was the most beautiful music I had ever heard. I am so glad I didn’t know it – it was this strange music of all the gods who were crying …” Such is the power of Mahler’s Fifth, a piece that becomes reborn each time new listeners stumble upon it. Field told Private Passions that the first time he heard the work he thought he’d “personally discovered it”. Mikhail Gorbachev, who first heard it in 1991, commented: “I had the feeling that Mahler’s music somehow touched our situation, about the period of perestroika with all its passions and struggles.” It’s an irony of both Mahler’s Fifth and Elgar’s Cello Concerto (1919) that they barely resonated when composed, percolated over time and then came into dazzling fruition in the 1960s. Bernstein was essential to Mahler’s success in the second half of the 20th century; Elgar has an English cellist, Jacqueline du Pré, to thank for turning a failure into a standard. Her electrifying, boundless 1965 performance of the concerto – recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by John Barbirolli when Du Pré was 20 – transcended genre. It hit the zeitgeist, sold like a pop record and made a star of Du Pré. Her death in 1987, aged 42, after multiple sclerosis had ended her performing career 14 years earlier, remains one of English classical music’s most appalling tragedies. In Tár, the blackly comic character of Olga Metkina says she was introduced to the Elgar Cello Concerto by Du Pré, but through a live performance on YouTube, not the recording. There is a correlation between the free-spirited natures of Metkina and Du Pré, but you guess also that Field specifically needed Elgar’s Cello Concerto in his film. Like Mahler’s Fifth, it’s a wildly popular piece frequently used by Hollywood, thereby providing a reachable access point for anyone new to classical music. But perhaps there’s further intent on Field’s part. Like Tár, whose affection for the old masters is scoffed at by progressive students in a class she teaches at New York’s Juilliard school, so Elgar was written off as stuffy, reactionary and provincial – later in his own career and in the decades that followed his death in 1934. By the time Elgar began writing his Cello Concerto in the aftermath of the first world war, he was already considered old-hat and he knew it. Furthermore, the carnage of war had affected him deeply and his beloved wife Alice was ill (she would soon die). He was lonely, depressed and he wouldn’t go on to write another major orchestral work. Later, when preparing a catalogue of his music, he wrote “Finis RIP” next to the Concerto, although he lived for 15 more years and published many more, smaller pieces. The plaintive, autumnal concerto is considered to be a lament for war, but perhaps Elgar was writing a requiem for his own death. In that sense, it couldn’t more perfectly suit Field’s narrative arc for Lydia Tár as she unwittingly orchestrates her own demise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T19:26:57Z","webTitle":"Dykes scores hat-trick on league debut as London Irish power past Harlequins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jan/29/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report","fields":{"bodyText":"London Irish already have an impressive roster of exciting young English-qualified talent and another name can now be added to the list. Michael Dykes has plenty of good rugby ahead of him but an alert hat-trick of tries on his Premiership debut ensured he overshadowed even the fit-again Henry Arundell on a highly encouraging day for the Exiles. There are fruit machines that revolve slower than the helter-skelter games in which Irish specialise but here there was also a decent pay-out to enjoy as they bolstered their chances of a top-four finish with a convincing bonus-point victory. If a first-half red card for the Quins captain, Stephan Lewies, significantly shaped the contest, the hosts fully deserved their six-try success. Along with the energy of the 21-year-old Dykes, who is from Berkshire and has already represented England at age-group level, the sight of Arundell back on a rugby field for the first time since late October was another clear plus for the Exiles in a season which has too often involved narrow defeats and red cards. England, with Henry Slade now out with a hip injury, have recalled Leicester’s Anthony Watson to their Six Nations squad but the Irish head coach, Les Kiss, suggested Arundell would also be ready if and when he is required. “I wouldn’t be afraid to throw him in,” Kiss said. “The boy’s got something special.” Here, too, was a glimpse of what might yet be possible this season for Irish, who have now won four of their past five Premiership games. If a nasty-looking shoulder injury for the unlucky Adam Coleman was a blow, the obvious talent of the the Kiwi-reared Chandler Cunningham-South, still just 19 and part of England’s under-20 squad, Tom Pearson and their Argentinian replacement Juan Martin González bodes well for their play-off prospects. This was the Exiles’ biggest attendance of the season and once the grounds harden up in spring their attacking brand of rugby should be even more watchable. There was also the satisfaction of atoning for their last-gasp defeat against Quins at the end of October with the third-placed Exeter now only three points above them. As well as underlining the competitiveness of this year’s Premiership it also raised further questions about how Quins will fare over the Six Nations period without Marcus Smith and Alex Dombrandt to steer them around the field. “We’re a mid-table side, that’s the brutal reality,” the Quins director of rugby, Tabai Matson, said. Matson also did not dispute the 22nd-minute red card against Lewies, who on the face of it could have no complaints under the laws. His shoulder to the head of a stooping Cunningham-South looked worse with every slow-motion replay and there was no attempt to wrap the arm. Then again, tacklers are not technically supposed to have their heads below waist level, leaving the Quins captain with no real legal target at which to aim. So what was he meant to do? Matson is among those who believe this is the biggest conundrum now facing rugby’s beleaguered guardians. Dykes’s triple whammy, meanwhile, made him only the third player after Gloucester’s Lesley Vainokolo and Northampton’s Courtnal Skosan to score a hat-trick on his Premiership debut. Swift, elusive and with an eye for the line, Dykes had his first try on the board after just seven minutes, courtesy of some slick work inside him, as Quins went 14-0 down quicker than you could say “Not another slow start”. In addition to Cunningham-South’s early score, James Stokes was first to react to a loose ball to register Irish’s third before Dykes, having also served 10 minutes in the sin-bin for failing to intercept a looping ball which also led to a penalty try being awarded, underlined the promise he had shown previously with a hat-trick in a Premiership Cup game against Saracens. Even before Joe Marler departed to the sin-bin, leaving Quins with just 13 players for the final 10 minutes, it was a green day to savour."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"}]}}
