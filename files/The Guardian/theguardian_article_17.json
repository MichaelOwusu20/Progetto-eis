The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-30T17:10:36Z","webTitle":"Risk of extinction by AI should be global priority, say experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/may/30/risk-of-extinction-by-ai-should-be-global-priority-say-tech-experts","fields":{"bodyText":"A group of leading technology experts from across the world have warned that artificial intelligence technology should be considered a societal risk and prioritised in the same class as pandemics and nuclear wars. The statement, signed by hundreds of executives and academics, was released by the Center for AI Safety on Tuesday amid growing concerns over regulation and risks the technology posed to humanity. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said. Signatories included the chief executives of Google’s DeepMind, the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and the AI startup Anthropic. Global leaders and industry experts – such as the leaders of OpenAI – have made calls for regulation of the technology owing to existential fears it could significantly affect job markets, harm the health of millions and weaponise disinformation, discrimination and impersonation. This month the man often touted as the godfather of AI – Geoffrey Hinton, also a signatory – quit Google citing its “existential risk”. The risk was echoed and acknowledged by No 10 last week for the first time – a swift change of tack within government that came two months after publishing an AI white paper industry figures have warned is already out of date. While the letter published on Tuesday is not the first, it is potentially the most impactful given its wider range of signatories and its core existential concern, according to Michael Osborne, a professor in machine learning at the University of Oxford and co-founder of Mind Foundry. “It really is remarkable that so many people signed up to this letter,” he said. “That does show that there is a growing realisation among those of us working in AI that existential risks are a real concern.” AI’s potential to exacerbate existing existential risks such as engineered pandemics and military arms races are concerns that led Osborne to sign the public letter, along with AI’s novel existential threats. Calls to curb threats follow the success of ChatGPT, which launched in November. The language model has been widely adopted by millions of people and rapidly advanced beyond predictions by those best informed in the industry. Osborne said: “Because we don’t understand AI very well there is a prospect that it might play a role as a kind of new competing organism on the planet, so a sort of invasive species that we’ve designed that might play some devastating role in our survival as a species.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-28T17:30:34Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on nuclear warfare: dialogue or destruction | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/28/the-guardian-view-on-nuclear-warfare-dialogue-or-destruction","fields":{"bodyText":"When the most senior figure in Britain’s defence and security establishment warns of the increased risk of accidental nuclear war, the rest of us should pay attention. Even today, when security chiefs speak more often in public than they once did, they still ration their pronouncements. So when the UK’s national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, speaks in Washington about a breakdown in communications with Russia and China causing an enhanced risk of “rapid escalation to strategic conflict”, as he did this week, those words should be taken very seriously indeed. The increased international danger is starkly obvious. Russia’s deliberate invasion of Ukraine, its use there of hypersonic Kinzhal weapons and its threats of further escalation involving its nuclear arsenal add up to the most destabilising repertoire of state-on-state aggression in modern Europe since 1945. In Asia, China’s increasingly bellicose postures over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, its intensive nuclear missile development programmes and its disdain towards arms control agreements raise the stakes much higher. Iran and North Korea, where Kim Jong-un appears to be preparing the country’s first nuclear test for five years, add further to the current volatility. Sir Stephen warned that what is happening is not a return to the nuclear tensions of the cold war. In those days, he argued, Nato and the Soviet Union by and large understood one another’s military doctrines of deterrence, containment and the avoidance of first nuclear weapon use. That is not the case today. Nuclear doctrine is opaque, and possibly different, in Moscow and Beijing, never mind in Pyongyang. The conditions for instability are therefore greater, either through deliberate acts or miscalculations. Although Sir Stephen did not say so, this environment could trigger a flawed and fateful western response, not just an act of aggression by one of the west’s adversaries. Western faith in dialogue with hostile rivals has been massively damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A similar confrontation with China over Taiwan would shatter confidence still further. But Sir Stephen is right to say that all sides must continue to look for ways of conducting dialogue. Some foundations are better than none at all. For that reason alone, it is helpful that Joe Biden and Xi Jinping were holding their first conversation in many months on Thursday. The expected start of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York next week is potentially another confidence-building development in a crucial area. In spite of all the obvious difficulties, arms control remains an indispensable means of tackling the current volatility. The key role in the west will continue to be played by the United States. But Britain is not currently doing its bit. Boris Johnson prefers to grandstand as a fancy dress war leader. Liz Truss is doing a Margaret Thatcher tribute act in the hope of becoming his successor. Rishi Sunak is afraid of saying anything for fear of the Tory right. This week, though, the Commons defence committee accused the government of being “arrogant and unwilling to learn the lessons” of its defence errors, including in Ukraine, while an Institute for Government report describes the Foreign Office as understaffed, with low morale and expertise on Russia continuing to be downgraded. Sir Stephen Lovegrove’s Washington speech may be a welcome piece of strategic thinking at the heart of government. But the people who most need to get his message are the British ministers for whom he works. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Below is a round-up of today’s events. Anti-Kremlin militia claims to have overrun Russian border settlement in Belgorod. Fighting broke out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launching a cross-border raid, claiming to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. 12 northern European countries met to discuss stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. Defence ministers from the Northern Group met in Poland on Monday where talks described as “very good” by the Polish defence minister were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. The Labour leader also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets” and said “whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, has tweeted out his nightly address where he claims Ukraine’s air defence systems have shot down “25 out of 25” Russian drones between Sunday night and Monday morning. The Associated Press reports that defence ministers and senior officials from 12 northern European countries met in Poland on Monday to talk about stepping up deterrence and security on Nato’s eastern flank and strengthening Ukraine’s defences. They gathered near Warsaw as part of the Northern Group, a platform for developing security initiatives for Nato and European Union members. Members of the Northern Group include Britain, Germany, Poland and Finland. After the meeting, Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, said the “very good” talks were focused on coordinating ways of providing security to countries in the group. He underscored good cooperation with Britain and Sweden, saying the two countries have similar views on threats coming from Russia as it wages war on Ukraine. “We are looking for joint solutions to ensure security,” Błaszczak said. He said Poland’s efforts to obtain early warning planes from Sweden were moving forward. Officials also discussed preparations for the July Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Poland’s proposals for it, Błaszczak said. That summit is expected to gauge prospects for Ukraine’s membership. There have been eight injuries and no deaths as a result of the shelling in the Graivoronsky district in Belgorod, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor for the region, has said during a live broadcast on the Russian social media network VKontakte. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod governor, has introduced emergency counter-terrorism mesasures, according to this message on Telegram: “In order to ensure the safety of citizens in the Belgorod region, the legal regime of the counter-terrorist operation has been introduced today, which establishes special measures and temporary restrictions. “Starting with the verification of documents proving their identity and ending with the suspension of the activities of hazardous industries and organisations that use explosive, radioactive, chemically and biologically hazardous substances.” Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer have both reaffirmed their support for Ukraine in the UK’s House of Commons this afternoon. Starmer said: “As I told President Zelenskiy when I met him in Kyiv, whichever party is in power in the UK, there will be no letup in Britain’s resolve. We will continue to support Ukraine’s military and its people in its quest for freedom, peace and justice.” He also noted that Labour “[welcomes] the decision by our partners on F-16 fighter jets”. Starmer also urged the prime minister to proscribe the Wagner group as terrorists and “to ensure Britain’s sanctions are not just in place, but enforced”. Speaking beforehand, Sunak said: “When Putin launched his war he gambled that our resolve would falter, but he was wrong then and he is wrong now. “Russia’s military is failing on the battlefield; their economy is failing at home as we tighten the stranglehold on sanctions; and the image of the G7 leaders standing shoulder to shoulder with President Zelenskiy in Hiroshima sent a powerful message to the world: we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.” “Putin should know that we are not going anywhere.” The Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has accused the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, of personally ordering the illegal transfer of Ukrainian orphans and suggested he may be guilty of war crimes. Tsikhanouskaya, who lives in exile in Lithuania, said “ample evidence” had been gathered indicating the “direct involvement” of Lukashenko and his regime in the deportation of Ukrainian children from territories occupied by Russia to Belarus. “Alexander Lukashenko personally ordered the transfers of orphans to Belarus and facilitated their arrival by financial and organisational support,” states a report Tsikhanouskaya sent to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU foreign ministers. Tsikhanouskaya’s team estimates that at least 2,150 children will have been brought to Belarus by the end of this month. Some have been sent to the Dubrava camp in the Minsk region, which is said to be run by Belaruskali, a state-owned potash company and major source of revenue for the Lukashenko regime. The charge sheet against Lukashenko and Belaruskali comes amid growing pressure on the EU to tighten up sanctions against Belarus. The EU has already imposed sanctions on Belarus, including Belaruskali, both for its role in supporting the Russian invasion and the brutal crackdown on protesters after the 2020 elections. However, an extension of the sanctions has been held up for months over the question of whether Belaruskali should be granted an exemption in the name of food security. The European Commission had proposed an exemption for Belaruskali in a belief it would ease global food shortages. Lithuania, backed by Poland, Estonia and Hungary, is refusing to sign off sanctions if an exemption for Belaruskali is included. Vilnius argues that the market is adapting to provide alternatives to Belarusian potash. “It’s our duty not to fall into the trap of Russian propaganda. No lack of fertilisers [and] sanctions against Russia doesn’t cause food insecurity,” the Lithuanian foreign ministry tweeted on Monday. Andrew Roth, the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, has this roundup of what we know so far about the incident on Belgorod: Fighting has broken out along the Russian border with Ukraine after self-described Russian partisan forces launched a cross-border raid and claimed to have overrun a border settlement for the first time in the war. The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. “We are the same Russians as you,” said a statement put out by the group on social media. “We are distinguished only by the fact that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals in power and took up arms to defend our and your freedom. But today it’s time for everyone to take responsibility for their future. It’s time to put an end to the Kremlin’s dictatorship.” Other video posted to social media showed a Russian Mi-8 helicopter trailing flares over the town of Kozinka and videos of smoke rising from the settlement with the sounds of emergency sirens clearly audible. The governor of the Belgorod region confirmed an attack on Monday, writing that “sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine have entered the territory of the Grayvoron district. The armed forces of the Russian Federation, together with the border service, Rosgvardiya and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Ukraine has disavowed connection to the Russian partisan fighters, saying that they act independently and are not subject to military control. The head of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has posted another update to Telegram about the outbreak of fighting inside Russia. He wrote: There are three more victims in Grayvoron – two men and one woman with shrapnel wounds, they are in the hospital in a state of moderate severity. All necessary medical assistance is provided. The shells also damaged three private residential buildings, as a result of which they caught fire. There is also a hit on the administration building. In the village of Zamostye, a shell hit a kindergarten, causing it to catch fire. There is also an injured woman with a hand wound, assistance was provided on the spot. Damage information is being updated. Here is what Russian state-owned media Tass is reporting as what it knows about events in Belgorod: The head of the Belgorod region Vyacheslav Gladkov reported about the penetration of Ukrainian saboteurs into the Grayvoron district. He clarified that the Russian military, border guards, as well as employees of the National Guard and the FSB are taking “the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy.” Prior to this, the governor reported two victims of shelling in the village of Glotovo, Graivoronsky district. According to him, a woman with mine-explosive wounds was taken to intensive care in a serious condition, the man’s condition is assessed as moderate. Later, the Kremlin confirmed that a Ukrainian sabotage group tried to break into the Belgorod region, now it is being squeezed out of Russian territory and destroyed. There are enough forces and means on the spot to fight saboteurs, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation, told reporters. He clarified that Putin was informed about the incident. Peskov said that the purpose of the sabotage was “to divert attention from the Bakhmut direction, to minimize the political effect of the loss. Christopher Miller, covering the conflict for the FT, has suggested on Twitter that “Ukrainian incursions into poorly defended Russian settlements along the border could be part of the counteroffensive strategy to keep the Kremlin off balance.” The situation in Belgorod region remains unclear. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has published on its Telegram channel what it says is a message from the Freedom of Russia Legion. They claim to be participating in an attack inside the Russian Federation’s borders. Suspilne writes: “The situation is difficult” in the Belgorod region, the press service of the Freedom of Russia Legion informed us. They said that the Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps are creating a demilitarized zone on the border with the Russian Federation, from where the Russian army will not be able to fire at Ukraine. According to them, they will continue to “move towards the liberation of all of Russia.” The Kremlin has claimed that Ukraine is behind the incursion. Ukrainian officials have denied this. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. The report comes after the plant lost external power today for the seventh time during the conflict. The Post says that the plan being pushed by the director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, has five main points: According to two diplomats familiar with the negotiations, Grossi’s plan includes five principles: a ban on stationing heavy military equipment and military personnel at the plant; a ban on firing from and toward the plant, including a ban on attacking the personnel at the site; protection of all safety and security systems at the plant; protection of all external power lines; and monitoring of compliance of the above-mentioned principles. The Post notes that this appears to be less ambitious than Grossi’s previous proposal of a protection zone around the plant. The plant has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of the war, and the Russian Federation has claimed to annex the Zaporizhzhia region, despite not fully controlling the territory. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has distanced Ukraine from events in Belgorod, where there are reports of an armed incursion into Russian territory. He wrote on Twitter: The only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement. Ukraine is watching the events in the Belgorod region of Russia with interest and studying the situation, but it has nothing to do with it. As you know, tanks are sold at any Russian military store, and underground guerrilla groups are composed of Russian citizens. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of staging an incursion to distract from the Russian claim to have seized full control of Bakhmut at the weekend. Here are some pictures of the destruction caused overnight by what Ukraine claims were Russian strikes in Dnipro city in south-eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian army, Russian forces targeted the Dnipro with 16 missiles and 20 attack drones. The Russian state-owned Tass news agency has reported on its Telegram feed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has been informed about what is claimed to be an attempt to infiltrate the Belgorod region by Ukrainian forces. Citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, it posted: The ministry of defence, the FSB and the border service reported to Putin about an attempt by Ukrainian saboteurs to break into the Belgorod region, Peskov said. The purpose of the Ukrainian sabotage in the Belgorod region is to divert attention from the situation in the Bakhmut direction, he noted. Russian forces are working to squeeze out the Ukrainian saboteur group from the territory of the Russian Federation and destroy it. There are enough forces and means, the press secretary of the president of the Russian Federation added. Reuters reports that Ukraine’s military intelligence service has blamed an armed operation in Belgorod on Russian citizens belonging to two paramilitary groups, Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske said. It quoted military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov as saying the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps were responsible for the operation. Tass identified the territory of the Graivoronsky district as the location for the incident. None of the claims have been independently verified. Reuters reports that Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, claimed on Monday that a Ukrainian army “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory in the Graivoron district, which borders Ukraine. On Telegram, Gladkov claimed the Russian army and security forces were taking measures to fight off the incursion. “A sabotage and reconnaissance group of the armed forces of Ukraine has entered the territory of the Graivoronsky district. The Russian armed forces, together with the border service, the Russian guard and the FSB, are taking the necessary measures to eliminate the enemy. I will report the details,” he said. Reuters reports that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the private Russian army Wagner, repeated his vow to pull his troops out of Bakhmut in three days, and hand over the defence of the newly captured city to regular troops. “On the western edges, defensive positions have been set up, and so Wagner will be leaving Artyomovsk between 25 May and 1 June,” he said, using the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut. “If the Defence Ministry’s own forces aren’t enough, then we have thousands of generals – we just need to put together a battalion of generals, give them all guns, and it’ll all be fine.” Prigozhin has been a vocal critic of the army and defence establishment support that his Wagner mercenaries have received. Moscow’s defence ministry acknowledged that some Russian troops fell back outside Bakhmut last week, but has denied Prigozhin’s repeated assertion that the flanks were crumbling, or that the military had withheld ammunition from Wagner. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state-owned enterprise for the nation’s nuclear power plants, has released a statement on the restoration of power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP). Ukrainian experts restored the operation of the Dniprovsk 750 kV high-voltage power transmission line, from which the temporarily occupied ZNPP supplies its own needs. The risk of a nuclear and radiation accident is minimised, the situation is stable. We will remind you that on the morning of 22 May, at 5.26am, this line was disconnected as a result of Russian shelling. Since it is the last one that powers the ZNPP, all backup diesel generators are automatically turned on. As a result, the station experienced a blackout for the seventh time since the beginning of the occupation. Earlier one of the Russian-installed leaders of the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region claimed it had been Ukraine who had disconnected the power plant. The claims have not been independently verified. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister says his nation remains open to the idea of giving F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, but no firm position has been arrived at. Rasmussen said: “It doesn’t make sense to train someone to fly a plane if you’ve decided in advance that they can never, ever be allowed to fly the plane. On the other hand, you cannot conclude from this that we have made a decision to donate aircraft.” This follows on from comments earlier this morning where Rasmussen said his nation would like to host a summit in July about finding peace between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence appeared to gave a pictorial response to the proposed peace summit, tweeting a picture of a fighter jet superimposed over a peace symbol, with the caption “Ukraine’s Peace Formula” • This post was amended on 22 May 2023. An earlier version mistakenly identified Rasmussen as the Dutch foreign minister. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the power grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after the US president, Joe Biden, said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Citing Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synyehubov, Suspilne is reporting that two women have been hospitalised after shelling on Kupiansk. It reports “private houses and civil infrastructure were damaged in the city”. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that the external power supply to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) has been restored, after an earlier outage forced the plant to rely on emergency diesel generators. It posted to Telegram: Energy workers have restored the power transmission line that feeds the ZNPP. The station is switching to power from the Ukrainian energy system, Ukrenergo reported. Finland’s state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said on Monday it had terminated a contract to buy natural gas from Gazprom Export via pipelines from Russia. Reuters reports Gazprom ceased pipeline-based natural gas deliveries to Gasum in May 2022 in a dispute over payments, and the two sides had been in talks to resolve the matter. Gazprom demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, which Finland refused to do. Reuters reports Denmark’s foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen has said his nation would like to host a summit in July about how to find peace between Ukraine and Russia, citing the Ritzau news agency. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Novaya Tavolzhanka. Vyacheslav Gladkov posted: In Novaya Tavolzhanka, an explosive device was dropped from a drone next to a private residential building. There were no casualties or damage. The UAV itself fell 100 metres from residential buildings. Explosives and operational services are working on the spot. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city of Bakhmut, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. Reuters reports she said, in televised comments, that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there. In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Russian sources refer to Bakhmut by its Soviet-era name Artemovsk. Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels for the Guardian: The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Meeting in Hiroshima over the weekend, leaders of the west’s seven largest economies, plus the heads of the European Commission and Council, pledged to “starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine”. Significantly, they also promised to reduce reliance on civil nuclear goods from Russia and to restrict the trade in diamonds mined, processed or produced in Russia. Nuclear power and diamonds have increasingly been seen as no-go areas for EU sanctions, because of objections from Hungary and Belgium respectively. Hungary, which has signed a contract with Rosatom to build nuclear reactors, has repeatedly threatened to veto any nuclear sanctions, while Belgium, home to one of the world’s largest diamond trading hubs, has used more subtle diplomacy to get the precious stones off EU sanctions lists. The Belgian government argues that an international agreement to stop Russian stones being traded elsewhere in the world is necessary, rather than unilateral EU action. Borrell did not mention any specific sector in his comments. The promise to implement the G7 text comes as EU27 member states continue to spar over the current sanctions proposals, largely aimed at clamping down on companies and countries that help Moscow dodge western measures. Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billström, said talks were well under way and he was confident of an eventual agreement, despite Hungary’s threats to block the latest proposals. Earlier we reported remarks published on the Russian embassy in Washington’s Telegram channel by ambassador Anatoly Antonov, in which he appeared to draw a separate line between attacks on Crimea and attacks on the four regions of Ukraine which the Russian Federation claimed to annex last year. He said: I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, appears to have retorted to that this morning in a tweet, saying: Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop “Russian aggressions” and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today … The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. In a message on Telegram, Alexander Bogomaz said: The armed forces of Ukraine fired mortars at the village of Khoromnoe in the Klimovsky district. There were no casualties. As a result of the shelling, one household and an outbuilding caught fire. Operational and emergency services are on site. Bryansk region is to the north of Ukraine, and shares its borders with Ukraine and Belarus. The claims have not been independently verified. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. In a tweet, he wrote: Ukraine’s ZNPP this morning lost all external electricity for seventh time during conflict, forcing it to rely on emergency diesel generators for power; nuclear safety situation at the plant extremely vulnerable. We must agree to protect plant now; this situation cannot continue. The Kyiv Post is carrying a video clip which it claims shows damage to one of the fire stations in Dnipro which appears to have been targeted in an overnight attack. Oliver Carroll, foreign correspondent at the Economist, has tweeted one of the images released from the scene, observing “Russia may have targeted emergency services in missile attacks on Dnipro last night. Local authorities reporting massive damage in one of the stations - more than 20 vehicles destroyed.” Other images released by officials in Ukraine show several views of the damage. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure since it began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The former commander of joint forces command Richard Barrons has been on Sky News in the UK, and he was asked what difference sending F-16 planes could make to Ukraine’s war effort. He told viewers: It is a very complex fourth generation aircraft will give Ukraine a decisive advantage over the Russian air force and indeed, over Russian ground forces if they get to the right threshold of capability, and have the family of ammunition that make the aircraft so effective. It would turn the battle in the skies in favour of Ukraine when Ukraine has enough of aircraft, enough competence with it and enough of the family of missiles that make it effective. There’s not much wrong with [the Ukrainian air force], it is certainly full of spirit. But it’s aircraft are mostly Russian aircraft, and therefore well known to the Russians. So they’ve not been able to throw the Russian air force out of the skies, and they’ve relied very heavily on their ground air defences. F-16s will give them the ability to take Ukraine air power over Russian forces in Ukraine. That will be a gamechanger. However, Barrons stressed it was not a short-term project. We should recognise that F-16s will take about 18 months to become combat effective in Ukraine. So what this signals is an expectation on the part of the G7 and others and President Zelenskiy that whatever the outcome of the offensive they’re about to mount, this war will go on into next year. Here is an update on the situation overnight in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Ukraine says at least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one man was wounded in the attack on Dnipro city and seven people were injured on an attack on Synelnykivskyi district of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Reuters reports the governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A picture is worth a thousand words and the images from the G7 summit in Hiroshima this weekend were a good example of that. Volodymyr Zelenskiy was pictured at the centre of a “family portrait” with G7 leaders at the weekend, symbolising their support for the Ukrainian president. Just less than 10 years ago the G7 was the G8 – when Russia was a member of the group and president Vladimir Putin attended summits. Moscow was kicked out in 2014 after the invasion of Crimea. Other pictures showed Zelenskiy being hugged by French president Emmanuel Macron, US president Joe Biden with his arm around him, and sharing smiles and handshakes with other leaders including Canada’s Justin Trudeau and the UK’s Rishi Sunak. More on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with Ukraine’s state-owned power generating company Energoatom confirming that it has experienced a power outage. “Yes, we have the seventh blackout since the start of the [Russian] occupation,” Energoatom told Reuters. Yuriy Malashko, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, said there was a fire at one of the facilities in Zaporizhzhia city due to an overload in the power system. “Problems with electricity supply that arose in the city of Zaporizhzhia are not related to shelling,” Malashko said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: So far Washington is opposing us … by proxy. However, every specialist knows that there is no infrastructure for the use of F-16s in Ukraine, and the required number of pilots and maintenance personnel is not there either. What would happen if American fighters take off from Nato airfields, operated by foreign ‘volunteers’? I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of “blessing” the Kiev regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response. Volodymyr Zelenskiy stole the show at the G7 summit, Patrick Wintour writes in his analysis of the weekend, with Zelenskiy’s whirlwind round of diplomacy the culmination of a Ukrainian realisation that for months they have been talking to wrong people. Yes, it is essential to keep lines constantly open to Ukraine’s invested allies in the west, reaping the rewards such as Joe Biden’s decision finally to lift his veto on Ukrainian pilots training to fly US-made F-16 fighter aircraft, but the identification of the west with Ukraine’s cause is almost complete. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, ended her remarks by saying “Slava Ukrajni – Glory to Europe”. But Ukraine for months has known it is not telling its story clearly enough to the phalanx of 40 or so nonaligned states that have abstained at successive UN general assembly votes on the war. India, Brazil, China and as many as 20 African states have sat on the sidelines in the key votes. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been switched to standby and emergency power supply generators, a Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region says.. Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. “(The power) partially disappeared in Zaporizhzhia due to an emergency situation at one of the energy facilities,” Kurtev said on the Telegram messaging app. Explosions were heard in the city of Dnipro overnight as well as in Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv, with a nationwide air raid alert activated at 3.48am, according to the Kyiv Independent. The city of Odesa was also reportedly hit by Russian combat drones late on Sunday. In a Telegram post, the governor of Dnipro, Serhiy Lysak, said: “Thanks to the defence forces, we withstood the attack.” He later said 15 drones and four cruise missiles had been shot down over the region, while eight people had been injured, including three taken to hospital. Dozens of vehicles were destroyed or damaged as well as nine apartment buildings, several private homes, shops, a kindergarten and administrative buildings, he said. Ukraine’s armed forces have sent a series of photos from Bakhmut, which show some of the extent of the city’s destruction. At the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, “I’ll tell you openly: photographs of ruined Hiroshima absolutely remind me of Bakhmut and other similar settlements. Nothing left alive, all the buildings ruined.” Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Confusion has reigned as Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out air strikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Here’s our full report on the back-and-forth by Peter Beaumont and Julian Borger: Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said he is “upset” that he and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. AFP reports: Zelenskiy, who emerged from the summit in Hiroshima with fresh diplomatic support and pledges of more military aid, had sought a one-on-one meeting with Lula, who has faced accusations of being soft on Russia over its invasion. Both leaders said scheduling conflicts had prevented them from meeting – which Zelenskiy quipped had likely left his Brazilian counterpart “disappointed”. “I wasn’t disappointed. I was upset, because I’d like to meet him and discuss the matter,” Lula told a news conference before heading home from Japan. But “Zelenskiy is a grown-up. He knows what he’s doing,” he added. Lula said his team had scheduled a meeting with Zelenskiy for Sunday afternoon. But the Ukrainian leader ran late, and his own agenda was full after that, he said. Lula said he did not see a point in meeting Zelenskiy now, saying neither he nor Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to want peace. “For now, they’re both convinced they’re going to win the war,” he said. Lula is pushing for peace talks and has proposed Brazil as a mediator, along with other “neutral” countries, including China and Indonesia. But the veteran leftist faced criticism last month when he accused the United States of “encouraging” the war. After the White House accused him of “parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda”, Lula toned down his rhetoric, saying Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion. But he renewed his criticism Monday. US president Joe Biden, he said, is sending the message that “Putin has to surrender and pay for everything he wrecked”. “That message isn’t helping,” he said. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Helen Livingstone and I’ll be bringing you the latest. Bakhmut and the nearby Donetsk city of Marinka remain the “epicentre” of the conflict, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, a day after Russia claimed it had completed its “liberation” of the ruined city. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russia had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” Here are other recent developments: Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the G7 summit in Japan as a “politicised” event which it said had pumped out anti-Russian and anti-Chinese statements. In a statement posted on Telegram, the Russian foreign ministry said the G7 had “irreversibly deteriorated” and that the forum had become “an ‘incubator’ where, under the leadership of the Anglo-Saxons, destructive initiatives that undermine global stability are prepared”. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April. The head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev will hold talks on Monday with Chen Wenqing, member of the Chinese Communist party’s politburo who oversees police, legal affairs and intelligence, the Russian RIA state news reported. Patrushev, a former chief of the FSB internal security service, is widely seen as one of the most hawkish members of Putin’s inner circle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T19:00:55Z","webTitle":"Biden and Xi condemn Russian nuclear threats; Zelenskiy visits liberated Kherson – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-race-to-restore-power-and-water-in-kherson-murdered-civilians-found-zelenskiy-says","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a visit to the newly liberated city of Kherson, where he spoke to troops. “We are moving forward,” he told them. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He also thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought”, the White House said. Beijing’s readout from the long-awaited meeting in Bali differed slightly and did not mention the pair agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. Biden said Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine and that he was confident Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. The US president said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. The UN’s general assembly has approved a resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts”, the resolution read. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery” and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. The governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. Rishi Sunak called Russia a “pariah state” on the eve of the G20 summit in Indonesia. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity at the talks to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin’s absence. The US has announced fresh sanctions, targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. The latest sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov’s network. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. They include the actor Jim Carrey and the author Margaret Atwood. The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least €8bn (£7bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. A pro-Russia tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russia militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow. The UN’s general assembly has approved a resolution calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion of Ukraine, including by making reparations to Kyiv. The resolution, supported by 94 of the assembly’s 193 members, recognises that Russia must be held accountable for violations of international law in or against Ukraine. Russia “must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for the injury, including any damage, caused by such acts”, the resolution reads. Ukraine’s state railway service, Ukrzaliznytsia, has begun repairing damaged rail tracks and infrastructure on the Kherson line, according to the country’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov. Family members of a former Russian prison inmate who defected to Ukraine after being recruited by the Kremlin-linked private military group Wagner have expressed “horror” after a gruesome video emerged on Friday that showed him being killed by repeated blows with a sledgehammer. Footage of the killing of Yevgeny Nuzhin was posted over the weekend by the Wagner-linked Telegram channel Grey Zone. In the video, Nuzhin was shown lying down with his head taped to a brick wall as an unidentified man in combat clothing hit him with a sledgehammer. Nuzhin, 55, had been serving a 24-year prison sentence for a murder he committed in 1999, but was freed in July and conscripted into Wagner, a notorious military group run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful Russian businessman and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. Following his capture by Ukrainian forces in September, Nuzhin gave a series of interviews in the country, in which he said he had joined the Wagner group to get out of prison and that he had quickly hatched a plan to surrender to Ukraine. In the interviews, he also criticised the Russian leadership and expressed his desire to join the Ukrainian forces and fight against Moscow. Ilya Nuzhin, Yevgeny’s son, confirmed to the Guardian on Monday that the man in the video was his father but declined to give further comments, citing “security concerns”. Read the full story here: The EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least €8bn (£7bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels, he said this was about 45% of what the US has supplied to Kyiv. Borrell added that the EU would “continue isolating Russia internationally” and continue imposing “restrictive measures” against Russia’s economy. Rishi Sunak has called Russia a “pariah state” on the eve of his first meeting of the G20 in Indonesia, where he has vowed to confront Moscow’s representative in public and on the sidelines of the summit. The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity during the summit to confront Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who is attending in Vladimir Putin’s absence, and said that would be not only in the hall itself but at any opportunity if the two came face-to-face. “Russia is becoming a pariah state and he’s [Putin] not there to take responsibility for what he’s doing,” Sunak told reporters on the plane before the meeting in Bali, where he will meet Lavrov for the first time. But I’m going to use the opportunity to put on the record my condemnation of what they’re doing. I will do that in the hall, I will do that if I see him elsewhere, and that’s the right thing to do. Sunak said his opening words at the G20 would be to condemn Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine and said there was no suggestion the Russians were prepared to restart peace negotiations. Read the full story here: Russia’s foreign ministry has announced it has banned entry to 100 Canadians, including the actor Jim Carrey and author Margaret Atwood, in the latest in a series of tit-for-tat measures. In a statement, it said the Canadians added to its sanctions list included officials, business leaders and people involved with “media and financial structures that are directly involved in the formation of an aggressive anti-Russian course”. The list includes Danielle Smith, the premier of the province of Alberta; journalists at the public broadcaster CBC; and several members of the Canada-Ukraine Foundation. The announcement comes after Canada announced a new round of Russia-related sanctions on police officers, investigators, prosecutors and judges. The Russian ministry said it had decided on the new round of sanctions “in response to the practice, implemented by Justin Trudeau’s regime, of imposing sanctions against the Russian leadership, politicians and parliamentarians, business representatives, experts and journalists, cultural figures”. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, has said he is “hopeful” Russia will extend the Black Sea graininitiative. The UN is “working non-stop” to renew the “essential” deal that gives safe passage to Ukrainian grain shipments, Guterres said during a press conference at the G20 summit in Bali. Talks over the last week had delivered “a lot of progress” on the deal, which is set to expire on Saturday, he added. He said: We need urgent action to prevent famine and hunger in a growing number of places around the world. The Black Sea grain initiative, and efforts to ensure Russian food and fertilisers can flow to global markets, are essential to global food security. The US has announced fresh sanctions targeting a transnational network that has been working to procure technology to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. The sanctions target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including family members of the Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, as well as people that it says worked as financial facilitators in Kerimov’s network. In a statement, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: The United States will continue to disrupt Russia’s military supply chains and impose high costs on President Putin’s enablers, as well as all those who support Russia’s brutality against its neighbour. The US treasury department also blacklisted Milandr, a Russian microelectronics company that it says is part of Moscow’s military research and development structure. It has also imposed sanctions on major military industrial companies in Russia. The US commerce department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia’s military hardware. It’s 6pm in Kyiv and Moscow. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a visit to the newly liberated city of Kherson, where he spoke to troops. “We are moving forward,” he told them. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He also thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders as Zelenskiy addressed the crowd. “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,” said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. “The people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.” The US president, Joe Biden, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought”, in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags before the three-hour meeting on the resort island and “spoke candidly” about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. China’s readout from the meeting differed slightly, with the New York Times reporting: “Unlike the White House’s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war.” In remarks to the media after his meeting with China’s president, Biden said that Kherson was a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it was hard to tell at this point what the victory would mean, but that the US would continue to support Ukraine. He said he was confident that Russia would not occupy Ukraine as it intended. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn peninsula in the southern part of Kherson, after an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. A pro-Russia tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russia militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery” and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth”. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a checkup. The White House confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, was in Ankara in Turkey on Monday to speak with his Russian counterpart. A White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations, and he was conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. The Kremlin has confirmed talks between US and Russian officials took place in Ankara today, Russian state-owned news agency Tass has reported, citing Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Zambia has asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine where he was killed, Zambia’s foreign affairs minister said on Monday, Reuters reports. Stanley Kakubo said in a statement that Russia had notified Zambia about the death in September of the 23-year-old, but did not provide details. The Zambian student was serving a jail sentence at a medium security prison on the outskirts of Moscow after being convicted of contravening Russian law, Kakubo said, without specifying the offence that occurred in April 2020. “The Zambian government has requested the Russian authorities to urgently provide information on the circumstances under which a Zambian citizen, serving a prison sentence in Moscow, could have been recruited to fight in Ukraine,” Kakubo said. It was not clear how the prisoner was recruited and by whom. Reuters could not independently verify the details surrounding his death. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canada will provide Ukraine with a further $500m (£425m) in additional military assistance in addition to sanctions on nearly two dozen more Russians, prime minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on Monday as the G20 summit began. Reuters reports the funding is additional to the $3.4bn Canada has given to Kyiv so far for its defence against Russia’s invasion and will help fund military, surveillance and communications equipment, fuel and medical supplies, the statement said. Monday’s sanctions target 23 Russian individuals “involved in gross and systematic human rights violations against Russian opposition leaders”, including police officers, prosecutors, judges and prison officials, Trudeau’s office said. Chris Buckley at the New York Times is reporting that China’s readout of the meeting between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping differs slightly for the US account. Buckley writes: Unlike the White House’s account, the Chinese account did not mention Xi and Biden agreeing on opposing Russia’s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. According to the Chinese account, Xi said that “China is highly concerned with the current situation in Ukraine”. Xi also said that “a complicated issue does not have a simple solution,” and that “confrontation between major powers must be avoided.” In remarks to the media after his meeting earlier with China’s president, Xi Jinping, the US president, Joe Biden, has said that Kherson is a significant victory for Ukraine. Biden said it is hard to tell at this point what the victory will mean, but that the US will continue to support Ukraine. Reuters reports he said he is confident that Russia will not occupy Ukraine as they intended. The White House has confirmed that the CIA director, William J Burns, is in Ankara in Turkey to speak with his Russian counterpart. Reuters reports that a White House official said Ukraine was briefed in advance about the visit, and that Burns was not conducting any kind of negotiations. A national security council spokesperson told CNN: We have been very open about the fact that we have channels to communicate with Russia on managing risk, especially nuclear risk and risks to strategic stability. As part of this effort, Bill Burns is in Ankara today to meet with his Russian intelligence counterpart. He is not discussing settlement of the war in Ukraine. He is conveying a message on the consequences of the use of nuclear weapons by Russia, and the risks of escalation to strategic stability. He will also raise the cases of unjustly detained US citizens. US president Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war “should never be fought” in a long-awaited meeting in Bali earlier today, the White House said. The pair shook hands in front of the US and Chinese flags ahead of the three-hour meeting on the resort island and “spoke candidly” about a range of issues, including key regional and global challenges, the White House said in a statement. It said: President Biden raised Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and Russia’s irresponsible threats of nuclear use. President Biden and President Xi reiterated their agreement that a nuclear war should never be fought and can never be won and underscored their opposition to the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The two leaders held their first face-to-face talks since Biden took office on the sidelines of the G20 summit. The US and China shared the responsibility to show the world that they can “manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming conflict”, Biden said. Britain’s prime minister Rishi Sunak, who is in Bali for the G20 summit, said he would use the opportunity to “unequivocally condemn” Russia’s war in Ukraine. He told broadcasters: I’m going to use this opportunity to unequivocally condemn Russia’s hostile and illegal war in Ukraine. And I know that other allies will as well because it’s right that we highlight what is going on and hold Russia to account for that and I won’t shy away from doing that you accept. Sunak appeared to acknowledge that the G20 was divided on the issue of explicitly condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine: The G20 is a very different forum to the G7 for example. The G7 is a group of like-minded liberal democracies with similar values. The G20, we have to acknowledge, is a different grouping. But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be engaged in it. We should make our voices heard and constructively work with people where we can to make a difference for people at home as well. And you saw that recently, when it came to migration, the ability to talk to other countries can have benefits for people at home and that’s what I’m here to deliver. A pro-Russian tank gunner who was accused of firing into residential buildings in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason, according to Ukraine’s state security service (SBU). The pro-Russian militant, nicknamed “Phil”, had fired “at least 20 shots at residential high-rise buildings in Mariupol”, the SBU said in a statement. The statement said: The Security Service of Ukraine collected indisputable evidence of crimes committed by the militant of the ‘DPR’ [Donetsk People’s Republic] terrorist organisation nicknamed ‘Phil’. The evidence allowed the court to imprison him for 12 years. The man was captured by Ukrainian forces near the eastern village of Rivnopil in April after his tank came under attack. He was found guilty of high treason and the “creation of unauthorised armed groups or participation in its activities”, the SBU said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew. Addressing Ukrainian soldiers in front of the administration building in the main square, Zelenskiy said: We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country. The president sang the Ukrainian national anthem as the country’s blue and yellow flag was hoisted in the southern city. According to Russian media sources, the Ukrainian army has entered the city of Herois’ke, in the Kinburn Peninsula, following an amphibious operation, as heavy fighting continues across the region. On Sunday, there were “unconfirmed reports’’ that Ukrainian forces were about to launch a “small-scale amphibious operation” on the peninsula, in Biloberezhia Sviatoslava national park, which connects to Russian-occupied territory on the eastern side of the Dnipro River. Ukrainian troops are likely to continue consolidating control of the western bank in the coming days. A draft resolution by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, seen by Reuters, calls on Russia to cease all actions against Ukraine’s nuclear facilities including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The draft of what would be the third resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) 35-nation board of governors reads: (The board) calls upon the Russian Federation to abandon its baseless claims of ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, to immediately withdraw its military and other personnel from the plant, and to cease all actions against, and at, the plant and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine. The wording of the draft is similar to that of the two previous resolutions passed in March and September. Both resolutions were passed with large majorities, with only Russia and China opposing them. We have just arrived in a small, coastal village, named Kobleve, in the region of Mykolaiv, facing the vast Black Sea. Crimea is “only’” 140km away from here. Just yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy suggested that Crimea, illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, is an active Ukrainian military target and that, after the liberation of Kherson, the Ukrainians could try to take it back. “We will definitely reach our state border – all sections of the internationally recognised border of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. The beach and sea are infested with hundreds of mines placed by both sides in Russia’s war on Ukraine, posing a serious threat to people. The Ukrainian government has banned coastal bathing. Experts agree it will take years to de-mine the Black Sea. The Russian president Vladimir Putin’s aim is to “leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter”, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said. Russia’s withdrawal from Kherson demonstrates the “incredible courage” of Ukraine’s armed forces, the military alliance chief said during a press conference with members of the Dutch government in The Hague. It is up to Ukraine to decide what terms are acceptable for negotiations to bring an end to the war, he said, adding Nato’s role was to support Kyiv. Stoltenberg said: We should not make the mistake of underestimating Russia. The Russian armed forces retain significant capabilities, as well as a large number of troops and Russia has demonstrated the willingness to bear significant losses. They have also shown extreme brutality. He added: The coming months will be difficult. Putin’s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course. Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, has shared a video showing the Ukrainian president singing the national anthem as the flag of Ukraine is raised over the city of Kherson. Kirill Stremousov was in the mood for a chat. A political marginal on the fringes of society just six months ago, he was clearly relishing the newfound attention he was receiving as the public face of Russia’s occupation of Ukraine’s Kherson region. “I am on a constant high,” the Moscow-installed official told the Guardian in a phone interview in August. We have won. I am living in a dream. Russia is in Kherson for ever. That “for ever” ended abruptly on Wednesday, when Stremousov, 45, was killed in a car crash as he was speeding away from Kherson. By that time, he was already fully aware that his dream of a Russian Kherson would soon be torn apart as Ukrainian troops were closing in to liberate the city. On Friday evening, in remarkable scenes, crowds of jubilant residents greeted Ukraine’s armed forces as they reached the centre of Kherson. Stremousov’s rise and fall is a story of how one man’s ruthless opportunism and ideological fantasies can play out in a war-torn country. It also serves to demonstrate how thuggish and unsavoury characters thrive in Russia today as the country’s leadership embraces anti-western hysteria. Read the full story here: On Sunday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. He said: Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered. After two nights of jubilation after the liberation of their city, on Sunday Kherson residents began to assess the extent of the damage wreaked by eight long months of Russian occupation, with many homes still without electricity and water. A Turkish official has declined to comment on a report that Russian and US delegations were holding talks in the Turkish capital, Ankara. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that officials from the two countries were meeting today, citing a source. The paper claimed that Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence agency, was reportedly part of the Russian delegation. The Kremlin said it could neither confirm nor deny the story. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you the latest developments on the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Addressing troops in front of the administration building in the main square, the president said: “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” Russian forces destroyed key infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern city of Kherson before retreating, Zelenskiy had said in his nightly address. Russia troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity”, he said. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread. Zelenskiy said authorities had dealt with nearly 2,000 mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Ukrainians hailed Russia’s retreat from Kherson as Kyiv said it was working to de-mine the strategic southern city and restore power across the region. In the formerly occupied villages of Pravdyne and Snihurivka, outside Kherson, returning locals embraced returning troops and their neighbours, some unable to hold back tears. “Victory, finally!” one said. The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. Ukraine can “feel the approach of our victory” he added in his latest national address. Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. “Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. There was confusion after it was reported that Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov had been hospitalised after arriving in Bali for the G20 summit. Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed the claim as “the height of fakery”, and posted a video of Lavrov sitting reading documents at his hotel. In the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth”. However, the governor of Bali said that while Lavrov was in good health, he had been in hospital for a check-up. The EU’s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: “Ukraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.” He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was “very good news” and showed the EU’s strategy of military support was the right one. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back with you later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. Vladimir Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters this morning that the Russian president would not be going to Bali to the G20 summit because “circumstances dictate the priority of the president being in the Russian Federation”, according to a report from the state-owned Tass news agency. The Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, spent 30 minutes on Monday morning visiting the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after Russian troops withdrew from the city over the River Dnipro to the southern portion of the Kherson region. Reuters reports that he addressed troops in front of the administration building in the main square. He said: “We are moving forward. We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia and said the delivery of high-mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) from the US had made a big difference to Ukraine’s war effort. Parents with children, some pushing baby strollers, also gathered in the main square in front of the administration building that until recently was occupied by Russian forces. Some people waved Ukrainian flags and others had the flag draped over their shoulders. “I’m really happy, you can tell by the reaction of the people, their reaction is not staged,” said Zelenskiy, who was flanked by heavily armed security guards. “The people were waiting for the Ukrainian army, for our soldiers, for all of us.” He said it was important to visit Kherson to show support for residents who endured about eight months of Russian occupation and to demonstrate to them that “we are really returning, we really raise our flag”. Asked by reporters where Ukrainian forces might advance next, he said: “Not Moscow … We’re not interested in the territories of another country.” Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that the Russian Federation has claimed to annex, despite not controlling the territory. On his official Telegram channel, Zelenskiy posted a series of images from the trip, accompanied with the simple messages “Kherson – Ukraine 🇺🇦” and “Our heroes 🇺🇦” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted a series of photographs of his visit to Kherson on his Telegram channel with the simple message “Kherson – Ukraine 🇺🇦” in Ukrainian and English. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has tweeted that the EU is increasing the amount of money it is devoting to supporting food security, saying: “Putin’s war is bringing millions to the brink of starvation.” Here is a short video clip of the Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kherson. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has just posted a video to her Telegram account that appears to show Sergei Lavrov working at a table outside his hotel suite in Bali and reacting to the news that he is reported to be in hospital. Reuters reports that in the video, Lavrov says: “This is a kind of game that is not new in politics. Western journalists need to be more truthful – they need to write the truth.” However, the governor of Bali has said that Lavrov was in good health, and had been in hospital for a check-up. While there continues to be some confusion about Sergei Lavrov in Bali, it is definite that Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited Kherson, and we have just received some images from his trip. According to Reuters, it is Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova who has dismissed the claim that Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali. “This, of course, is the height of fakery,” Reuters report her saying. Reuters is reporting that the Russian foreign ministry has dismissed the earlier Associated Press claim that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was hospitalised in Bali as “fake news”. More details soon … Russian media including RIA Novosti and Tass are this morning carrying allegations of mistreatment of Russian prisoners of war by their Ukrainian captors. In particular, they are carrying quotes from the press service of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation in which a Russian soldier alleges he was buried alive as part of an interrogation. According to the RIA report, the committee alleges: One of the released soldiers said that the Ukrainian servicemen tied his hands and feet, put a bag over his head and did not take it off for several days. During this time he was beaten. In addition, due to dissatisfaction with the answers to their questions, the nationalists put a gun to his head and threatened to shoot and bury him. “They fulfilled the last threat by throwing the prisoner to the bottom of the trench and covering it with earth. The threat of deprivation of life was so real that only after lying in this position for about five hours did he realise that he would live,” the department noted. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson, days after a Russian troop withdrawal from the southern Ukrainian city after months of occupation, a Reuters witness said. “We are moving forward,” he told troops. “We are ready for peace, peace for all our country.” He thanked Nato and other allies for their support in the war against Russia. Associated Press have a quick snap to say that according to Indonesian officials, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was taken to hospital after arriving for the G20 summit in Bali. More details soon … Reuters has a quick snap that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited the newly liberated city of Kherson. More details soon … Viacheslav Chaus, the governor of Chernihiv, has posted to Telegram to say that in the last week de-mining efforts in the region had removed 377 explosive objects. The Chernihiv region is to the north of Kyiv, and was one of the areas Russia attacked in February from Belarus in its failed attempt to capture Ukraine’s capital city. Jennifer Rankin reports for the Guardian from Brussels: The EU’s top diplomat has said Ukraine will decide when to enter talks with Russia, amid growing speculation that western capitals will pressure Kyiv into negotiations. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said: “Ukraine will decide what to do. Our duty is to support them.” He was arriving for the monthly meeting of EU foreign ministers, which will be focused on the war in Ukraine. Borrell said the Russian retreat and recapture of Kherson by Ukraine was “very good news” and showed the EU’s strategy of military support was the right one. He claimed that EU military support was greater than some reports suggested, amid growing frustration from EU capitals that the bloc’s efforts are not being recognised vis-a-vis US aid. “I think it’s very important to put the right figures on the table,” Borrell said, promising further details later. EU foreign ministers are set to agree further sanctions against prominent Iranians, in response to the violent crackdown on human rights and will also discuss Teheran’s role in supporting Russia’s war in Ukraine. Borrell said the bloc had no evidence Iran was supplying Russia with missiles, although there is some concern this may be the case. Last month, the EU sanctioned four Iranians involved in supplying lethal drones used by Russia to attack Ukraine. Here are some more images from the newly liberated city of Kherson that have been sent to us over the newswires. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reports that overnight in the areas of the region controlled by Ukraine, two people were injured, and that one house, seven high-rise buildings, a kindergarten and an administrative building were damaged by shelling from pro-Russian forces. Donetsk is one of the regions of occupied Ukraine that Russia has claimed to annex following a “referendum”, despite not fully controlling the territory. In the FT this morning, Henry Foy and Mercedes Ruehl have a bleak assessment of the likelihood of unity over the war in Ukraine at the G20 summit in Bali this week. They write: “This really is the first G20 to take place after the end of the post-cold war era. You know, this is a new world,” said Charles Kupchan, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think-tank. “We’re back in a global landscape in which there is militarised rivalry between the west and Russia. And that rivalry is now extending to China. And as a consequence, the ability of the G20 to function as a co-operative body is very much called into question.” “I would not want to be the Indonesians in the sense that you really are hosting a meeting that is taking place against the backdrop of a level of ideological and geopolitical division that we haven’t seen since the Berlin Wall came down,” said Kupchan, who was special assistant to former US president Barack Obama. “There will be no agreement on language condemning Russia’s war in Ukraine,” said a senior German official of the G20, echoing downbeat assessments from other western delegations. In closed-door meetings to draft the summit communiqué, China has maintained its strong support for Russia, stymying efforts by western officials to include language condemning the war. Hanna Arhirova is in Kherson for Agence France-Presse, and she has spoken to 73-year-old Yevhen Teliezhenko. He and his wife have been driving around the city, flying their Ukrainian flag and asking the soldiers who liberated them to autograph it. “They were fighting for us. We knew we were not alone,” he said. “Finally freedom!” said 61-year-old Tetiana Hitina, Teliezhenko’s wife. “The city was dead.” Karina Zaikina, 24, said that in the final days before they finished their pullout last week, Russian troops grew increasingly nervous and rumours flew around the city “They were stealing and morally pressuring us,” she said. “It was clear that they were scared because they all walked only in groups.” “I woke up calm today,” she added. “For the first time in many months, I wasn’t scared to go to the city.” The UK’s foreign secretary, James Cleverly, interviewed on Sky News, has absolutely ruled out normalising the country’s relationship with Russia during the course of the G20 summit. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. I will be with you for the next few hours. Winter will bring a change in conflict conditions, including fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines and a greater risk of weapon malfunctions, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Changes to daylight hours, temperature and weather will present unique challenges for fighting soldiers. A reduction in daylight hours will result in fewer offensives and more static defensive frontlines, the latest British intelligence report suggests. Night vision capability will also be a precious commodity, further exacerbating the unwillingness to fight at night. As temperatures drop, forces lacking in winter weather clothing and accommodation are highly likely to suffer from non-freezing cold injuries, the ministry adds. Additionally, the “golden hour” window in which to save a critically wounded soldier is reduced by approximately half, making the risk of contact with the enemy much greater. An increase in rainfall, wind speed and snowfall will provide additional challenges to the already low morale of Russian forces and also present problems for kit maintenance. Basic drills such as weapon cleaning must be adjusted to the conditions and the risk of weapon malfunctions increase. New Zealand will send a further 66 defence force personnel to the UK to help train Ukrainian soldiers. New Zealand has a team of 120 defence force (NZDF) personnel training Ukrainians in the UK but this deployment was due to end. The deployment will run from 30 November until July 2023, a government statement said. “I am pleased the NZDF infantry can offer the skills and experience for further training. This deployment also provides an opportunity for NZDF personnel to gain valuable experience,” said Peeni Henare, minister of defence, on Monday. The New Zealand government has also said it would extend the NZDF’s existing intelligence contribution, redeploy four NZDF staff to help with the logistics hub in Europe and provide eight people to support those deployed in the region. No NZDF staff will be sent into Ukraine. The government said it will donate NZ$1.85m ($1.13m) to the World Food Programme to help address global food security and NZ$1.85m to the Nato Trust fund. Images of local residents embracing returning Ukrainian soldiers as they celebrated the liberation of towns and villages throughout Kherson have emerged on our newswires today. Many were reunited for the first time since Russian troops occupied the region in southern Ukraine. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said the US will impose fresh sanctions on a transnational network of individuals and companies that have been working to procure military technologies for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Yellen told reporters on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali the sanctions would target 14 individuals and 28 entities, including financial facilitators, but she declined to provide details on where they were located. She said the announcement was scheduled for later on Monday, according to Reuters. This is part of our larger effort to disrupt Russia’s war effort and deny equipment it needs through sanctions and export controls,” Yellen told reporters. She declined to provide details on which technologies the sanctions would target in an effort to cut off Russian purchases. The US Treasury has sanctioned major military industrial firms in Russia and the Commerce Department has cut off exports of American-made components and US technologies that have been used in some of Russia’s military hardware. A family of four, including an 11-year-old child, has reportedly been killed after the car they were travelling in run over a landmine in the Kherson region. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office, reported the deaths on Sunday evening in a post on his Telegram channel. Tymoshenko said the family hit a landmine in the village of Novoraisk on Sunday, resulting in the fatal explosion. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to return basic services to those living in Kherson after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Russian troops “destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops. Roman Golovnya, an adviser to the city’s local administration, said: “Russian occupying forces and collaborators did everything possible to make those people who remained in the city suffer as much as possible during these days, weeks and months of waiting.” The head of Kherson’s regional state administration said everything was being done to “return normal life” to the area. Speaking from Kherson city in a video poster to social media, Yaroslav Yanushevych said that while de-mining was carried out, a curfew had been put in place and movement in and out of the city had been limited. Retreating Russian forces reportedly destroyed Kherson city’s communications, electricity, water, heat, a 100-metre-tall TV tower and at least four bridges. Ukrainians also accused Russians of blowing up dozens of schools across the province, further damaging the prospects of children who have already missed nine months of lessons. Zelenskiy added that 226 settlements in the Kherson region will be restored, encompassing more than 100,000 local residents. On Sunday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian soldiers of war crimes and killing civilians in Kherson. Investigators have already documented more than 400 Russian war crimes. Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukrainian authorities are scrambling to de-mine the strategic southern city of Kherson and restore power across the region after the retreating Russian army blew up all major infrastructure, leaving residents without electricity and water. Kherson’s mayor said the humanitarian situation was “severe” because of a lack of water, medicine and bread while Zelenskiy said authorities were dealing with thousands of mines, tripwires and unexploded shells left by Russian troops.

Bodies of dead civilians and servicemen have been found. The Russian army left behind the same savagery it did in other regions of the country it entered,” he said on Sunday. Significant new damage to the major Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, which the Russians attempted to blow up during their withdrawal from nearby Kherson, was seen via satellite imagery from US company Maxar. Ukrainian authorities are trying to assess the damage and it is not clear if the structural integrity of the reservoir is at risk. With a water volume of 18.2 cubic km, the reservoir could flood a huge area, including the city of Kherson, if destroyed. Pro-Moscow forces are putting up a fierce fight in the eastern Donetsk region. “Battles in Donetsk region are just as intense as they have been in previous days,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “The level of Russian attacks has not declined. And the level of our resilience and courage is at its highest. We will not allow them through our defence.” The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said some sanctions on Russia could remain in place even after any peace agreement with Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported. Yellen said that any eventual peace agreement would involve a review of the penalties the US and its allies have imposed on Russia’s economy, according to the Journal. “I suppose in the context of some peace agreement, adjustment of sanctions is possible and could be appropriate,” Yellen said in an interview in Indonesia, where she is attending the G20 summit. Russia’s education minister, Sergey Kravstov, has said that military training will return to Russian schools next September, according to the latest update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence. The programme is supported by Russia’s Ministry of Defence, which states that no less than 140 hours per academic year should be devoted to this training. Ukraine will decide on the timing and contents of any negotiation framework with Russia, according to a readout of a meeting between the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, at the Asean summit in Cambodia in Phnom Penh. Vladimir Putin has spoken to his Iranian counterpart, Ebrahim Raisi, by phone and both leaders placed emphasis on deepening political, trade and economic cooperation, the Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday. The discussion of “a number of topical issues on the bilateral agenda” also including the transport and logistics sector, the Kremlin said. It did not say when the phone call took place and made no mention of Iranian arms supplies to Moscow. Russia said there was no agreement yet to extend a deal allowing Ukraine to export grain via the Black Sea, repeating its insistence on unhindered access to world markets for its own food and fertiliser exports, Reuters reported. Ukraine has used the Cop27 climate talks to address how Russia’s invasion is causing an environmental as well as humanitarian catastrophe, with fossil fuels a key catalyst of the country’s destruction."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T05:05:10Z","webTitle":"Nova Kakhovka dam: everything you need to know about Ukraine’s strategically important reservoir ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/nova-kakhovka-dam-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ukraines-strategically-important-reservoir","fields":{"bodyText":"In the early hours on Tuesday, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukraine army’s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a “terrorist act”. Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River lies about 20 miles (30km) east of the city of Kherson. Its destruction will have a number of significant repercussions for the local area – and for Ukraine’s wider war effort. Why is Nova Kakhovka dam significant? The dam traverses Ukraine’s enormous Dnipro River, holding back a huge reservoir of water. The dam itself is 30 metres tall and hundreds of metres wide. It was built in 1956 as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. The reservoir it contains holds an estimated 18 cubic kilometres of water, about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Bursting the dam could send a wall of water flooding settlements below it, including Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Soon after Ukraine accused Russia of blowing up the dam, the head of the Kherson region urged residents to evacuate the area warning that “water will reach a critical level in 5 hours”. Water from the reservoir supplies the Crimean peninsula to the south, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, as well as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, to the north. It also helps power the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Its destruction will add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure. It will also be likely to wreck the canal system that irrigates much of southern Ukraine, including Crimea. Has it been threatened before? Since the start of Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Nova Kakhovka dam has been earmarked as a potential target for both its strategic importance – as well as the damage that its destruction would unleash. It was captured by Russia at the start of Moscow’s February 2022 invasion, and has been held by it ever since. In October, as Ukraine was in the midst of reclaiming large parts of occupied Kherson, Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to warn Russia not to blow up the dam, warning that it would flood a large area of southern Ukraine. At the time, he claimed that Russian forces had planted explosives inside the dam. Zelenskiy said “destroying the dam would mean a large-scale disaster” and compared such an act to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Ukraine military intelligence said “the scale of the ecological disaster [would] go far beyond the borders of Ukraine and affect the entire Black Sea region”. At the same time, Russia accused Kyiv of rocketing the dam and planning to destroy it. After Ukraine recaptured Kherson in November, images emerged of some significant damage to the dam. Russia had accused Ukraine of shelling the dam in its campaign to recapture Kherson. What has been happening this year? In May, residents in a nearby village reported ongoing flooding which they blamed on Russia’s occupation of Nova Kakhovka. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, locals said the water level had begun to rise in April, sometimes by up to 30cm a day, and had remained elevated since. Ukrainian officials said the rise of the Dnipro’s water level, “as a result of which settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were flooded, is linked to the Russian occupation of the Kakhovka dam”. But they added that they were unable to say what exactly Russian forces were doing at the dam because they did not have access themselves. A Russian energy official said in May that the dam risked being overwhelmed by record-high water levels.

He was 49 years old. Frank attained fame in the early 1990s as the green power ranger, Tommy Oliver, who then becomes the white power ranger on a children’s television show about superheroes who are particularly skilled in martial arts. The show generated spin-off movies, action figures and other toys. A cause of death was not immediately released, though multiple reports indicated Frank died by suicide. Word of Frank’s death prompted Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fans to flood social media with tributes. Walter Emanuel Jones, the actor who played the original black power ranger, wrote on Instagram that he was sad to have lost a member of his “special family”. “Can’t believe it,” Jones’s post added. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was about five teenagers deputized to save Earth from evil – it debuted on Fox in 1993 before becoming a pop-culture phenomenon. Early in the first season, Frank’s character was initially a villain, brainwashed by the evil antagonist Rita Repulsa. But soon after, he was inducted in the group of heroes and became one of the most popular characters on the show and its related titles. A practitioner of martial arts, Frank fought in several mixed martial arts bouts in 2009 and 2010. TMZ first reported Frank’s death and said his second wife, Tammie Frank, filed for divorce from him in August. Frank is survived by four children – one from his marriage with Tammie Frank and three from his first marriage to Shawna Frank.

In a 6-3 decision, with the majority opinion by Neil Gorsuch, the justices declared that a Colorado civil rights statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in public businesses violates the first amendment’s freedom of speech. The ruling appears to formalize the right of homophobic business owners to not serve gay people in some situations. 303 Creative v Elenis concerns a woman, Lorie Smith, who operates a website design service and wishes to be exempted from a Colorado civil rights law that requires her to treat all customers equally. Specifically, Smith, a conservative Christian, wants to be able to refuse service to same-sex couples seeking wedding websites, and to be able to place a banner on the home page of her business declaring that she will not make such sites. The court has in recent years dramatically expanded the free exercise of religion clause, often granting conservative Christian plaintiffs leeway to curtail their personal obligations to the law. But 303 Creative offers a different theory of the case: that the legal requirement not to discriminate against gay people is a violation of the plaintiff’s free speech. It’s an odd, and expansive, vision of “speech”. There’s nothing stopping the web designer from, say, buying a billboard to advertise her opposition to gay rights, or from speaking out against such rights in her own writing, electioneering, internet posts and personal life. But Smith didn’t just want to be able to avail herself of all the vast opportunities for speech, expression, debate and persuasion available to her. She wanted to express her bigotry in her business, via the conduct of her public-facing commercial enterprise. She wanted to be able to discriminate at work. The supreme court has now allowed her to. The justices’ decision pertains to the allegedly narrow question of “whether applying a public-accommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the free speech clause of the first amendment”. But there is no real limiting principle in the 303 decision, no matter what the court says; no guarantee that the precedent this decision sets will confine itself to legalizing only discrimination against gay people, or only refusal of service for weddings. Indeed, the case threatens to unravel a whole matrix of anti-discrimination laws governing public accommodations, redefining public-facing commercial enterprises as speech and discrimination as personal expression. The label that Smith wants to put at the top of her business website – effectively declaring that only straight people can be served – evokes the darkest history of public discrimination in this country. The decision’s coming impact on America’s public sphere – where, now, businesses will claim an entitlement to discriminate against vast swaths of the public whom they don’t like – will unfold over the course of years, and it will be profound. If 303 Creative sounds familiar, that’s because it’s an almost beat-by-beat rerun of a similar challenge to the same Colorado law, the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, where the court did not rule on the merits. In Masterpiece, a baker was asked to make a cake for two gay men’s wedding, and sued for the right to refuse them service. Masterpiece garnered a lot of media attention, and much of it focused on the gay couple themselves – two men, in love and looking to celebrate a joyous milestone in their lives, who were subjected to bigotry and indignity, because of a baker who declared he had a right to make hatred a plank of his business. The men looked innocent, victimized, sympathetic. The court looked mendacious, opportunistic and cruel. They blinked. The supreme court likes to pretend that it is not influenced by politics, but the court is in fact a profoundly political institution, tasked with calculating, just as any congressman does, how best to pursue unpopular Republican policy agendas with the least amount of popular pushback. The sympathetic gay couple in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case threatened to provoke pushback. That, as much as any putative legal concern, is why the court then punted. They did not punt in 303 Creative, in part because there is no couple. In fact Smith, the web designer, was never asked to make a website for a gay wedding. At the time she filed her lawsuit, she didn’t even have an actual web design business. (She has one now, and the quality of the work does not make me suspect that gay couples are lining up to have her make websites on their behalf.) It’s not clear that the designer even has standing to sue – she never experienced the event that she says would so injure her. But this means the case has a political virtue for the conservative justices: because there is no real injury in Smith’s case, there is also no gay couple who she has harmed, no one to give face to the impact of her now legally sanctioned bigotry. The decision will create such victims, but the court itself does not have to answer for them in its opinion. 303 Creative, then, is not so much a lawsuit over an actual conflict as it is a fiction of the conservative legal movement. The anti-gay legal machine arguing the case, Alliance Defending Freedom, found a plaintiff and concocted a complaint out of thin air specifically to avoid the pitfalls they encountered in Masterpiece. Interestingly, the New Republic reported earlier this week that a gay man who allegedly contacted Smith asking for her services may not even exist – or rather, that there is a man by the same name, but that he is straight, has been married to a woman for many years, and was wholly unaware that his name was being used in the case. Oral arguments in December were conducted with roughly the same degree of bad faith, with Samuel Alito hijacking the proceedings at one point to pose hypotheticals involving children in Klan robes, a pointed and suggestive remark about dating websites addressed to Elena Kagan, and a convoluted scenario about a Black man playing Santa Claus at a mall. That was about the level of argument advanced by the conservative lawyers, too, who attacked civil rights law via a profoundly cynical rationale: that to eliminate the obligation to serve all comers equally, and to legally sanction bigotry as an operating feature of a public business, would be to advance the cause of pluralism. The argument in 303 Creative has the reasoning of an internet troll: that protecting the right to discriminate against gays in fact preserves diversity; that is, the kind of diversity that’s present when homophobes can discriminate and deny service in their businesses without sanction from the state. The diversity that is encouraged when all people, regardless of identity, can participate as equals in the public square is evidently not as meaningful. Conservative opposition to civil rights law has long argued that not discriminating hurts the dignity of bigots. But the majority opinion seems uninterested in the dignity of gay couples, who now must be subjected to rejection and patronizing lectures about religious freedom when they are only seeking to buy flowers or wedding invitations. Their dignity, their ability to move through the public square with safety and respect, does not matter as much to the court. And this is the baseline assumption of so much of this court’s jurisprudence: that there are some people whose dignity and freedom matters, and must be cognizable to the law – and some whose dignity and freedom do not matter, and can be ignored.

You can read our full story by my colleagues Richard Luscombe and Maya Yang here: Along South Carolina’s coast, North Myrtle Beach, Garden City, and Edisto Island have each seen ocean water flowing over sand dunes and spilling onto beachfront streets Wednesday evening, the Associated Press reports. Preliminary data showed the Wednesday evening high tide reached just over 9.2 feet (2.8 meters), more than 3 feet (0.9 meters) above normal and the fifth-highest reading in Charleston Harbor since records were first kept in 1899. More from that Reuters insurance story: Citizens Property Insurance Corp, Florida’s non-profit, state-backed insurance provider that is seen as an “insurer of last resort”, has been gaining market share since 2022 as primary insurers reduce their exposure to the Florida market, UBS said in its note. Citizens said on Wednesday it is well-capitalized to fund claims from policy holders whose properties are damaged by storms. “There’s no issue with us paying claims to policy holders,” said Michael Peltier, a spokesperson for Citizens Property Insurance. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Ajit Jain said in May that he was happy with the reinsurance the conglomerate had written, but that Berkshire had an “unbalanced portfolio” and a big Florida hurricane would cause a “very substantial loss,” according to a CNBC transcript of the event. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. Florida has a large number of very small, thinly capitalised insurers, insurance experts told Reuters. Some insurance firms including Farmers Insurance, Bankers Insurance and Lexington Insurance, a unit of AIG, have already pulled out of Florida because of the risk of heavy losses, according to a July USA Today report. A spokesperson for Farmers on Wednesday said that it had notified the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its decision to discontinue offering Farmers-branded auto, home, and umbrella policies in the state. “This business decision was necessary to effectively manage risk exposure,” the spokesperson said. “Farmers offers insurance through several different brands, and this decision applies only to policies issued through our exclusive agency distribution channel.” Lexington/AIG declined to comment, while Bankers Insurance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters has spoken to Perry resident Thomas Demps, a Taylor County commissioner: Demps, 80, let out a long, stunned whistle and several exclamations of “Oh, my!” as he walked around Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Perry on Wednesday afternoon. The church took a beating, Perry said, with missing shingles, portions of outside walls torn away and water standing on the floor. “This is the worst storm I’ve ever seen here, never seen it this bad,” said Demps, a retired industrial mechanic. Here are some photos of the damage in Perry, Florida, a small, historic city about 15 miles inland from the coast where Hurricane Idalia made landfall: More now on what Idalia means for Americ'a’s insurance companies, via Reuters: “Historically, what happens when you have these hurricanes is that everyone gets worried about the liability following the hurricane,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York, adding that insurers typically end up being able to raise prices after such events. The impact could have a knock-on effect on reinsurers, which insure insurance companies, and have been raising rates in recent years because of steepening losses that industry players partly attribute to the impact of climate change. Higher reinsurance rates can affect the premiums that insurers charge their customers. Nationally, US reinsurance rates for policies that had claims for natural catastrophes rose 30%-50% during July renewals, while in Florida the increase was 30%-40%, reinsurance broker Gallagher Re said in July. Insurers were expected to face claims for billions of dollars from Hurricane Idalia, adding to a challenging year for the industry that could result in higher premiums for customers, Reuters reports. In Florida, UBS bank estimated average insured losses of $9.36bn with a 50% chance of losses of over $4.05bn and a 10% likelihood of losses of $25.6bn, based on data from 28 August. The wide range reflects potential changes in the storm’s intensity and path. At about $10bn, Idalia would cost insurers less than 10 of the costliest hurricanes to hit the United States. The Associated Press has spoken to a resident in Perry, a mill town located just inland from the Big Bend region where Idalia came ashore. “All hell broke loose,” Belond Thomas said. Thomas, a 41-year-old worker at the town’s paper mill, fled with her family and some friends to a motel, thinking it would be safer than riding out the storm at home. But as Idalia‘s eye passed over about 8.30am, a loud whistling noise pierced the air and the high winds ripped the building’s roof off, sending debris down on her pregnant daughter, who was lying in bed. Fortunately, she was not injured. “It was frightening,” Thomas said. “Things were just going so fast ... Everything was spinning.” Emergency services in Chatham county have warned residents to expect the most severe impacts from the tropical storm between now and 9pm. It is currently just past 8pm local time. “The greatest impact to Chatham county could be rainfall, with predictions of one inch, coastal flooding, and rip currents. Areas prone to flooding are at risk of flooding with the arrival of Idalia. Tides at Fort Pulaski are predicted to be 10.1ft. A risk of severe weather, including tornadoes spawned by Idalia still exists. Potential of strong tropical storm winds with higher gusts,” Emergency Management Chatham county writes on its website. It urges residents to ensure they are monitoring their phone and email for updates. Hello, this is Helen Sullivan with the latest developments as Idalia hits the south-eastern United States. Here are some more images of the flooding and damage from Idalia so far. Officials warn that the storm surge will continue overnight, with flooding expected in the Carolinas. The National Weather Service has warned: “Areas of flash, urban, and moderate river flooding, with considerable impacts, are expected from east central Georgia, through eastern South Carolina and eastern North Carolina into Thursday.” Florida officials said in a new update that the initial search and rescue operations were 75% complete and authorities so far had not confirmed any deaths. “We are not finding anybody at home, so … many, many people heeded the warnings to evacuate,” Kevin Guthrie, director of Florida’s division of emergency management, said at a news briefing, CNN reported. He said the state had not tracked any reports of missing people from local police agencies. Authorities earlier reported two traffic deaths, however, that may have been related to Idalia, including one man who lost control of his car and struck a tree. It’s early evening on the US east coast and here’s a summary of where things stand so far: Hurricane Idalia made landfall shortly after daybreak with 160mph gusts near Keaton Beach on Florida’s Gulf coast. As Idalia tore through Florida, the hurricane split trees in half, flooded roadways and ripped roofs off of buildings. The hurricane also submerged the small coastal community of Steinhatchee and set record-high water levels across a wide area stretching 200 miles south of Tampa. Idalia weakened to a tropical storm on Wednesday afternoon after tearing through the Big Bend region of Florida. Officials say two people have died in car crashes – a 40-year-old motorist in Pasco county, north of Tampa, who collided with a tree after losing control of his car, and a 59-year-old in Gainesville. More than 217,000 customers remained without power in Florida as of early Wednesday evening, according to poweroutage.us. There have been more than a dozen tornado warnings and mandatory evacuation orders in at least 28 Florida counties. A tree split and hit the governor’s mansion, but Ron DeSantis’s wife said no one was injured. DeSantis said, “You loot, we shoot.” Idalia has weakened to a tropical storm after tearing through the Big Bend region of Florida, officials said late on Wednesday afternoon, AP reports. It was a category 3 hurricane when it made landfall near Keaton Beach in Florida early in the morning, but by the afternoon had weakened with winds of 70 mph (113km/h). The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has called Idalia “an unprecedented event”. The National Hurricane Center has issued a warning on power shortages following a storm, urging residents to never use generators indoors or in garages to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. It also urged residents to use flashlights, not candles, to avoid risk of fire. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, warned potential looters seeking to steal from people’s homes following the storm, saying: “You loot, we shoot.” “I’ve told all of our personnel at the state level, you protect people’s property and we are not going to tolerate any looting in the aftermath of a natural disaster. I mean, it’s just ridiculous that you would try to do something like that on the heels of an almost category 4 hurricane hitting this community,” DeSantis said in a press conference on Wednesday. “Also, just remind potential looters that even you never know what you’re walking into. People have a right to defend the property. [In] this part of Florida, you got a lot of advocates [who] are proponents of the second amendment and I’ve seen signs in different people’s yards in the past after these disasters and I would say probably here: ‘You loot, we shoot.’” World Central Kitchen, a non-profit founded by the celebrity chef and restaurateur José Andrés, mobilized its teams across western Florida ahead of Hurricane Idalia making landfall earlier today. WCK teams have prepared hundreds of sandwiches to provide immediate relief for residents. The Florida division of emergency management has issued a warning on hidden dangers of floodwaters. “Please do NOT walk, wade or drive through floodwaters as they can hide a variety of dangers,” the division said. Here are some graphics created by the Guardian’s visuals team on Hurricane Idalia’s path and direction: The Guardian has published an explainer on storm surges and the threat from storm surges from Hurricane Idalia. For the full story, click here: Here are some images of Hurricane Idalia coming through the newswires: The South Carolina governor, Henry McMaster, said that he does not think Hurricane Idalia will be as detrimental as other hurricanes that have swept through the state. “This is not as bad as some that we’ve seen. We don’t think it’s going to be as disruptive as some but it is going to be disruptive. There’s going to be high winds, a lot of water,” McMaster said at a press briefing on Wednesday. He added that the state is not going to have any evacuations, saying: “We are not going to have any evacuations. We’re not have any closing of state agencies ... This does not appear to be one that requires any evacuation orders or closing of state agencies but some of the schools are closed. Some of the schools are closed, we’re urging them to try to get back open back up as quickly as possible … We’ve been through this before. We’ve been through a lot worse than this one appears to be, so we are ready.” Georgia governor Brian Kemp has issued a state of emergency for the state that is set to last until 11.59pm on 8 September. “We are taking every precaution ahead of Hurricane Idalia’s landfall tomorrow, and I am taking this additional executive action to ensure state assets are ready to respond,” Kemp said on Tuesday ahead of Idalia. “Georgians in the expected impact area can and should take necessary steps to ensure their safety and that of their families. We are well positioned to respond to whatever Idalia may bring,” he added. The executive order said that Idalia “has the potential to produce severe impacts to citizens throughout south-central and southeast coastal Georgia”, and that potential flooding, downed trees, power lines, and debris may render “Georgia’s network of roads impassable in affected counties, isolating residences and persons from access to essential public services.” The Guardian’s Ankita Rao has tweeted photos of what she describes as “some of the worst flooding” in Tarpon, Florida, that her parents and friends have seen as a result of Hurricane Idalia. According to Rao, the access to and from one of her friend’s home has been flooded entirely. Other residents can be seen kayaking across the flood waters. Idalia has brought heavy flooding and damage to the state’s Gulf coast after it made landfall slightly before 8am ET on Wednesday as a category 3 storm. “I found them all to be laser focused on what their needs were and I asked them, but I think they’re reassured that we’re going to be there for whatever they need, including search and rescue off the shore,” Biden said of the governors of North and South Carolina, as well as Georgia, as he reffirmed federal assistance to southeastern states currently enduring Hurricane Idalia. “How can we not respond? My god, how can we not respond to those needs?” Biden said in response to whether he can assure Amricans that the federal government is going to have the emergency funding that they need to get through this hurricane season. “I’m confident even though there’s a lot of talk from some of our friends up in the Hill about the cost. We got to do it. This is the United States of America,” he added. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of a climate crisis anymore. Just look around. Historic floods. I mean, historic floods. More intense droughts, extreme heat, significant wildfires have caused significant damage,” Biden said. He added that he has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to redeploy resources, including up to 1,500 personnel and 900 Coast Guard personnel throughout the south-eastern states. Biden said that he approved an early request of an emergency declaration by Florida governor Ron DeSantis “in advance” of Hurricane Idalia’s arrival. He added that he spoke with the governors of Georgia and South Carolia and let each of them know that “if there’s anything the states need right now, I’m ready to mobilize that support.” President Joe Biden is speaking now about Hurricane Idalia. We will bring you the latest updates. Anthony White is in Perry, Florida where the small city is seeing widespread destruction as a result of Hurricane Idalia. He reports for the Guardian: Driving into Perry, a small, historic city with a population of just more than 7,000 on Wednesday morning, about 15 miles inland from the coast where Hurricane Idalia made landfall, the scene of destruction was jaw-dropping. Many residents had evacuated, especially after it was announced that some emergency shelters in the region would need to close because even they may not be able to withstand the impact of the storm. Approaching from Tallahassee, the state capital, 50 miles inland, where I left on Tuesday evening at the urging of relatives – having originally planned to ride out the hurricane – more and more streets and highways were blocked by fallen trees on the approach to Perry. There were power lines down all over the place and poles leaning, flood waters in some parts, and trees blocking even several lanes on both sides of the four-lane highway, forcing people to drive in the median. There was danger everywhere. For the full story, click here: Idalia’s core is moving across southeastern Georgia, with flash and river flooding likely across Georgia and the eastern Carolinas through Thursday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said. President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks on the response from the federal government to Hurricane Idalia. We will be following his remarks live on the blog. Our video team has put together this report on the hurricane’s passage through Florida: Asked to what extent she attributed the cause of Hurricane Idalia to the crimate crisis, Criswell said she was not going to attribute the cause of the storm. She added: What I can say is that we are seeing an increase in the number of severe weather events. What we saw with this storm, as we have seen with several of our hurricanes over the last few years, is that they are intensifying more rapidly due to the elevated heat of the water temperature in the Gulf or in the Pacific or whether it’s in the Atlantic. These storms are intensifying so fast that our local emergency management officials have less time to warn and evacuate and get people to safety. Criswell said her biggest concern is those people who chose not to evacuate. Our priority through the day today is to make sure that everybody is safe. Criswell said more power outages are expected to rise as the storm passes through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina. She urged people who are in the storm’s path should not venture out into the storm, and to heed local officials’ instructions to remain sheltering in place. Do not wait in the water. Do not drive through flooded roads and streets. Just remember – turn around. Don’t drown. Criswell reminded people that “this is very much an active situation” and that remnants of the storm are continuing to affect Florida. The storm is over Georgia and moving into South Carolina. People there and in the Carolinas will continue to experience impacts throughout the day today and possibly into the weekend. Deanne Criswell, chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), is speaking at a White House briefing to discuss response efforts for Hurricane Idalia. President Joe Biden was briefed on Wednesday morning on the storm’s path, the White House said. He is expected to deliver remarks later this afternoon. Biden spoke with Florida governor Ron DeSantis “to let him know that the federal family continues to be there to support him”, Criswell said. She said she would be traveling into the area impacted by the storm this afternoon, and will join DeSantis on Wednesday to see firsthand the damages and assess the necessary recover process. Criswell said it was too soon to assess the total damages of Idalia, but described the hurricane as “the strongest storm to to make landfall in this part of Florida in over 100 years”. Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida governor Ron DeSantis, said a 100-year-old oak tree split open and toppled onto the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee. She said she and their children were home at the time but that no one was injured. Tampa International Airport said it will reopen for arriving flights around 4pm Eastern time. The airport sustained “minimal damage” from Hurricane Idalia, airport officials said. It added: Departing flights and normal operations will resume early Thursday morning. Hurricane Idalia is over southern Georgia, and is now a category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds near 80 mph, the latest update from the National Hurricane Center states. As of 12.21pm Eastern time, nearly 273,000 homes in Florida are without power. According to poweroutage.us, more than 92,000 customers are without power in the state of Georgia. The worst affected area of the storm appears to be Perry County, according to Kevin Guthrie of the Florida division of emergency management. A couple of businesses there have caught on fire and roofs have been damaged, and crews are working on rescues, he said. Madison County has also been affected, with “a lot of debris on the ground”, he said. Florida governor Ron DeSantis said there have been no fatalities that have been confirmed by the Florida department of law enforcement as of this afternoon. He said: We do not have any confirmed fatalities yet. The Florida Highway Patrol had earlier reported two fatal crashes as a result of the storm. Authorities are still assessing the situation on the ground in places that had the initial impact of the storm, he said. Florida governor Ron DeSantis, speaking at a news conference in Tallahassee, said more than 250,000 customers are currently without power in the state. The counties with the highest percentages of power outages are the ones that were in the main pathway of the storm, he said, including: Dixie Levy Taylor Suwannee Madison Jefferson Columbia He warned that the number of people experiencing power outages could go up, but he said utility workers are actively working to restore power. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is providing an update to Hurricane Idalia at a news conference in Tallahassee, where he said the eye of the storm has left the state. Florida is still being affected by the storm, particularly in the northern part of the state, he said. Storm surge has caused extreme flooding in Steinhatchee in Florida’s Big Bend region after Idalia made landfall this morning. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee reported significant spikes in water levels along the Steinhatchee river after Idalia’s landfall in Keaton Beach. The center of Idalia is crossing into southern Georgia as a category 1 hurricane with maximum wind speeds near 85 mph with higher gusts, according to the latest update from the National Hurricane Center. A flash flood emergency has been issued for Valdosta, Georgia, where more than six inches of rain fell this morning. The storm will continue to lash Georgia until the evening, when its center will cross into South Carolina. Two deaths have been attributed to Hurricane Idalia, according to the Florida highway patrol. In one incident in Pasco County, a 40-year-old male driver died after losing control of a Ford Ranger and colliding with a tree. In Alachua County, a 59-year-old male driving a Toyota Tacoma crashed into trees in “extremely rainy conditions” and was killed, the highway patrol said in a statement. Water levels on the Steinhatchee River in Florida’s Big Bend region rose seven feet in the space of just an hour as Idalia made landfall this morning, according to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee. A rare blue supermoon could raise tides above normal just as Hurricane Idalia smashes its way across Florida’s west coast, exacerbating flooding from the storm. The moon will be closest to the Earth on Wednesday, the day Idalia made landfall in Florida. While a supermoon can make for a spectacular backdrop in photos of landmarks around the world, its intensified gravitational pull also makes tides higher. “I would say the timing is pretty bad for this one,” said Brian Haines, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service office in Charleston, South Carolina. It is expected to make tidal flooding worse not only in Florida, but in states such as Georgia and South Carolina, where Haines’s office has been warning residents that parts of Charleston could be under water by Wednesday night. When the moon is full, the sun and the moon are pulling in the same direction, which has the effect of increasing tides above normal ranges, said Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The moon’s gravitational pulls are even stronger when it is closer to Earth, so the tides are even higher. The storm surge is often the greatest killer when hurricanes strike. “There’s a saying that you hide from the wind and run from the water, and hopefully people are heeding that advice,” said Brian Tang, associate professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany in New York. The part of north-west Florida that has been hit by Idalia is especially vulnerable to storm surge because of the region’s geography. The continental shelf extends so far out from the coast and has a gradual slope, allowing the ocean to grow higher as hurricane winds drive the water on to land, Tang said. The shape of the coast in that region – known as Florida’s Big Bend area, where the northern part of the state’s peninsula meets the panhandle – is also curved inward, which can focus the storm surge to make it even more dangerous, he said. The center of Idalia is crossing into Georgia as a category 1 hurricane with maximum wind speeds of 90mph and higher gusts. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said: Although Idalia will weaken further while the center is inland, it is still expected to be a hurricane through this afternoon or evening while moving across southeastern Georgia and southern South Carolina. A tornado watch has been issued for parts of North Carolina and South Carolina and will be in effect until 10pm, the National Weather Service said. Hurricane Idalia has maximum sustained winds of 90mph, making it a category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center’s latest update. A 40-year-old man died in a weather-related accident in Pasco County, part of Florida’s Big Bend region, early this morning, the Florida Highway Patrol said. The driver, who has not been identified, lost control and collided with a tree, suffering fatal injuries, at around 6.15am as the storm was nearing landfall, according to a statement. Idalia remained an extremely dangerous category 2 hurricane as it moved into Georgia after making landfall this morning on Florida’s west coast. Idalia had grown into a category 2 system on Tuesday afternoon and became a category 3 just hours earlier Wednesday, before strengthening to a category 4 and then weakening slightly to a high-end Category 3. A category 3 storm is the first on the scale considered a major hurricane and the National Hurricane Center says a category 4 storm brings “catastrophic damage.” In its latest update posted at 10am Eastern time, the National Hurricane Center said Idalia is still at a category 2 hurricane, with damaging winds spreading into southern Georgia. Wind speeds are near 105 mph with higher gusts. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires from Florida’s Gulf coast, where Hurricane Idalia caused life threatening winds, torrential rains and surging seawater. Mandatory evacuation orders were issued in at least 28 of Florida’s 67 counties as of Tuesday night. Most of the state’s 21 million residents, and many in the adjacent states of Georgia and South Carolina, were under hurricane warnings and other storm-related advisories. State emergency declarations were issued in all three. “They’re expecting some fatalities, so I don’t want to be one of them,” said Rene Hoffman, 62, of Steinhatchee. She owns a food stand that she lashed to her husband’s pickup truck to keep it from washing or blowing away. “This is scary, you know, to think that water could come this high,” she said as she gathered her prescription medications and prepared to leave her home. “We’ve never had water up here before.“ Hurricane Idalia’s 125mph winds, torrential rains and surging seawater were battering Florida’s Gulf coast early on Wednesday in an “unprecedented event” in the state’s Big Bend area as the category 3 cyclone made landfall. Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, warned of a catastrophic impact from the storm as he urged residents who had not heeded evacuation orders to shelter in place. Quickly deteriorating conditions, he told a pre-dawn press conference, would make it too dangerous for emergency crews to respond. “Don’t put your life at risk by doing anything dumb at this point,” he said. This thing’s powerful. If you’re inside, hunker down until it gets past you. You don’t want to be messing around with these winds. There’s going to be things flying all over the place. Idalia, which powered up into a category 4 storm with sustained winds of 130mph and gusts up to 160mph before weakening slightly as it approached the coast, made landfall shortly before 8am ET. It is the most powerful storm ever to hit the state’s Big Bend region, the section of the west side of Florida where the northern part of the peninsula meets the panhandle region, an area of dominated more by nature reserves and rural communities than cities. An hour later it had dropped to a category 2 hurricane. No major hurricane, classed as a category 3 storm with 111mph winds or higher, had previously hit Florida’s Big Bend, a marshy coast, threaded with freshwater springs and rivers, and a cluster of small offshore islands forming Cedar Key, a historic fishing village devastated in 1896 by a hurricane’s storm surge. It is also the third hurricane to make a direct hit on Florida in 12 months after Ian last September and Nicole in November. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee called it “an unprecedented event”, and DeSantis and emergency management officials warned of a storm surge, heightened by a 4am high tide, of up to 16ft in the hurricane’s direct path. More than 245,000 customers in Florida were without power as of around 9am, according to poweroutage.us. Life threatening storm surge will continue through the afternoon across the Big Bend in Florida, the National Weather Service’s office in Tallahassee has warned. People in impacted areas have been urged to shelter in place and stay indoors, keep away from windows, and monitor all the warnings and heed advice from local officials. The National Hurricane Center has warned of “catastrophic” storm surge occurring along the coast of Florida’s Big Bend, as well as “damaging” winds spreading inland over northern Florida, in its latest update. Maximum sustained winds are near 110 mph (175 km/h) with higher gusts, forecasters said. While we’re on the subject of Cedar Key, here’s a clip of the storm surge causing structural damage to a condo complex on the island city off the northwest coast of Florida. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said water levels were continuing to rise as Hurricane Idalia made landfall. Cedar Key on Florida’s Gulf coast is experiencing six feet above normal high tide and rising, the NOAA said. Here’s a clip from Steinhatchee, in Florida’s Big Bend region: Studies have shown there is evidence that Atlantic hurricanes are becoming stronger and intensifying more rapidly due to these accelerants provided by the climate crisis. The current naturally occurring El Niño climate phenomenon, which has heated up the equatorial Pacific Ocean, is normally associated with a weaker hurricane season in the Atlantic, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) recently warned of an above-average period of storms due, in part, to the extreme heat that has accumulated in the oceans. The oceans have absorbed about 90% of the extra heat due to the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, with the heightened temperatures causing stress to fish and bleaching and even death to coral reefs. In July, the waters off southern Florida were measured to be at 101F (38F), a record temperature more often found in Jacuzzis than the ocean that raised fears for the state’s ailing coral reef. A “heat dome” – an area of rigid high pressure that locks in repeatedly high temperatures – has squatted over parts of the US south this summer and brought extreme heat to coastal areas as well as the oceans. Over the weekend, both Houston and New Orleans recorded their hottest temperatures ever measured, reaching 109F (42C) and 105F (40.5C), respectively. Hurricane Idalia, which has triggered evacuations as it threatens to pummel the northern reaches of Florida, is being fueled by unusually high temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, part of a trend of extreme marine heat that has dominated the summer. The rapid intensification of the hurricane – the first to hit the US this year – has been spurred by ocean temperatures that have remained persistently elevated throughout the summer. The eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico have been around 87F (30.5C) to 89F (31C) in recent days, several degrees above the long-term average and part of a vast network of marine heatwaves that have covered nearly half of the world’s oceans this summer. Scientists have said the extreme oceanic heat is consistent with the expected impacts of the climate crisis. The exceptional warmth of the Gulf extends down to about 165ft below the surface of the area where Idalia is traveling through, a rare occurrence described as “other-worldly” by Andy Hazelton, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa). This level of ocean heat alone would be enough to make Idalia a devastating category 5 storm, scientists have said, although other factors such as wind shear will influence the ultimate outcome of the tempest. Hurricanes gather strength from warm oceans and moisture in the atmosphere, which are both facets of global heating. President Joe Biden is expected to give a speech this afternoon laying out his administration’s response to Hurricane Idalia. Biden will “deliver remarks on the whole-of-government response and recovery efforts on Maui, Hawaii and the ongoing response from the federal government to Hurricane Idalia”, CNN quoted a White House official as saying. The speech is scheduled to take place at 1.45pm eastern time (6.45pm BST). The National Weather Service’s office in Tallahassee has shared some clips showing Idalia’s impact as it made landfall. WWLP-22News’ Chris Bouzakis posted a video showing the storm surge in Horseshoe Beach, Florida: Here’s a clip of the storm surge racing up the Steinhatchee river, as shared by Fox Weather’s Mark Sudduth. The eye of the storm is moving just inland from Florida’s Big Bend coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. It says “catastrophic storm surge and damaging hurricane-force winds continue”. The eye of Hurricane Idalia made landfall along the coast of the Florida Big Bend near Keaton Beach around 7.45am Eastern time, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm’s maximum sustained winds were near 125 mph. Hurricane Idalia has officially made landfall near Keaton Beach, just north of Steinhatchee, Florida, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and even higher gusts. It is the strongest storm to make landfall in the area in more than 125 years. During Florida governor Ron DeSantis’ news conference this morning, the power flickered on and off and the lights briefly went out. “There we go with our power here,” DeSantis said, before the lights flickered back on. Currently there are about 130,833 Florida customers without power, according to poweroutage.us. A category 3 hurricane is still in “major hurricane” territory and does not diminish the dangers the storm presents. Earlier, the storm intensified into an extremely dangerous category 4 with winds of 130 mph. Idalia is now a category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph – only 5 mph from the previous update. It is expected to make landfall in Florida’s Big Bend region within the next hour. Hurricane Idalia has eased very slightly before landfall and is now a category 3 hurricane with 125mph winds and higher gusts. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center have warned that the change in wind speed “does not diminish the threat of catastrophic storm surge and damaging winds”. Florida governor Ron DeSantis urged people in affected areas not to go outside in the midst of the storm. If it’s calm where you are, it may be because you are in the eye of the storm and those conditions will change very, very quickly. He warned there will be impacts far beyond the eyeball that will extend to Tallahassee and north-east Florida. There have already been 11 tornado warnings and more tornadoes are possible, he said. DeSantis urged people to heed emergency officials’ warnings to take cover. Don’t put your life at risk by doing anything dumb at this point. This thing’s powerful. If you’re inside just hunker down until it gets past you. After the storm passes, people are urged not to drive in flooded streets, and to assume that all downed power lines are still hot and live. There are currently 54,000 households without power throughout the state, with more than 100,000 households who have restored power, he said. In addition, he said 33 ambulance strike teams and 5,500 national guardsmen who are ready to go, as well as the US coast guard on standby. DeSantis said in his early morning press conference that a storm surge could reach up to 16 feet (nearly 5m) in some areas of the Big Bend area. “That level of storm surge is life threating,” he said. A storm surge is the rising of the water level as a result of wind and atmosphere pressure changes associated with storms and can cause massive flooding. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is holding a press conference. He just said that “the full impact” of the hurricane will “most likely” hit in the next couple of hours. “Please hunker down,” he said. “Don’t mess with this storm.” He said the storm could hit Big Bend by 8am local time. That is is about an hour and ten minutes. Here is the latest update from the National Hurricane Center: Residents in northern Florida are rushing to evacuate as Hurricane Idalia is due to hit, with forecasters warning that it will come ashore as a category 4 storm with sustained winds of at least 130 mph (209km/h). Idalia grew to hurricane strength early on Tuesday and is predicted to slam into the Big Bend region on Florida’s Gulf coast early on Wednesday local time (in the next few hours). The National Hurricane Center has warned of “catastrophic storm surge and destructive winds” that it said “will begin soon”. States of emergency have been declared in Florida, North and South Carolina and Georgia. Residents of vulnerable coastal areas in Florida have been ordered to evacuate, with governor Ron DeSantis warning: “You really gotta go now. Now is the time.” In total, 28 of the state’s 67 counties are under evacuation orders. The storm’s path is expected to impact a wide central portion of the state, including cities such as Tampa and Orlando, and move close to the Carolina coastline on Thursday, the National Hurricane Center added. President Joe Biden has signed a federal order freeing up personnel and resources, including search and rescue teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

Russia said it has captured several strategic heights near Kupiansk, an eastern Ukrainian city where Moscow’s troops stepped up the pressure in August. A senior Ukrainian official has said that drone strikes on Russian soil were set to increase and that recent such attacks showed that the war in Ukraine was gradually shifting to Russia. President Vladimir Putin said Russia planned to allocate 1.9 trillion roubles (£15 billion) from the federal budget over the next two-and-a-half years to the development of the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow last year declared to be part of its territory. Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed 281 Ukrainian drones over the past week, including 29 over the western regions of Russia, indicating the scale of the drone war now underway between Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reports. The United States has seen notable progress by Ukrainian forces in the south near the Zaporizhzhia area in the last 72 hours, White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday. One man was killed in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Friday and three people were injured in a missile attack in the central region of Vinnytsia overnight, Ukrainian authorities said. Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky is expected to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York this month and take part in a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine, More than 2,000 troops from a Russia-led security alliance have opened military exercises in parts of Belarus near the borders of NATO countries. Denmark said Friday that it had told Russia to reduce the number of staff at its Copenhagen embassy following Russian requests for visas for “intelligence officers”. Two cargo vessels left a port near Odesa, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said on Friday – the third and fourth to transit from deep-water Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea since Russia withdrew from a safe-passage deal for grain ships. The head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said on Friday that the country’s Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, had been put on combat duty, state news agency RIA reported. The Kremlin said on Friday it took a negative view of British defence contractor BAE Systems’ decision to establish itself in Ukraine. It added that any facilities producing weapons used against Russia would become targets for Moscow’s military. Russia will block the final declaration of this month’s G20 summit unless it reflects Moscow’s position on Ukraine and other crises, leaving participants to issue a non-binding or partial communique, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday. Several Swedish lawmakers said Friday they will boycott this year’s Nobel Prize ceremonies after the private foundation that administers the prestigious awards changed its policy and invited Russia, Belarus and Iran who had previously been barred from attending. In its latest intelligence update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia had created an underwater barrier of submerged ships to deter attacks on the Crimean Bridge. Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the continuing conflict. Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky is expected to attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York this month and take part in a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine, Albania’s U.N. Ambassador Ferit Hoxha told reporters on Friday. Albania is president of the 15-member council for September. World leaders are due to begin gathering in New York from Sept. 18 for the high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. The Security Council meeting on Ukraine is due to be held on Sept. 20 Children across Russia have returned to school, where the Kremlin’s narratives about the war in Ukraine and its confrontation with the West are taking an even more prominent spot than before. Students are expected each week to listen to Russia’s national anthem and watch the country’s tricolor flag being raised, AP reports. There’s a weekly subject loosely translated as “Conversations about Important Things,” which was introduced last year with the goal of boosting patriotism. A new high school history textbook has a chapter on the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the “special military operation” — the Kremlin’s euphemism for the war, and some basic military training is included in a course on self-defence and first aid. More than 2,000 troops from a Russia-led security alliance have opened military exercises in parts of Belarus near the borders of NATO countries. The exercises of the Collective Security Treaty Organization include troops from Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. Armenia is also a member of the CSTO but did not send any of its forces, amid tense relations with Russia, AP reports. Belarus’ defence ministry says the exercises through Wednesday are to prepare for joint operations, including responses to a nuclear accident. The exercises are taking place in three western Belarus regions that border NATO members Poland and Lithuania. Poland’s foreign minister says the military exercises are aimed at destabilizing the region. Ukraine’s military intelligence said Friday that a recent drone attack on an airport in northwestern Russia which damaged several transport planes was carried out from within Russian territory. The claim, falling on the first day of the school year, came as President Vladimir Putin told Russian students that their country was “invincible” and police in Kyiv scrambled to respond to bomb threats in schools, AFP reports. The attack this week on Pskov airport some 700 kilometres (more than 400 miles) from Ukraine marked the latest strike to rock Russian territory since Kyiv vowed to “return” the conflict to Moscow in July. “The drones used to attack the ‘Kresty’ air base in Pskov were launched from Russia,” Ukraine’s intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on social media Friday. “Four Russian IL-76 military transport planes were hit as a result of the attack. Two were destroyed and two were seriously damaged,” he added. Budanov said the aircraft had been used by the defence ministry to transport troops and cargo. The Kremlin said this week that military experts were working to find out which routes the drones were taking in order “to prevent such situations in the future”. Asked about Ukrainian claims on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment and instead deferred questions to the defence ministry. Russia said it has captured several strategic heights near Kupiansk, an eastern Ukrainian city where Moscow’s troops stepped up the pressure in August.

Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the continuing conflict. Here are the latest images coming across the wires from Ukraine and Russia: Russia has said it captured several strategic heights near Kupiansk, an eastern Ukrainian city where Moscow’s troops stepped up pressure in August. Ukraine launched a counteroffensive against Russian positions in the south in June but Russia responded by trying to take back territory in the northeast, AFP reports. “In the direction of Kupiansk, units of the Western group of forces improved the tactical position by capturing enemy strongholds and key heights,” the Russian defence ministry said. It also claimed Ukrainian forces had sustained “significant” losses. Kupiansk and territory nearby in the Kharkiv region were retaken by Kyiv last September, but Moscow is pushing back. Ukrainian officials ordered vulnerable people to evacuate from several villages near Kupiansk, citing an uptick in Russian shelling. The Russian defence ministry Friday acknowledged that fighting in the south and east of Ukraine was “difficult”. It said Ukrainian military command was staging “meat grinder” assaults without providing sufficient cover for their troops. Denmark said Friday that it had told Russia to reduce the number of staff at its Copenhagen embassy following Russian requests for visas for “intelligence officers”. Denmark’s ministry of foreign affairs said the Russian mission would need to reduce its staff to match the level of the Danish embassy in Moscow, and that it had informed Russia’s ambassador Vladimir Barbin, AFP reports. The ministry said the move followed lengthy negotiations between the countries regarding visas for embassy employees. “The negotiations have not led to results due to repeated Russian attempts to include visa requests for Russian intelligence officers as part of these negotiations,” the ministry said. In practical terms, the embassy will be allowed to have five diplomats and 20 administrative and technical employees. “The decision to introduce parity in the size of the two embassies means that the Russian embassy in Copenhagen must reduce its current staffing,” the ministry said, adding the reduction needed to be completed by September 29. In April 2022, Denmark expelled 15 Russian diplomats it accused of being intelligence officers in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Several Swedish lawmakers said Friday they will boycott this year’s Nobel Prize ceremonies after the private foundation that administers the prestigious awards changed its policy and invited Russia, Belarus and Iran who had previously been barred from attending. The Nobel Foundation said that invitations for the 2023 events were extended to all countries with diplomatic missions in Sweden and Norway as that “promotes opportunities to convey the important messages of the Nobel Prize to everyone.” It was unclear whether the invitations have already been sent. Vidar Helgesen, the executive director of the Nobel Foundation, said in a statement Friday that there was a global trend in which “dialogue between those with differing views is being reduced.” To counter that, he said, “we are now broadening our invitations to celebrate and understand the Nobel Prize and the importance of free science, free culture and free, peaceful societies.” Last year, the diplomatic envoys of Russia and Belarus were barred from attending the prize ceremonies and banquets because of the war in Ukraine, and the ambassador of Iran was also excluded because of “the serious and escalating situation” in the country. The 2022 Nobel Peace Prize was shared by jailed Belarusian rights activist Ales Bialiatski, the Russian group Memorial and the Ukrainian organization Center for Civil Liberties. The prize was seen as a strong rebuke to the authoritarian rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told Swedish news agency TT he would not have allowed Russia to attend if it had been his choice. “To isolate Russia in every possible way — militarily, economically — it is necessary,” he told the TT news agency. Kristersson did not comment on whether he would boycott the event, but others were more forthright. Muharrem Demirok, the leader of Sweden’s small opposition Center Party, said that he had been looking forward to participating in the ceremony. “But as long as Russia is waging war against Ukraine, I cannot attend the same party as their ambassador.” Märta Stenevi, of the Green Party, agreed, saying “there is nothing to celebrate together with Russia’s ambassador.” Sweden’s employment minister, Johan Pehrson, writing on X — formerly known as Twitter — called the decision “extremely injudicious.” The foundation also announced that it was extending its invitation to all political parties in Sweden and Norway “that have parliamentary representation via democratic elections.” This year’s Nobel prize winners will be announced in early October. The United States has seen notable progress by Ukrainian forces in the south near the Zaporizhzhia area in the last 72 hours, White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Friday. Kirby also said he was not in a position to confirm reports that Russia’s nuclear-capable Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles were put on combat duty. A senior Ukrainian official said on Friday that drone strikes on Russian soil were set to increase and that recent such attacks showed that the war in Ukraine was gradually shifting to Russia. In an interview, presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak also ruled out peace talks for now, saying any negotiations would amount to “capitulation” on the part of Ukraine and the democracies that support it, Reuters reports. Ukraine had ramped up its strikes on occupied areas, and attacks inside Russia itself would also increase, carried out by “agents” or “partisans”, Podolyak said. “As for Russia … there is an increasing number of attacks by unidentified drones launched from the territory of the Russian Federation, and the number of these attacks will increase,” Podolyak said. “Because this is the stage of the war* when hostilities are gradually being transferred to the territory of the Russian Federation,” he said in the interview in his office in the heavily defended government district in Kyiv. President Vladimir Putin said Russia planned to allocate 1.9 trillion roubles (£15 billion) from the federal budget over the next two-and-a-half years to the development of the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow last year declared to be part of its territory, Reuters reports. Moscow does not control any of the regions in its entirety and the unilateral annexation has been recognised by only a handful of countries allied to Russia, while being condemned by Ukraine and three-quarters of U.N. member states. Ukrainian children began their second straight school year in wartime on Friday, some heading to new classrooms underground, Reuters reports. Russian air attacks have totally destroyed 1,300 schools since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, according to data by the UN Children’s Fund, which recorded damage to many other schools. The education minister, Oksen Lisovyi, reported this week that 84% of schools were now equipped with operational shelters. Here are some of the latest images coming out from the newswires: Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed 281 Ukrainian drones over the past week, including 29 over the western regions of Russia, indicating the scale of the drone war now under way between Russia and Ukraine, Reuters reports. “281 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed, including one Tu-141 Strizh, as well as 29 Ukrainian UAVs in the western regions of the Russian Federation,” the ministry said on Friday. Russia for its part has repeatedly struck Ukraine with waves of one-way drones with explosive payloads, which are far cheaper than missiles and can be difficult, and expensive, for air defence systems to intercept. Ukrainian aerial drone strikes deep inside Russia have increased since two drones were destroyed over the Kremlin in early May. Drone strikes on the Russian capital have become increasingly common in recent months. A Ukrainian drone on Friday attacked a town that is home to one of Russia’s biggest nuclear power stations, though no damage to the plant was reported, Russian officials said. A Russian military plane that took a Russian delegation to Burkina Faso on Thursday flew on and landed in Central African Republic on Friday, Reuters reports, citing Flightradar data. A security source in Bangui said a Russian delegation had arrived, without providing details. At the site of the plane crash which killed Yevgeny Prigozhin, a black Wagner flag flies beside a mound of rocks surrounded by flowers but all the debris of the private jet has been cleared, Reuters reports. At the crash site near the village of Kuzhenkino in Russia’s Tver region, there was no sign of the remains of the Embraer Legacy 600 jet, footage obtained by Reuters showed on Friday. All that remained was a makeshift stone memorial of four boulders to the mercenary chief surrounded by red carnations and a Wagner flag flying on a pole made from a tree branch. The flag sports a white skull surrounded by the words “PMC Wagner group” in both English and Russian. One man was killed in Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson on Friday and three people were injured in a missile attack in the central region of Vinnytsia overnight, Ukrainian authorities said. The 34-year-old man was hit in a residential area of Kherson close to 12:50pm local time, the military administration there said, according to Reuters. The three civilians were injured when a Russian missile struck a business in Vinnytsia region, the regional governor said (see post at 09.15). These claims are yet to be independently verified. Two cargo vessels left a port near Odesa, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said on Friday – the third and fourth to transit from deep-water Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea since Russia withdrew from a safe-passage deal for grain ships. The head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said on Friday that the country’s Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, had been put on combat duty, state news agency RIA reported. The Kremlin said on Friday it took a negative view of British defence contractor BAE Systems’ decision to establish itself in Ukraine. It added that any facilities producing weapons used against Russia would become targets for Moscow’s military. Russia will block the final declaration of this month’s G20 summit unless it reflects Moscow’s position on Ukraine and other crises, leaving participants to issue a non-binding or partial communique, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday. In its latest intelligence update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia had created an underwater barrier of submerged ships to deter against attacks on the Crimean Bridge. Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the continuing conflict. Reuters has more information on the two cargo vessels that left a port near Odesa (see earlier post at 10.08 for more details). Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the bulk carriers Anna-Theresa and Ocean Courtesy had left the port of Pivdennyi through a temporary corridor for civilian vessels. The Anna-Theresa and Ocean Courtesy were, respectively, carrying 56,000 metric tonnes of pig iron and 172,000 tonnes of iron ore concentrate, Kubrakov wrote on X. The head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos said on Friday that the country’s Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, had been put on combat duty, state news agency RIA reported. In June, Vladimir Putin said Sarmat missiles would be deployed for combat duty “soon”. Putin has repeatedly said since the start of the war in Ukraine that Russia is ready to use all means, including nuclear weapons, to defend its “territorial integrity”. Last year, the Russian president said he was placing territories seized in Ukraine – that Russia now claims as its own – under Moscow’s nuclear umbrella. But he has also said Russia has no need to resort to using nuclear weapons. Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom said on Friday that Russia’s nuclear energy infrastructure remained a target of Ukrainian strikes, Russian state news agency RIA reported. Earlier on Friday, Russian officials said a Ukrainian drone attacked a town in western Russia close to one of the country’s biggest nuclear power stations, though there was no damage reported to the plant. The Kremlin said it saw BAE Systems opening a local entity in Ukraine “negatively”, and that any production facilities producing weapons used against Russia would become targets for Moscow’s military, Reuters reports. Asked about the move in a call with reporters, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: Of course, any facilities for the production of weapons, especially if these weapons fire at us, they become objects of special attention for our military. BAE has said it would work directly with Kyiv to explore potential partners for a plan to ultimately produce 105mm light artillery guns in Ukraine and to better understand Ukraine’s requirements. As the UK’s biggest defence contractor, BAE has manufactured much of the equipment that Britain and other governments have provided to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion. BAE, which has benefited from increased defence spending as a result of the conflict, is already providing training and repair services to Ukraine’s armed forces. Russia will block the final declaration of this month’s G20 summit unless it reflects Moscow’s position on Ukraine and other crises, leaving participants to issue a non-binding or partial communique, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday. Lavrov is due to represent Russia at the 9-10 September meeting of the Group of 20 leading industrialised and developing countries in New Delhi. “There will be no general declaration on behalf of all members if our position is not reflected,” Lavrov told students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Lavrov said the west had raised Ukraine in meetings preparing for the summit, to which Russia had replied that “the issue is closed for us”, Reuters reports. He accused the west of undermining international institutions by pushing its own agenda and suggested that, if consensus could not be reached at the G20 meeting, a non-binding communique could be issued by the G20 presidency. “Another option is to adopt a document that focuses on specific decisions in the sphere of G20 competences, and let everyone say the rest on their own behalf,” Lavrov said. Vladimir Putin is not known to have travelled abroad since the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him in March on suspicion of war crimes in Ukraine. Last year, the G20 unanimously adopted a declaration saying most members condemned the war in Ukraine, but the document at the end of the summit acknowledged some countries saw the conflict differently. The Swedish foreign minister said on Friday he remained hopeful that Turkey would ratify Sweden’s planned Nato membership when the Turkish parliament reconvenes in October, as agreed with the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at a summit of the alliance in July. “The Swedish government has not had any signals during the summer other than that the cards that were put down then are ones that are valid now in this question and that the statement given at Vilnius is still valid,” Reuters quotes the foreign minister, Tobias Billström, as telling reporters. Sweden and Finland submitted simultaneous membership applications last May, abandoning decades of military nonalignment to seek security as Nato members after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Turkey soon abandoned its objections to Finland joining Nato, but the hope that the two Nordic nations would be able to join together was dashed when Erdoğan claimed Sweden had not done enough to rein in Kurdish separatist demonstrations there. Finland joined the alliance earlier this year while negotiations with Sweden continued. Two ships have been spotted leaving port in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, local lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko said on Friday. He also posted a photograph on the Telegram app that showed two ships in the water, Reuters reports. The date and location of the photo have not yet been independently verified. If they successfully leave Odesa’s ports through the Black Sea, they would be the third and fourth vessels to do so since Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea Grain deal in July. Odesa’s three seaports shipped tens of millions of tonnes of grain under a year-long UN-brokered deal. Russia threatened to treat all vessels as potential military targets after pulling out of the deal two months ago. In response, Ukraine announced a “humanitarian corridor” hugging the western Black Sea coast near Romania and Bulgaria. Regional governors in Russia said defence systems stopped three drones in the Kursk, Belgorod and Moscow regions, the Associated Press reports. Moscow airports briefly halted flights, but no major damage or injuries were reported, according to Russian authorities. Drones aimed at targets inside Russia – and blamed by Moscow on Ukraine – have become almost a daily occurrence as the war has entered its 19th month and Kyiv’s forces pursue a counteroffensive. Reuters has more information on reports of a long-range cruise missile hitting Vinnytsia, in central Ukraine, as we referenced in an earlier post (see 07.56). Ukrainian authorities now say three people were injured after Russian forces struck a private enterprise with the missile in Vinnytsia. “Unfortunately, there are victims – three civilians, they are being provided with all necessary assistance,” the regional governor, Serhiy Borzov, wrote on Telegram. He added that property and cars had been damaged. There cannot be “sustainable peace” in Ukraine unless the country regains control of Crimea, Donbas and other territories occupied by Russia, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at the European House Ambrosetti business forum in Italy on Friday. Russia has previously said it is open to peace talks with Kyiv but insists on its claim to four Ukrainian provinces it said it annexed last year and fully or partly controls, as well as Crimea that it annexed in 2014 – a condition Kyiv will not accept. Russian forces struck a private enterprise with a long-range cruise missile overnight in the central Ukrainian region of Vinnytsia, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday. The strike damaged property and caused an unspecified number of injuries, said the regional governor, Serhiy Borzov. “Unfortunately, there are victims, they are being provided with all necessary assistance,” he wrote on Telegram. Kyiv’s air force said it shot down one out of two incoming cruise missiles in the attack, Reuters reports. The missile was downed over the central Kirovohrad region, the governor said on Telegram. These claims are yet to be independently verified. In its latest intelligence update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia had created an underwater barrier of submerged ships to deter against attacks on the Crimean Bridge, which the country is logistically reliant upon. The MoD tweeted: The Kerch strait is a bottleneck for military logistics support to Russian forces in occupied areas of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Russia is heavily reliant on the Crimean Bridge and ferries to cross the straits. Russia is employing a range of passive defences such as smoke generators and underwater barriers, alongside active defence measures such as air defence systems, to strengthen the survivability of water crossings and minimise damage from future attacks. The bridge’s importance for both logistics and symbolism of Russian occupation mandates these extensive protection measures. As of 29 August 2023, imagery confirms Russia has created an underwater barrier of submerged ships and containment booms to deter against uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) attacks against the Crimean Bridge. At the southern part of the bridge, this includes several vessels 160 metres apart. These are located at the same place as the Ukrainian “Sea Baby” USV attacks on 17 July 2023. Previously, in September 2022, the Russian navy briefly trialled radar decoys on barges for several days, likely to deter radar-seeking missiles. The Crimean Bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, was built by Russia after it invaded and de-facto annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The 12-mile bridge, which includes a separate roadway and railway, spans the Kerch strait and connects Crimea with mainland Russia. You can read more about the bridge’s significance to the war in Ukraine here: A Ukrainian drone attacked a town in western Russia close to one of the country’s biggest nuclear power stations, though there was no damage reported to the plant, Russian officials said. The Kursk regional governor, Roman Starovoit, said a Ukrainian drone had damaged the facade of a building in the town of Kurchatov, just a few kilometres from the Kursk nuclear power station, early on Friday, Reuters reports. He had earlier said there were two drones but clarified his remarks. “There are no casualties,” Starovoit said. He did not mention any potential damage to the Kursk nuclear power plant. These claims are yet to be independently verified. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 3pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. The British defence company BAE Systems is setting up a local entity in Ukraine and has signed deals with its government to help ramp up its supply of weapons and equipment. BAE said it would work directly with Kyiv to explore potential partners for a plan to ultimately produce 105mm light artillery guns in Ukraine and to better understand Ukraine’s requirements. As the UK’s biggest defence contractor, BAE has manufactured much of the equipment that Britain and other governments have provided to Ukraine as it fends off Russia’s invasion. Britain is a key defence supplier for Ukraine and in May became the first country to start supplying Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. “The best weapons that are currently helping our warriors defend Ukraine should be produced in Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted after a meeting with the BAE chief executive, Charles Woodburn. “The development of our own weapons production is a top priority.” Voting in the elections held by Russia in occupied regions of Ukraine also began on Thursday in the Zaporizhzhia region, whose Russian-installed governor, Yevgeny Balitsky, held talks with Vladimir Putin in August shown on state television in which he said the province would return an emphatically pro-Kremlin vote. “We are sure that United Russia will receive the result it deserves in the elections,” Balitsky, a former pro-Russian MP in the Ukrainian parliament whose region is at the forefront of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, told Reuters. About 80% of it is controlled by Russia. Russian-installed authorities in the four regions extended voting over multiple days, saying it was necessary to reduce danger to voters. Data published by a Kremlin-controlled pollster in early August showed United Russia candidates drawing at least 80% of the vote across all four regions. According to independent Russian news site iStories, only around half of United Russia’s candidates in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions are local people, with the balance being drawn from Russia. Last year, Moscow said the four territories returned overwhelming votes in favour of annexation by Russia, in “referendums” Ukraine and its western allies said were fraudulent. More now on the illegal elections held by Russia in parts of occupied Ukraine. In the Donetsk region port city of Mariupol, which was taken by Russia in May 2022 after a grinding, months-long siege, Reuters saw electoral officials set up a temporary polling booth on Thursday in the courtyard of a residential complex. Reuters reports: A trickle of residents came out to cast their ballots, showing newly distributed Russian passports to officials while police officers stood by. Many people have fled Russian-occupied territory, which has suffered some of the worst damage of the conflict. The exiled Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boichenko, told Reuters people from the city, which he escaped on 26 February 2022, two days after Russia’s invasion, had told him there were no voter lists and no candidate lists. “It is clear that there is no trust from the people toward this process, which should be called a sham election,” he said in an interview in Kyiv, adding that he expected a repeat of what he said had happened in annexation votes last year. “They [Russian-installed officials] are going to walk from apartment to apartment, as they did before, talking to people. There are two soldiers standing nearby, carrying machine guns, and they tell the people that they must vote,” he said. Reuters could not immediately verify his account. Reuters: Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the continuing conflict. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions where the votes are being held – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Along with Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – they make up almost a fifth of Ukraine. Three-quarters of countries at the United Nations general assembly condemned what they termed Russia’s “attempted illegal annexation” of the four regions in a vote last October. Ukrainian officials say the elections are also illegal and show why it is impossible to hold any peace talks with Moscow until Russia withdraws all its troops from Ukrainian territory. In all four regions, Moscow’s handpicked governors, a mix of veteran pro-Russian politicians and others known only locally, are seeking full terms of office in the polls, which conclude on 10 September, when Russia holds regional polls. The governors are all running with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s endorsement having joined the Kremlin’s United Russia bloc with fanfare in recent months and they face only nominal opposition. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top story this morning: Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia illegally claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the continuing conflict.

Ukrainian officials say the elections are illegal and show why it is impossible to hold any peace talks with Moscow until Russia withdraws all its troops from Ukrainian territory. Reviving the Black Sea grain deal is “critical” for food security, Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said. During a joint media appearance with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, he said: “We underlined its critical role for global food security and stability in the Black Sea.” Russian-installed authorities began holding regional elections on Thursday in parts of Ukraine Russia claimed as its own last year, seeking to cement Moscow’s authority in what it calls its “new territories” despite the ongoing conflict. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions where the votes are being held – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Along with Crimea – annexed by Moscow in 2014 – they make up almost a fifth of Ukraine. The Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, criticised what he called “stupid demands” from Poland and the Baltic states for Wagner fighters sheltering in his country to leave, AFP reported. Wagner fighters took refuge in Belarus after their short-lived rebellion against Moscow’s military leadership in June, prompting concerns from neighbouring countries. Ukrainian troops achieved some new “successes” in the south and east as they tried to advance their counteroffensive against Russian forces, the deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said. Kyiv’s forces have been making slow progress against Russian minefields and trenches that have blocked a Ukrainian push in the south intended to reach the Sea of Azov and split Russian forces, the Associated Press reported. The alleged co-founder and military commander of the Russian mercenary group Wagner, Dmitry Utkin, was buried near Moscow on Thursday. British defence company BAE Systems said on Thursday it had set up a local entity in Ukraine and signed deals with the government there to help ramp up Kyiv’s supply of weapons and equipment. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has hit out at critics of Kyiv’s tactics in its counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion, saying they were spitting in the faces of Ukrainian soldiers and should “shut up”. Royal Navy warships and RAF patrol aircraft have tracked a series of Russian warships as they travelled close to the UK including through the Channel. Two Ukrainian “saboteurs” were killed and five captured during an incursion into the region of Bryansk, a Russian official reportedly said on Thursday. Separately, Russia reportedly said on Thursday it intended to develop ties with North Korea. A newly released video of Yevgeny Prigozhin purports to show the Wagner group boss in Africa addressing rumours about his wellbeing and threats to his life, just days before his death. The UK government has named ex-energy secretary Grant Shapps as the new defence secretary. A former chief of the general staff of the British army said Shapps knows “very little about defence” and it will take him “quite some time to get up to speed”. A military spokesperson said Ukrainian armed forces are making progress in the direction of Novoprokopivka – the village beyond Robotyne, in the direction of Melitopol. Russia’s air defences are struggling to detect and destroy Ukrainian drones launched on its territory, judging by how many have reached their targets, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has decried corrupt medical exemptions that have enabled people to avoid military service, saying the system was subject to bribes and mass departures abroad."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-17T04:10:49Z","webTitle":"New Zealand MP says Rocket Lab launches could betray country’s anti-nuclear stance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/17/new-zealand-mp-says-rocket-lab-launches-could-betray-countrys-anti-nuclear-stance","fields":{"bodyText":"A New Zealand commercial space company, Rocket Lab, has faced new opposition to its activities on behalf of foreign militaries, with one New Zealand Green MP saying its actions could fly in the face of the country’s anti-nuclear stance. The American-New Zealand company, founded by Peter Beck in 2006, provides rockets to deliver payloads into orbit from its launch site on the Māhia Peninsula, in New Zealand’s north. A third of Rocket Lab’s activities have been on behalf of defence and national security agencies. These include launching US and Australian spy satellites, the controversial “Gunsmoke J” satellite, and most recently Nasa’s capstone spacecraft. The company’s contracts with the US have been flagged as concerning by the Māhia community, the Green party, and Rocket Lab Monitor – a watchdog group. In 2019, the New Zealand government banned launch activities that were not in the country’s national interest, or were a breach of both domestic and international laws. The minister for economic and regional development, Stuart Nash, who is also the MP for the area that covers the Māhia Peninsula, has the ability to veto space launches that are not considered to be in the national interest, including payloads that contribute to nuclear weapons programmes or support or enable specific defence, security or intelligence operations contrary to government policy. But the Green party’s security and intelligence spokesperson, Teanau Tuiono warned last week that it is “unclear when the national interest test should be invoked” and that there is no guarantee the satellites will not be used to assist nuclear programmes. “Weaponising space is not in our national interest and goes against our international commitments to ensuring peace in space,” he said. “Launching space satellites from Aotearoa could improve the ability of foreign actors to control a nuclear explosive device,” Tuiono said. “But right now, the government is allowing operators like Rocket Lab to put payloads into space for the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the US Space Force.” Tuiono said that this poses a risk to New Zealand’s nuclear-free stance, which was enshrined in law more than 35 years ago and is considered a defining moment in the country’s history. “We risk betraying the anti-nuclear generation and handing our kids a less safe world,” Tuiono said. Rocket Lab has said its launches do not facilitate the command and control of nuclear weapons and, in a statement to the Guardian, said New Zealand has one of the most stringent regulatory systems for space activity in the world. “The Government has been clear that it will not allow a launch from New Zealand if the satellite contributes to nuclear weapons programmes or capabilities”, the statement said. “Rocket Lab supports this clear and robust policy.” “Launching satellites for defence forces does not automatically equate to launching weapons,” they said, adding that New Zealand relies on satellite technology operated by international militaries, including for communications for disaster relief and monitoring the exclusive economic zone. Satellite customers are required to disclose what their mission is to the government, and include the purpose, capabilities and objectives of putting the satellite into space, Rocket Lab said. Watchdog group, Rocket Lab Monitor, has said it’s skeptical that this is a fail-proof system and worries the country’s space agency lacks in-house expertise to assess if satellites are contributing to nuclear weapon programmes. “It all relies on the ‘intent’ of a payload rather than monitoring what it actually ends up being used for,” its spokesperson Sonya Smith said. Smith pointed to Rocket Lab’s 2021 launch of the “Gunsmoke-J” satellite – an experimental satellite that, according to the US army, can “provide tactically actionable targeting data” to “warfighters”, and to which Minister Nash admitted he was “unaware of [its] specific military capabilities”. Last month, the government announced a new aerospace strategy, that includes further financial support for the emerging sector. At the same time, it opened a review to allow the public to give feedback on the future of New Zealand’s space policy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T01:04:46Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 445 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-445-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has landed in Berlin, according to a post on the Ukrainian president’s Twitter feed, as he seeks to shore up support from key allies. “Already in Berlin,” Zelenskiy tweeted shortly after midnight on Sunday, arriving from Italy where he met with Italian officials and Pope Francis. The German government has announced a further €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package since the Russian invasion. Russian missiles struck the home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry during the song contest. Ternopil, the university home town of electronic music duo Tvorchi, was among the places targeted, according to Dame Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine. Local authorities said the strike had hit warehouses owned by commercial enterprises and a religious organisation, injuring two people. The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining north-east Ukraine. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will push other global leaders to pledge more support for Ukraine when he attends international summits next week, according to his office. Sunak will travel to Iceland on Tuesday to meet other European leaders attending a Council of Europe summit. South Africa’s presidential security adviser said the country was “actively non-aligned” in Russia’s war against Ukraine, after US allegations it had supplied weapons to Moscow led to a diplomatic crisis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and urged him to help implement Kyiv’s peace plan to end the war. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military cooperation in Asia and believes the two countries are strengthening their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started and that Russia’s invasion had “shaken the very foundation of the international order”. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed while 10 more were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, Poland’s defence ministry said on Saturday. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force said a search for the object was under way. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have said. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-25T15:00:37Z","webTitle":"Court allows Trevor St Baker to invoke right against self-incrimination in case alleging corporate misconduct against ERM Power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/25/trevor-st-baker-excused-from-making-disclosures-in-court-case-alleging-corporate-misconduct-at-erm-power","fields":{"bodyText":"The Queensland energy baron Trevor St Baker has invoked his right against self-incrimination in a court case brought by a former executive at ERM Power, who alleges he uncovered “sham transactions” and insider trading. A Queensland supreme court ruling last week found that St Baker and his son, Philip, along with nine other former directors of ERM Power, should be excused from making certain disclosures in the case because doing so would expose them to “a real and appreciable risk of criminal prosecution”. St Baker, a prominent energy investor and a major donor to the Liberal National party, founded his former flagship ERM Power in the 1980s and was the company’s largest shareholder when it was acquired by Shell for $617m in 2019. The next year a former executive at ERM, Kent Quinlan, filed a civil case in the Queensland supreme court, claiming he made whistleblower disclosures about corporate misconduct at the publicly listed company in 2012. Quinlan is suing ERM Power, an associated company and 11 former directors for breach of contract, breach of statutory duty and breach of confidence. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The supreme court decision says Quinlan alleges he investigated two apparent “sham” transactions in 2012 that artificially inflated ERM’s profits. Court documents allege these transactions, including one with the Queensland government power company Stanwell Corporation, “were calculated to artificially enhance ERM’s market value in a way which misled and deceived investors”. It is alleged that Quinlan held a reasonable belief that the transactions were artificial or fictitious, liable to mislead the market and ERM’s shareholders, and were in contravention of the law. Trevor St Baker stepped down as chairman of ERM in 2011, a year before the alleged sham transactions. He remained a director until 2017 and the major shareholder until 2019. He is not personally accused of corporate misconduct in the court filing. Philip St Baker was the managing director and chief executive of ERM from 2006 to 2014. Quinlan alleges Philip St Baker “engaged in insider trading in the purchase of shares by his family share trading account on two occasions”. The St Bakers have been approached for comment via their legal team. Quinlan alleges he was entitled to protections as a whistleblower but had been subject to 25 separate “vindictive stratagems” by ERM and various directors between 2012 and 2020. In a preliminary judgment handed down last week, Justice Sue Brown excused the defendants, including Trevor and Philip St Baker and nine other former directors of ERM, from making certain disclosures. Trevor and Philip St Baker, and the other nine directors, had asked the supreme court to be excused from disclosing certain information and documents in the case on the grounds that “there is a real and appreciable risk of self-incrimination or exposure to penalty if they are not relieved from compliance with the pleading rules”. “According to [Trevor and Philip St Baker] that risk is revealed by the serious allegations made … Mr Quinlan’s own statements, the significant media attention the proceeding has received, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s statements in its enforcement priorities,” the judgment said. “[Trevor and Philip St Baker] also refer to Asic media releases from 2022 which refer to Asic’s interest in taking action in relation to insider trading and market manipulation. “I am satisfied that [Trevor and Philip St Baker] have a real and appreciable risk of criminal prosecution or commencement of civil penalty proceedings which is reasonably held given that Mr Quinlan expressed an intention to lodge a complaint with Asic … the media attention of the proceeding, and Asic’s stated priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-05T21:46:49Z","webTitle":"Poland suggests hosting US nuclear weapons amid growing fears of Putin’s threats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/05/poland-us-nuclear-wars-russia-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Poland says it has asked to have US nuclear weapons based on its territory, amid growing fears that Vladimir Putin could resort to using nuclear arms in Ukraine to stave off a rout of his invading army. The request from the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, is widely seen as symbolic, as moving nuclear warheads closer to Russia would make them more vulnerable and less militarily useful, according to experts. Furthermore, the White House has said it had not received such a request. “We’re not aware of this issue being raised and would refer you to the government of Poland,” a US official said. Duda’s announcement appears to be the latest example of nuclear signalling as the US and its allies seek to deter Putin from the first nuclear use in battle since 1945, while preparing potential responses if deterrence fails that would have maximum punitive impact while containing the risk of escalation to all-out nuclear war. Previous war games conducted by US administrations have shown that is a fine, and fuzzy, line to tread, given the uncertainty over Putin’s state of mind, and his record of giant miscalculations over Ukraine. Duda’s remarks on basing nuclear weapons followed changes in the constitution of neighbouring Belarus that would allow Russian nuclear weapons to be based on its territory. The Polish president said there was “a potential opportunity” for Poland to take part in “nuclear sharing”, by which pilots from the host country are trained to fly missions carrying US nuclear bombs, which are stored on their territory. “We have spoken with American leaders about whether the United States is considering such a possibility. The issue is open,” Duda told Gazeta Polska. Moving US nuclear weapons into Poland could be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Nato-Russia Founding Act in 1997, after the end of the cold war in which Nato stated it had no plan to deploy nuclear weapons on the territory of new members. Russia has meanwhile violated its own commitments under the act. Nuclear experts also added it made little strategic sense for Poland or Nato. The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) estimates the US has 100 nuclear weapons left over in Europe in the aftermath of the cold war, spread among the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey. They are all B61 bombs which had been seen as militarily obsolete with no mission in the event of a war with Russia. Arms control experts have long called for them to be removed from Europe. However, they have been modernised as the B61-12, with fins that allow its fall to be guided, which is expected to enter service this year. The bombs have also been designed to be carried by new F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jets, which would potentially make it part of the active US nuclear arsenal. Hans Kristensen, director of FAS’s nuclear information project, said the B61-12 storage sites in Europe are being upgraded and strengthened. “The reason they’re doing that is to protect that force against what they consider the growing threat from Russia’s conventional missiles, so it would be an extraordinarily strange development if Nato therefore decided to move nuclear weapons closer to the Russian borders,” Kristensen said. Poland has raised the issue at a time when the prospect of nuclear weapons use is higher than at any time since the cold war, and arguably since the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago this month. Putin has threatened to use all means at his disposal to defend Russian territory at the same time as declaring the annexation of four more Ukrainian regions. He made the declaration as Russian troops were in retreat in the face of a Ukrainian counter-offensive. The White House has warned of “catastrophic consequences” if Putin did resort to using nuclear weapons, but did not specify what those would be. It has said it has warned Russian officials privately, but it is not clear how much more specific those warnings have been. Zbigniew Rau, the Polish foreign minister, said last week the consequences should be non-nuclear but “devastating”. David Petraeus, who was formerly the head of US Central Command and CIA director, said on Sunday that one possible response would be US-led Nato conventional strikes on Russian forces inside Ukraine and even the sinking of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. In reality, Nato is unlikely to be part of any response, as it would require agreement by its 30 members. More likely it would involve Washington and its closest allies like the UK. “There are ongoing discussions and have been for a while about various scenarios and how we might react,” an official in Washington said. US European Command is also doing scenario planning, the official said, adding that “there is no concrete set of actions” planned. The dilemma facing the military planners is how to act in such a way that Putin does not benefit militarily from using a nuclear weapon, but not so forcefully that escalation spins out of control and leads inexorably to nuclear war between Nato and Russia. Much would depend on what Putin did. The Russians could stage a “demonstration” nuclear detonation over the Black Sea, or a high-altitude airburst that generates an electromagnetic pulse that fries the electricity infrastructure of any city below. Those actions, however, would cause international outrage with little if any effect on the course of the war. The use of a nuclear weapon against Ukrainian military targets or a city, with the aim of shocking Kyiv into surrender or acceptance of partial Russian occupation would represent a far greater transgression. The range of responses in that case would include further sanctions, including secondary sanctions targeting anyone or any country buying Russian oil. Stepping up arms supplies to Kyiv, including longer-range missiles and jets the Ukrainians have been demanding, is another option. Actual Nato strikes against Russian military targets in Ukraine, would represent a huge leap, turning the conflict into a war between Russia and Nato, something policymakers have spent nearly 80 years trying to prevent. “The reaction to nuclear use would be just as important as the nuclear use itself,” Mariana Budjeryn, senior research associate at the project on managing the atom at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Centre. “If it does force Ukraine into some kind of settlement and the allies think we’re throwing in the towel on this, then it does show that, hey, nuclear arms really get you what you want,” Budjeryn said. “If nuclear weapons are used, and that only makes everyone a lot more upset and hardens the resolve and somehow stops Russia in its tracks, then it’s a different story.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T18:00:13Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: object found near Nord Stream 2 ‘no safety risk’; Bakhmut battle has ‘badly damaged’ Wagner forces – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-fears-war-could-be-hampered-by-washington-divisions-moscow-starts-drills-with-new-icbm","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday. Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light on Wednesday for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said on Wednesday. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region” and that there were “no casualties or damage”. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties and that unemployment “remains at an all-time low”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy also extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him.” Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. We’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for following. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has made a second visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine amid an escalation in the fighting around it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” Read the full story here: The German government has agreed to send an additional €12bn worth of military support to Ukraine, in a further shift away from its traditional pacifist stance. The Bundestag’s budget committee gave the green light today for about €8bn to be spent directly on purchasing weapons and equipment for Ukraine, approving a request by the German defence ministry and foreign office. The other €4bn will go to the German military to replenish stocks. About €12bn in total will be released related to the Ukraine conflict over the next decade or so. Since the start of the Russian invasion, the German government has made available more than €14.2bn in support for Ukraine, according to the foreign office. In a statement, three lawmakers representing the coalition government on the committee said: With the money, Ukraine can directly buy armaments with the support of the German government. The move represents a “very important step with which we make it clear that we are supporting Ukraine in the long term in its fight against Putin,” said Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius. The agreement will allow supplies including armoured vehicles, tanks, and ammunition to be delivered to Ukraine in the coming years, according to a statement from the minister. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has responded to remarks by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov who earlier today said Russia’s “hybrid war” against “hostile states” will continue “for a long time”. Peskov and Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, are both “wrong: the war can be ended diplomatically”, Podolyak posted to Twitter. He called on Russian forces to immediately withdraw from occupied parts of Ukraine, adding that “a reboot must happen in Moscow for that”. An explosion has been reported near a Russian military airbase in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, according to footage shared on social media. The Russian-appointed head of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, posted to Telegram that “a UAV [drone] was shot down in the Simferopol region”. He added: It crashed in a field. There were no casualties or damage. It has not been possible to independently verify his claim. A letter from a Russian girl who drew anti-war pictures at school, addressed to her father who has reportedly fled house arrest after being sentenced to two years after being convicted of discrediting the armed force, has been made public. Alexei Moskalyov, a single parent from the town of Yefremov, 150 miles south of Moscow, was detained by police and placed under house arrest at the start of this month. His daughter Masha was moved to a state-run shelter. On Tuesday, a court spokesperson said Moskalyov had fled house arrest overnight and his whereabouts are currently not known. A human rights lawyer, Dmitry Zakhvatov, has since said Moskalyov had been in touch with him and sent him a copy of a letter that Masha had written him from the children’s home. The letter reads: Hi Dad, I really ask you not to get sick and not to worry. Everything is fine with me, I love you very much and know that you’re not guilty of anything. I am always on your side, and everything you do is right. It ends with “I love you” in English, and the words “you are a hero” inside a heart. The family said they had faced pressure from police since last April when Masha, a sixth-grader, refused to participate in a patriotic class at her school and made several drawings showing rockets being fired at a family standing under a Ukrainian flag and another that said “Glory to Ukraine!” School officials at the time summoned the police, who questioned the girl and threatened her father. He was eventually charged with discrediting the armed forces for his social media posts in which he called the Russian regime “terrorists” and described the Russian army as “rapists”. The high-profile case was criticised by Russian human rights groups and led to an online campaign to reunite father and daughter. Russian authorities have put a member of the feminist punk group Pussy Riot on a wanted list for criminal suspects, according to an interior ministry database. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova is on Russia’s federal wanted list, Russian news outlet Mediazona has reported. The entry said Tolokonnikova faces criminal charges, but it did not specify what the charges are. Tolokonnikova left Russia and reportedly lives in the US. She was designated a “foreign agent” by the Russian government in 2021. My colleague Zoe Williams interviewed Tolokonnikova in March last year. Vladimir Putin has conceded that sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine could bring about “negative” consequences for the country, but insisted Moscow was adapting to the penalties. Putin, in a televised meeting with the government, said: The sanctions imposed against the Russian economy in the medium term could really have a negative impact. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry, has shared the clip: During the meeting, Putin said unemployment in Russia “remains at an all-time low” and that inflation is expected to “drop below 4%” by the end of March after soaring in spring last year. However the “return to a growth trajectory should not make us feel relaxed”, he said. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Tthe UN’s nuclear agency chief, Rafael Grossi, has said the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”.

Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit Ukraine. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country.

Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, the Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles said. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Ukraine’s sports ministry has condemned what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described the IOC’s decision as “shameful”. Good afternoon from London, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest news from the Russia-Ukraine war. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Poland has urged the EU to limit the amount of Ukrainian grain entering the bloc’s market, its prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said, amid anger among farmers over the effect of imports on Polish grain prices. Morawiecki said he had agreed with the leaders of several countries bordering Ukraine to write to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, to demand action. Morawiecki, at a news conference, said: We demand the use of all regulatory instruments - quotas, tariffs, which will limit or block the import of Ukrainian grain into Poland. Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, has been forced to find alternative shipping routes through Poland and Romania, after its Black Sea ports were blocked following Russia’s invasion. But logistical bottlenecks have meant large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the EU, have ended up in central Europen countries, Reuters reports. The influx of Ukrainian grain has damaged prices and sales of local farmers, and caused a major headache for Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party in an election year. Here are some images we have received from the news wires of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi visiting Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been held by Russian forces for more than a year. Ukraine’s sports ministry condemned on Wednesday what it said was a partial change of position by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in international competitions as neutrals. “The ministry of youth and sports of Ukraine condemns the partial change of the position of the International Olympic Committee regarding the non-admission of Russian and Belarusian athletes,” Reuters reports the Ukrainian ministry said in a statement. “We have consistently advocated and will continue to insist that under the conditions of the unprecedented unprovoked military aggression of the Russian Federation with the support of the republic of Belarus against Ukraine, which contradicts the principles of the Olympic charter, representatives of aggressor states should not be present at international sports arenas.” Reuters is carrying a quick snap that the Danish energy agency says that the object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Rafael Grossi, the UN’s nuclear agency chief, has told the media in Russia that the situation is not improving at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant after visiting Zaporizhzhia in an occupied region of Ukraine. While on the Russian-held territory, Grossi told Russian news agencies including Tass that “Obviously, the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” Tass reports that he was shown “objects damaged as a result of shelling by the armed forces of Ukraine”. Russian forces have occupied the plant since March 2022, forcing Ukrainian staff to continue working while under occupation. Russia has claimed that Ukraine has shelled both the station and the nearby residential area of Enerhodar. Ukraine has claimed that shelling has been by Russian forces. Grossi previously visited the site in September 2022. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, Reuters is reporting the Spanish defence minister, Margarita Robles, as saying. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s, Robles told lawmakers, adding that Spain had repaired them and would test their combat readiness before shipping them to support Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Russia’s invasion. Spain will repair another four tanks that will be sent “in the near future”, she added. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group, has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but that his forces have also been “badly damaged”. In an audio message, Prigozhin said: The battle for Bakhmut today has already practically destroyed the Ukrainian army and, unfortunately, it has also badly damaged the Wagner private military company. Asked about Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s promise to defend Bakhmut to the end, CNN reported Prigozhin as saying his forces would win in “the greatest turn in this war and in all modern history”. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has condemned the International Olympic Committee’s recommendation that Russian and Belarusian athletes compete as neutrals, describing the decision as “shameful”. Speaking at a news conference, Morawiecki said Poland would build “a coalition of states to together demand that the IOC withdraw this bad and wrong decision”. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said. Ryabkov, in remarks carried by Interfax news agency, said: There will be no notifications at all. All notifications, all kinds of notifications, all activities under the treaty will be suspended and will not be conducted regardless of what position the US may take. The 2010 New Start treaty, the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia, limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads each side can deploy. The US and Russia hold nearly 90% of the world’s nuclear warheads between them. Vladimir Putin announced last month that Russia was suspending participation in the treaty, accusing Washington of trying to inflict a “strategic defeat” on Russia in Ukraine. Ryabkov’s remarks reflect a change of course, after the Russian foreign ministry initially said it would continue notifying the US about planned test launches of its ballistic missiles. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. A spokesperson for the US national security council said yesterday: Under international law, the United States has the right to respond to Russia’s breaches of the New Start treaty by taking proportionate and reversible countermeasures in order to induce Russia to return to compliance with its obligations. It comes as Russia conducted drills of its strategic missile forces today, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s nuclear capability. A Siberian journalist whose news website published content that was critical of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has gone on trial charged with discrediting Moscow’s armed forces, according to a report. Mikhail Afanasyev, one of the best-known journalists in Siberia and chief editor of Novy Fokus in the Russian region of Khakassia, was arrested by security forces in April 2022. His arrest came after the website’s reporting on 11 riot police officers who allegedly refused deployment to Ukraine. He was accused of disseminating “deliberately false information” about the Russian armed forces, an offence that carries a maximum jail sentence of 10 years under a law passed last year. My colleague Andrew Roth reported on Afanasyev’s arrest last April: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. She said: I strongly recommend that Russian citizens do not adopt Ukrainian orphans who were illegally taken out of the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine. Nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children are currently considered illegally deported to Russia or Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s ministry of integration of occupied territories. Russia says it has been evacuating people voluntarily from Ukraine, and claims it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict zone. Russia’s defence ministry said in mid-August that 3.5m people had been brought to Russia by then, including more than half a million children. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, 464 children have died so far since the war began in February last year. Police have estimated that 356 are still missing. Writing on her Telegram account today, Vereshchuk added: Once again I remind all Russian so-called ‘adoptive parents’ and ‘guardians’: sooner or later you will have to answer. The international criminal court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant earlier this month against President Vladimir Putin and his commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting Ukrainian children. More than 220,000 Russian personnel have been killed or injured since its troops invaded Ukraine more than a year ago, Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said, citing the latest US assessment. From Sky News’ Deborah Haynes: Russia’s “confrontation with hostile states” is “going to last for a long time”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said. My colleague Pjotr Sauer reports: Here’s more from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where the Ukrainian president extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. Zelenskiy, who has not spoken to Xi since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year, said: We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have. The Chinese leader invited Vladimir Putin to visit Beijing this year during a meeting in Moscow earlier this month. Asked if Xi would accept Zelenskiy’s invitation, or whether one had been officially extended, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters she had no information to give. She added that Beijing maintains “communication with all parties concerned, including Ukraine”. In response to Zelenskiy’s interview, the Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, has arrived the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southeastern Ukraine, a spokesperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed. The IAEA chief is visiting Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since near the beginning of the invasion, to review the situation there, the spokesperson said. They said: At the plant now. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here taking over the live blog from Martin Belam. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is due to visit the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, with Russian media outlets reporting he has arrived. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. Russia’s state-owned news agency RIA has reported that the UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi has now arrived at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since very near the beginning of the invasion. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, is reporting that there are power outages in some areas of Kyiv and also Odesa which have been caused by weather conditions, rather than enemy action. It writes: In Kyiv and the region, due to worsening weather conditions, emergency shutdowns of lights were used. Most of them are at the Vyshhorod, Kyiv-Sviatoshyn, and Vasylkiv power stations, DTEK reported. There are also stabilizing power outages in some areas of the capital and the region. In Odesa, seven settlements remain without power due to bad weather. Russia’s embassy in the US has issued a punchy statement overnight in response to what it says are “statements of a number of US administration officials on support for the creation of a special tribunal against Russia”. It writes on its official Telegram channel: Such comments are an outright profanity that has nothing to do with justice. The US continues to demonstrate a complete disregard for the norms of international law in favour of its own geopolitical interests. The outrageous and unfounded accusations of alleged aggression, crimes against humanity and other violations are nothing more than an element of the Russophobic campaign organised by Washington as part of the hybrid war unleashed against us. The US hypocritically and cynically refrains from assessing the criminal acts of the nazis who have settled in Kyiv and have been terrorising civilians for many years. Washington is silent about its own role in the incitement of the Ukrainian conflict. It continues to support [the] Zelenskiy regime through the endless supply of lethal weapons, as a result of which the civilian population continues to die, including children, and kindergartens, schools and hospitals are destroyed. How may Washington speculate on “responsibility for aggression”, when the international community has not yet recovered from the catastrophic consequences of American adventurist interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, bombing of Yugoslavia and the atrocities in Vietnam? Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”, Reuters reports, citing news agency TT. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”. State-owned news agency Tass quotes him saying: Despite the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states, all the declared goals of the special military operation will certainly be achieved. We will achieve the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, ensure the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation and the security of our population. Late last year the Russian Federation claimed to annex four regions of Ukraine after organising widely derided “referendums” in the regions which they partially occupied. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, in a move not widely recognised by the international community. An IAEA spokesperson has confirmed that UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi was on his way to the plant. He said Grossi was in the Zaporizhzhia region, but declined to say where. According to Reuters, he shared a photograph of Grossi standing in body armour by an armoured UN car on the side of a road. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday, Reuters reports. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. More from that Associated Press interview with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where Ukraine’s president was unstinting in his criticism of his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy said Putin was an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia. President Xi Jinping has recently attended a state visit in Moscow, and extended an invitation to Putin to visit Beijing. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Despite Putin’s nuclear provocations, and some of the harsh rhetoric that has come from his allies such as Dmitry Medvedev, Zelenskiy told AP he does not believe the Russian leader is prepared to use the bomb. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, offers this news round-up of the latest developments on its official Telegram channel: In the morning, a series of explosions rang out in the temporarily occupied Melitopol in Zaporizhzhia. The lights went out in some areas of the city and settlements. During the day, the Russian army launched 34 airstrikes and artillery strikes on the de-occupied part of Kherson region, three on Kherson. It struck houses, a hospital and a post office. One person is injured. At night, the Ukrainian military destroyed a Russian Su-24M bomber in the direction of Bakhmut, the air force reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Journalists from Associated Press accompanied Volodymyr Zelenskiy on part of his trip this week around frontline regions of Ukraine, and to the border region of Sumy. During that time, Ukraine’s president reiterated requests for more modern weaponry, and also said some elements that had been supplied by the west had not worked. “We have great decisions about Patriots, but we don’t have them for real,” he said, referring to the US-made air defence system that has been promised. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. Zelenskiy added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy also reiterated his longstanding request for fighter jets, saying: “We still don’t have anything when it comes to modern warplanes.” Poland and Slovakia have decided to give Soviet-era fighter jets to Ukraine, but no western country so far has agreed to provide modern warplanes, through concerns that it might escalate the conflict and provide Ukraine with strike capabilities deep into Russian territory, and that the length of time that it would take to train pilots and provision ground crews makes the delivery in the short-term impractical. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. “The cessation of its export activities on the Russian market will not affect the volume of domestic grain shipments abroad. The company’s grain export assets will continue to operate regardless of who manages them,” the agriculture ministry said in a comment to Reuters. A spokesperson for Cargill’s Russian unit declined to comment to the news agency. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured due to the war. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. “Thus Hungary’s gas supply will continue without any disruptions,” the statement added. That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan. My colleague Martin Belam will take you through the rest of the day’s news. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Microsoft said in a threat assessment earlier this month that Russian actors had launched attacks in at least 17 European countries in the first six weeks of this year. Thales and Microsoft said Russia’s invasion was accompanied by widespread cyberattacks in Ukraine, but they were repelled. Both firms said Russia shifted focus to other European countries late last year. “In the third quarter of 2022, Europe was dragged into a high-intensity hybrid cyberwar at a turning point in the conflict,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Thales vice president for cyber solutions. Jolivet said countries outside Ukraine were suffering a “massive wave” of DDoS attacks, when a server is flooded with requests that crash the network. These attacks were increasingly carried out by “hacktivist” groups aligned with the Kremlin rather than official groups, and they aimed to sow chaos rather than destroy infrastructure, Thales said. Poland, Latvia and Sweden were among the most affected countries, the Thales report said. Microsoft said in its assessment that attacks this year in Europe were largely aimed at government entities for espionage purposes. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Russia’s state TASS news agency, citing Moscow-installed officials in the area, said Ukrainian shelling had damaged the city’s power supply system and knocked out electricity in the city and some nearby villages. TASS also reported that a locomotive depot was destroyed but according to initial information, there were no casualties. The Guardian has not verified these reports independently. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, is visiting the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine today. He has described the situation there as very dangerous. He said in an interview with Reuters that his work on forging an agreement to protect Europe’s largest nuclear power station was still alive. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the site. The nuclear facility has lost its external power supply six times since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, forcing emergency diesel generators to kick in to cool its reactors. Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the water level in a nearby reservoir controlled by Russian forces was another potential danger. Water supplied by the reservoir is used to cool the reactors. He told Reuters yesterday: If the reservoir level goes down beyond a certain level, then you don’t have water to cool down the reactors, and we have seen especially in January that the levels of the water were going down significantly. They recovered somehow in the past few weeks. He added that there had been increasing military activity in the region without giving details. Grossi said his attempt to broker a deal to protect the plant was still alive, and that he was adjusting the proposals to seek a breakthrough. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength, Reuters reports. President Vladimir Putin has aimed to make the Yars missile system, which replaced the Topol system, part of Russia’s “invincible weapons” and the mainstay of the ground-based component of its nuclear arsenal. “In total, more than 3,000 military personnel and about 300 pieces of equipment are involved in the exercises,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Telegram. The drills involve the Strategic Missile Forces comprehensive control checking of the Omsk missile formation together with a command and staff exercise with the Novosibirsk missile formation equipped with the Yars systems. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in an interview that he he worries the war could be affected by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. Following its long interview with Ukraine’s leader, AP reports: Zelenskiy is well aware that his country’s success has been in great part due to waves of international military support, particularly from the United States and western Europe. But some in the United States – including Republican Donald Trump, the former American president and current 2024 candidate – have questioned whether Washington should continue to supply Ukraine with billions of dollars in military aid. Trump’s likely Republican rival, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, also suggested that defending Ukraine in a ‘territorial dispute’ with Russia was not a significant US national security priority. He later walked that statement back after facing criticism from other corners of the GOP. Zelenskiy didn’t mention the names of Trump or any other Republican politicians – figures he might have to deal with if they prevailed in 2024 elections. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan bringing you the latest. Our top story this morning: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says that he he worries the war could be impacted by shifting political forces in Washington. In an interview with AP, published a short while ago, Zelenskiy said: “The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win”. And Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. We’ll have more on these stories shortly. In the meantime, here are the key recent developments. The United States has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Ukraine’s frontline city of Avdiivka “is being wiped off the face of the Earth” amid intensifying Russian shelling, according to its top local official. Russian forces have been making recent gradual gains on the flanks of Avdiivka, and the Ukrainian military said last week that the city could become a “second Bakhmut”. Russia’s 10th tank regiment has borne the brunt of the assault of Avdiivka and has likely lost a “large portion of its tanks” while attempting to surround the town from the south, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. Ukraine is aiming to exhaust and inflict heavy losses on Russian forces trying to capture the small eastern city of Bakhmut, the commander of Ukrainian ground forces has said. In a video showing him addressing soldiers in what appeared to be a large industrial warehouse, Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was continuing to focus on the Bakhmut area after months of battle. Germany’s much-awaited shipment of 18 Leopard 2 battle tanks has arrived in Ukraine, the German defence ministry has confirmed. Berlin first promised 14 but increased that to 18 as part of a deal under which several EU states would contribute to a shipment of two Leopard 2 battalions and 31 American-made M1A2 Abrams tanks from the US. The first British Challenger 2 main battle tanks have also arrived in Ukraine and will soon begin combat missions, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said. The UK said in January it would send 14 of the tanks to Ukraine. Reznikov wrote on Twitter that the tanks had “recently arrived in our country” and posted a video that showed him sitting in one of a long line of tanks in an open field, all of them flying Ukraine’s yellow and blue flag. The US supports the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine, officials have said. The US ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, Beth Van Schaak said the court might also be located elsewhere in Europe, at least at first, in order “to reinforce Ukraine’s desired European orientation”. A Russian man who was investigated by police after his 12-year-old daughter drew a picture depicting Russian bombing a family in Ukraine has been sentenced to two years in a penal colony, according to a rights group. Alexei Moskalyov has been separated from his daughter Maria since he was placed under house arrest, and she was taken into a state-run shelter last month. Court officials said on Tuesday that the 54-year-old had fled house arrest and his whereabouts were unknown. The International Olympic Committee has recommended that Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in international sporting events under a neutral flag. A decision regarding next year’s Olympics in Paris and the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in 2026 would be taken “at the appropriate time”, it said. Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said the committee’s decision was “a slap in the face for all Ukrainian athletes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T22:15:29Z","webTitle":"Call to end forced installation of UK prepayment meters after millions suffer without power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/11/call-to-end-forced-installation-of-uk-prepayment-meters-after-millions-suffer-without-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers are being urged to stop the forced installation of prepayment meters after revelations that 3.2 million people – the equivalent of one person every 10 seconds – were left with cold and dark homes last year as they ran out of credit. As energy prices surged this winter, suppliers have stepped up the use of court warrants to force their way into homes to install prepayment meters, with some magistrates approving hundreds of applications at a time. For homes with smart meters, the change can be made remotely without even needing a warrant. An estimated 600,000 people were forced to make the switch away from credit meters after racking up debt with their energy supplier in 2022, compared with 380,000 in 2021, according to a major report by Citizens Advice, which is calling for an immediate ban on the use of court warrants. The charity fears a further 160,000 people could be switched by the end of winter if no further action is taken. “There must be a total ban on energy companies forcing those already at breaking point on to prepayment meters,” said Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice. “If the energy regulator doesn’t act, the government must intervene.” Campaigners are warning of “disconnection by the back door”, with suppliers protecting their bottom line as consumers faced with cost of living rises struggle to top up and are cut off from heating and power. Prepay meters charge for energy at a higher rate than contracts where the customer pays monthly or by direct debit, and people in debt are often left with no choice but to “self-disconnect”. For many, running out of credit is not a one-off event. More than 2 million people are being disconnected at least once a month, according to the report. A fifth of those on prepay report going without heat or light for at least 24 hours, unable to cook or wash. Citizens Advice said more people sought its help because they couldn’t top up in 2022 than in the previous 10 years combined. The charity has gathered a series of anonymised accounts from Britons battling to keep the lights on, including: Rhiannon, a single parent with a baby who suffers from depression, fell behind on her payments after she separated with her partner. Her landlord allowed her supplier access to fit a prepayment meter. She has resorted to warming baby milk at her GP’s surgery and staying warm in her dad’s car. Rona uses a wheelchair and lives with her daughter who has special educational needs. She is reliant on family to go to the Post Office to top up and was left without heating, lighting or means to make food over Christmas. Alice, a woman with a lung condition who was moved on to a prepayment meter due to debt and couldn’t afford to top up. Her supplier told her she could not be helped again because she had been helped before, but being cut off prevents her charging her breathing machine. Andy, a diabetic who was moved on to a prepayment meter and left without power for a week despite needing to keep his insulin in the fridge. Under the terms of their licence, suppliers are not allowed to move customers on to a prepayment meter if they have an illness or disability which means they would be harmed if their gas or electricity was cut off. Suppliers have also signed up to a commitment to avoid cutting off anyone who is on a pension, disabled, chronically sick or has children over winter. However, there are holes in the safety net. Disabled and vulnerable people already on prepay have been left without energy supplies, risking “physical and emotional harm”. The charity said that over 130,000 homes inhabited by a disabled person or someone with a long-term health condition are being disconnected from their energy supply at least once a week as they cannot afford to top up. The numbers are estimates based on data from the energy regulator, Ofgem, and a representative poll of more than 4,000 adults in December commissioned by the charity. Using an average household size of 2.4 people, researchers estimated 3.2 million individuals across Great Britain live in households that ran out of credit at least once last year. Energy suppliers typically ask customers to move on to a pay-as-you-go prepayment meter if they fall significantly behind on their monthly bills. Where the change cannot be made remotely via smart meter, suppliers or the debt collection agencies acting for them obtain court warrants to enter homes. Data obtained from the Ministry of Justice through a freedom of information request has revealed hundreds of warrants of entry are being signed off in minutes in huge batches at magistrates courts around the country. Citizens Advice said its data showed suppliers were “forcibly installing meters where it isn’t appropriate”. The charity wants a review of all users of prepayment meters with a commitment to replace them with standard credit meters, where customers use the energy first and pay later, to remove the risk of disconnection. MPs have also called for a ban on forced installations. The Scottish National party MP Anne McLaughlin sponsored a private member’s bill that requires companies to allow a grace period before disconnecting customers with prepayment meters who have run out of credit, granting them extended emergency credit for six months. She labelled energy suppliers “morally repugnant”. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, told the Guardian: “It is evident there is an escalation of people being forced on to prepayment meters where they’re paying more for their energy. If they’re unable to pay, they’re simply self-rationing. “I’m calling on government to get a grip on the situation to enable people to remain on energy contracts with support, and prepay meters need serious redress, if not being ruled out completely, as an option for people in fuel poverty.” Maskell said she had raised the issue with justice minister Mike Freer. Over the Christmas period, Ovo – one of the largest UK energy suppliers – paused the forced installation of prepayment meters. Supporters of the use of prepayment meters note that they allow households to keep a close track of their spending and can prevent much larger debts mounting up. The Citizens Advice study showed that 37% of prepayment customers with a disability or health condition had cut back on food spending to keep the lights on, while 14% used a food bank to maintain supplies. A Government spokesperson said: “The Government expects energy suppliers to do all they can to help customers who are struggling to pay their bills and suppliers can only install prepayment meters without consent to recover debt as a last resort. “The regulator Ofgem requires energy suppliers to offer solutions for customers in, or at risk of, debt or disconnection. This includes offering emergency credit to all pre-payment meter customers and additional support credit to customers in vulnerable circumstances.” If you’ve been affected by the issues in this article, you can get in touch with us here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-09T09:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘I look for the good in all situations’: The Power’s Toheeb Jimoh","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/apr/09/toheeb-jimoh-i-look-for-the-good-in-situations-the-power-ted-lasso","fields":{"bodyText":"If early Lockdown One was dominated, in televisual terms, by Netflix’s weird and amoral documentary Tiger King, then the middle phase belonged to Ted Lasso. When its first episode dropped on Apple TV+ in August 2020, the premise felt familiar and unchallenging. It was a comedy – even sillier, a sports comedy – about an American coach played by the always-likable Jason Sudeikis, who is parachuted in to save a struggling English Premier League football team, AFC Richmond. Cue lots of fish-out-of-water gags, soccer-football misunderstandings and a narrative arc that ultimately sees the perennial underdogs bite back. Ted Lasso was all that, but it emerged that it was a lot more, too. Much like Lasso himself, the show won over doubters with waves of relentless positivity and an underlying message that kindness prevails. “It tricks you with the whole sports comedy part of it, right?” says Toheeb Jimoh, who plays AFC Richmond linchpin Sam Obisanya. “It becomes a way to Trojan horse these really interesting characters and truths about us through the guise of, ‘Oh, it’s just this zany comedy about football and Americans and British people.’ And you can’t look past the fact that we were all locked at home, no one could see their parents or hug each other. It came at a really important time for…” he stops and laughs: “the world! But we couldn’t have known that when we were making it. There was just some universe magic dust sprinkled over it.” Sam, like the show, has also shown unexpected depth. In the first season, he was reserved and insular: a young Nigerian kid in England struggling to find his way on the pitch or off it. But in the second he blossomed, becoming an integral part of Richmond’s success on the pitch, and starting an unlikely but heartwarming relationship with the team’s steely owner Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham). In one episode, he leads a player revolt against Dubai Air, Richmond’s main sponsor, because it is owned by a company that refused to clear up an oil spill in Nigeria. Although he was pretty well unknown when he was cast in Ted Lasso, it quickly became clear to everyone on set that Jimoh was a special talent, according to his co-star Brett Goldstein, who plays the team’s Roy Keane-esque enforcer, Roy Kent. “Working with Toheeb is like what it must have been like working with George Clooney on ER,” Goldstein said last year. “It’s like, you’re doing a good job, but you’re not George Clooney. This guy’s going to be Batman.” Jimoh, a 25-year-old who grew up mostly in Brixton, south London, shakes his head when he re-hears the compliment. He’s not been cast as Batman (yet), but he excelled in the 2020 BBC film Anthony, about a black teenager murdered in a racist attack in 2005, and he is about to star in a new Amazon Prime series, The Power, a supernatural thriller based on Naomi Alderman’s bestselling novel. He pulls out his phone, which has a screensaver of him and Goldstein mugging for a selfie. “Brett needs to stop saying that, because he’s clearly the George Clooney of our show,” says Jimoh. “I’m obsessed with that man. He could be a dickhead, because he’s won two Emmys now, but he’s just the sweetest, kindest guy.” To be fair, Jimoh, who was nominated for an Emmy last year for his performance in the show himself, is very much not a dickhead either: attentive, polite, quick with a disarming smile. He puts at least some of this down to working on Ted Lasso, now in its third season. “Especially in this season, you can see little Teds in all the players and even the management group,” says Jimoh; the effect is compounded by the fact that on the morning we meet, off-duty, he’s wearing a quilted AFC Richmond Barbour jacket, given to the cast during the first season. “The Lasso way is there. Everybody’s taken it. And if I’m ever out and somebody stops me, I can’t not be Sam. They kind of require me to smile and be happy.” So, that’s not what Jimoh is really like then? “No, no, I’m miserable,” he replies, with a stern face. “I’m a miserable, horrible guy.” But he can’t keep it up and starts sniggering. “A lot of the story is that you can be the cynical version of yourself, or you can stay open and look for the good in situations. And I’ve tried to take that on in my life and in my career.” Jimoh has a broad grin now. “I can’t talk about the show without smiling.” Part of the reason that Jimoh has taken to Sam Obisanya, he thinks, is that Sam’s experience mirrors his own. Jimoh was born in the UK, but his parents returned to Nigeria with him when he was one and stayed for six years. That’s when they moved back, this time to Brixton, to a “two-up, two-down” where they still live today. And that was Jimoh’s home too until recently, when he moved into a flat nearby with his brother and cousin. “We don’t have a couch or a dining table,” he says. “Literally, we’re just sat on counter stools and beds, and there’s a TV. That’s it. But really enjoying it… just having to deal with adult stuff. If I don’t do something, it doesn’t get done. Yeah, being an adult sucks.” As the attention has blown up with Ted Lasso, Jimoh credits his family with keeping him grounded, especially his dad: “I could have won 15 Oscars, 17 Baftas, a Grammy and a Golden Globe, and my dad would have just been, ‘Yep, it’s good.’” Jimoh’s older brother, who works in IT, is his main wingman when he is invited to sit in the front rows of fashion shows or go to parties in the Hollywood Hills. “We went to Egypt for a Dior show and I took my brother with me,” recalls Jimoh. “He’s got long hair, plaits, but he took his hair out and had a big afro. And I ran into Naomi Campbell and she thought he was one of the models, I think because he just had a similar look to the rest of them. And she was like, ‘Oh, I wish I could have done a walk in front of the pyramids in Egypt for one of my first shows.’ And I cottoned on and was like, ‘Nah, he’s a computer guy!’ So I fumbled the bag for him with Naomi Campbell.” Jimoh did bits and pieces of acting growing up, but making a career from it seemed like a long shot. He concentrated more on his studies, and was head boy of his secondary, the Norwood School – until he was stripped of the position. “I got caught selling sweets in the playground,” he says. “It was that time when Jamie Oliver was like, ‘You guys can’t have sweets,’ because of sugar and obesity and all that. And the kids, they all wanted sweets. I went to the head teacher and she said: ‘We’re legally not allowed to do that.’ So I just started slinging sweets, bro! Also I needed to pay my way through drama school auditions.” The scandal didn’t hold Jimoh back, and he won a place at the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama in London. It was only when he arrived there that he realised how ridiculous his odds had been. “You know, 3,000, 4,000 kids apply to drama school for 26 places,” he says. “And I was dumb enough to think that I could be one of them.” Also, to put it bluntly, Jimoh’s ethnicity didn’t help him. “If you’re talking dark-skinned black boys, I was the only one in my year,” he goes on. “It’s changing now, but back then you would notice a trend of ‘OK, there’s one dark-skinned black kid, there’s one light-skinned girl or one light-skinned boy in a class.’ If I got into a drama school, somebody who looked exactly like me probably wouldn’t get into that same drama school because there’s already one of me.” That Jimoh has gone on to have so much success so quickly, is, he reasons modestly, down to some lucky breaks. “It’s moments like this where you go, ‘This isn’t entirely me, I’m not responsible for this,’” he says. “I’m just being put in great positions and I’m a hard worker and it just clicks. Yeah, I don’t have an answer for that.” The Power, a nine-part series that starts this month, is set to be another big ticket. The show documents a world, not dissimilar to our own, in which women are suddenly able to release electrical jolts from their fingertips. It starts with a handful of teenage girls, but “the power” spreads and soon women become the dominant gender. Jimoh plays Tunde, a Nigerian video journalist, whose reports spread word of the phenomenon. Tunde is the main male protagonist in the show, in a cast that also includes Toni Collette and Moana’s Auli’i Cravalho. The Power was also female-led off-screen, with an all-women writers’ room and female directors. “Especially after Ted Lasso, it was nice to not be surrounded by smelly boys,” says Jimoh. “That show was the most testosterone-fuelled environment. If you want to grow a Y chromosome, come to our rehearsal room. It’s almost the opposite on The Power.” There’s no word yet if there will be a second season of The Power, but don’t be surprised if there is: the first series covers less than half of Alderman’s book. Ted Lasso’s future is less certain: when it launched Sudeikis was adamant that it would be three series and out. Whether that has changed, Jimoh isn’t telling. “Shooting this season, it feels like there’s a closing of sorts,” he says. “Whether that’s closing of chapter one, or whether that’s the closing of the book of Ted Lasso, I don’t know. That’s up to them. But there are avenues, if we wanted to carry on.” For Jimoh, meanwhile, America beckons. “It does seem like my career is drawing me towards there,” he says. But he has other ambitions, closer to home. This summer he will be Romeo in the Almeida Theatre’s hyped production of Romeo and Juliet and ever since drama school he’s been writing a play, loosely autobiographical, called Chameleon Boy. It tells the story of a young man with African roots and the code-switching he has had to effect to find a place in modern Britain. “I’m finding now, as I grow, just where I fit in all of this,” says Jimoh. “But I will say that being a black Brit, a Londoner, a Nigerian – all that stuff doesn’t feel like separate things to me any more. They feel like they’re all merging into this one culture that I share with Dave or Stormzy or Marcus Rashford. We’re all finding this thing where we’re not in-between things. We’re here.” The Power is streaming now on Amazon Prime Stylist Vivian Nwonka; assistant Scott Hobson-Jones; groomer Courtney-Reece Scott using AJ Crimson, Kiehl’s, Fenty Beauty and Mac"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/12/israel-warns-over-iran-uranium-capability-with-nuclear-talks-at-halt","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T17:05:00Z","webTitle":"Israel warns over Iran uranium capability with nuclear talks at halt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/israel-warns-over-iran-uranium-capability-with-nuclear-talks-at-halt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/12/israel-warns-over-iran-uranium-capability-with-nuclear-talks-at-halt","fields":{"bodyText":"Tensions around a breakdown in talks between Iran and the US over Tehran’s nuclear programme escalated on Monday when Israel’s defence minister, Benny Gantz, claimed that Iran would be able to produce enough enriched uranium to make three nuclear warheads within a few weeks. Gantz also revealed a map detailing 10 facilities in Syria allegedly being used to arm Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah. He said the facilities represented a threat to Israel’s security. Iran for its part claimed it had manufactured a stealth drone that could hit major Israeli cities. At the same time, the UN nuclear inspectorate chief, Rafael Grossi, said it would be extremely hard to restore the knowledge his organisation had lost about Iranian nuclear activities owing to his inspectors and cameras being barred from key sites by Iran. He was speaking at the opening of a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, at which he argued Iran was not cooperating with its inquiry into traces of nuclear particles found at three sites prior to 2013, a discovery that suggests Iran may at one point have run a covert nuclear programme. Iran has demanded that the IAEA inquiry be formally halted as part of any agreement to revive the nuclear deal that was signed in 2015 and from which the US withdrew in 2018. Talks on the agreement have ground to a halt. France, Germany and the UK issued a statement over the weekend saying they could offer no more concessions in the revival talks, adding: “Iran’s latest demand raises serious doubts as to Iran’s intentions and commitment to a successful outcome on the talks.” But the three are unlikely to table a fresh censure resolution this week, after the previous IAEA board meeting in June voted to condemn Iran’s lack of cooperation. Iran wants the inquiry formally dropped on the grounds that it is politically inspired by Israel to rake up old issues. But Grossi countered: “This is very straightforward. We found traces of uranium in places that were never declared, that were never supposed to have any nuclear activity, and we are asking questions. Explain to me why this is a political activity.” It is thought the US would prefer to keep a lid on the Iran issue before the midterm elections in November, but one of the most informed thinktanks on the nuclear deal, the International Crisis Group, said in a new report that the situation could spiral out of control. It said there was little space left for Iran to escalate without it being able to make weapons-grade fissile material in days. The US has been steadily increasing sanctions against Iran while Tehran has, according to the IAEA, increased its nuclear stockpile and use of advanced centrifuges. The Crisis Group suggested the two sides should, in an effort to buy time, discuss the possibility of single-measure commitments, such as a deal on the humanitarian release of dual-national detainees, while respecting each other’s red lines to avert nuclear and regional escalation. The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, is due to travel to New York next week for the UN general assembly, if the US grants him a visa."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T14:04:00Z","webTitle":"Risk of UK winter power cuts fades amid fall in wholesale gas prices","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/03/european-gas-prices-warm-january-weather-uk-heating","fields":{"bodyText":"The likelihood of power cuts in Britain this winter has diminished “significantly” after a sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas. A spell of mild weather in the UK and Europe sent prices tumbling in a respite from the highs that led to soaring energy bills. European prices for delivery in February fell by 4.3% to €73.7 a megawatt hour while UK prices fell by 3.8% to 179p a therm. Recent warmer weather has reduced demand for heating in the UK and the rest of Europe and conditions are expected to remain mild for the next two weeks. The situation has boosted optimism over gas supplies, which have been stretched since Russia reduced gas exports to Europe after its invasion of Ukraine. Last week, prices fell to their lowest levels since before the start of the war in February 2022. European nations had rushed to fill up gas storage facilities amid fears of shortages this winter. They have made good progress, creating optimism among traders and leading to prices easing. Traders also bet that a potential global recession would cut energy demand this year. National Grid warned in October there was an outside possibility of three-hour rolling power cuts if cold weather combined with shortages, caused, for example, by a reduction in the gas supply from Russia. In December, a sudden blast of cold weather combined with low wind speeds to put a strain on Britain’s power systems and led to record power prices. Imported electricity from France and increased output from gas-fired power plants helped plug the gap left by renewables, averting a potential shortage of energy. National Grid has not had to use several of the emergency measures it had put on standby to avert power cuts this winter. Tom Marzec-Manser, the head of gas analytics at energy consultancy ICIS, said: “The risk of another cold snap and gas supplies not meeting demand this winter is now very low. We have done it once as a pan-European group of nations and proved we can withstand one of the coldest Decembers. “We are now that much closer to the end of the winter. The risk of there not being enough gas around this winter has reduced significantly.” Investec oil and gas analyst Nathan Piper said: “I do not think that we are likely to see power cuts come to pass. The situation with gas storage has improved, and we’ve seen electricity imports from France and Norway recently, so the likelihood of those extreme scenarios have eased a bit. However, gas price prices still remain far higher than in the past.” Concerns remain over how Europe will replace Russian gas imports in the coming year, meaning prices are likely to remain high against historical averages. Prices peaked at about 550p a therm in August, far higher than the 50p a therm 10-year average. Over the Christmas period, the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, indicated that Moscow was prepared to resume gas supplies to Europe through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which runs across Poland and was shut off last year. If this week’s fall in gas prices gathers pace, it could significantly cut the cost of the UK government’s efforts to cut energy bills. The state is covering the gap between wholesale prices and the energy price cap for suppliers, in an effort to limit typical household bills to about £2,500. The government said in November that it expected its scheme to cut domestic bills to cost £25bn this financial year and a further £13bn in 2023-24. Businesses and other energy consumers, such as schools and charities, are awaiting an update from the government on plans for an extension of a similar non-domestic initiative beyond March. Data from National Grid’s electricity system operator on Tuesday showed that more than half of the power generated in Great Britain was from wind, with gas accounting for 21% and nuclear 17%. In the run-up to Christmas gas-fired power stations made up as much as 60% of the energy mix."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/11/can-poker-machine-reform-save-dominic-perrottet-from-polls-suggesting-hell-lose-power-in-nsw","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-10T14:00:01Z","webTitle":"Can poker machine reform save Dominic Perrottet from polls suggesting he’ll lose power in NSW?

In particular, Yabsley has wondered what it says about how voters might respond. “I think it’s a roll of the dice, so to speak, because it does tread on the toes of those for whom gambling – and poker machines – specifically are a form of entertainment. But that being said, I think there is a more broad acceptance in the public now about gambling doing real harm to the community,” he said. As NSW prepares to head to the polls on 25 March, Perrottet’s commitment to cashless gaming has dominated headlines and the oxygen of the nascent campaign. It has put pressure on the opposition Labor party – which has only committed to trialing the technology – and helped the premier craft an image as a leader with the conviction to take on powerful vested interests such as the clubs lobby. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Politics,” he said, when asked this week why no other government in NSW had previously been willing to pursue gambling reform. While Perrottet’s convictions seem sincere, there is also a sense that, as the leader of a party trailing in the polls, dogged by integrity scandals, and asking for a rarely granted fourth term in government, it is also smart politics. As one Labor MP told the Guardian this week: “Perrottet all of a sudden looks like the big, brave integrity politician while we’re the same old shady Labor, yet he’s the one who … [knew about the New York appointment of John] Barilaro … who helped allow a second casino in Sydney. It’s spin. Good spin, but spin.” But will it change any votes? The Coalition is in tricky territory heading into the vote. While some recent polls show Perrottet remains preferred premier, the government has trailed Labor by as much as 56% to 44% on a two-party preferred basis. If such a vote was replicated on election day, Labor would win a majority. Election analysts, though, caution that Labor’s path to victory is not simple. In order to govern in a majority, it would need to win nine seats from the Coalition in the 93-seat chamber. It’s not an impossible task, but would require a uniform swing of about 6%. As election analyst Kevin Bonham told the Guardian: “On paper it’s just a lot of seats for Labor to get a majority. And they’re polling well enough to do it at the moment but not with a lot of room to move.” As always in state elections, western Sydney will be key. Coalition seats on margins of less than 1% include East Hills and Penrith, but Labor is also hopeful in Winston Hills, Riverstone, Parramatta and even Camden (5.4%, 6.2%, 6.2% and 7.4% respectively). “That’s interesting because at recent elections the Liberals have generally held up OK in outer suburbia and are getting crunched in inner suburbia,” Bonham says. “That may not be the case in this campaign because the pokies issue cuts across that. [Perrottet’s cashless gaming card] is appealing more to the socially conscious inner-city voter and maybe it arouses a bit of opposition in more working-class areas.” Ben Raue, an election analyst who runs the Tally Room, said while he thought Labor’s prospects were “quite good”, there was also a large possibility that the vote could end in a hung parliament and a “rickety” government of either persuasion. “There’s a few tranches of seats and if Labor can only pick up that first tranche of about four seats including say East Hills, Penrith, Upper Hunter [0.6%] and Goulburn [3.1%], it’s sort of maximum chaos because both sides are a fair way from a majority and have to haggle with what looks like it will be a very large crossbench,” he said. But with the Coalition already effectively governing in minority, the question is can it do enough to keep hold of those ultra-marginal seats even after 12 years in power. As Bonham says, history certainly isn’t on its side. “It’s rare for a state government to get a fourth term, and this government has almost no room to move,” he said. Kerry Chikarovski, who led the NSW Liberal party while in opposition between 1998 and 2002, said to buck that trend, the government would have to remind voters of its record. “What they will be saying to the community is, yes we may have been here a long time but we’ve been incredibly busy in that time. The massive infrastructure build in those 12 years, the roads, rail, light rail, the schools and hospitals,” she said. Chikarovki also believed Perrottet’s leadership on the pokies issue could prove to be a potent play for the government, and said comments by the now-former ClubsNSW boss Josh Landis about the premier’s faith had helped bring it to the fore. “That made a whole lot of people who might not have been taking much notice, pay attention,” she said. “People have thoughts on what sort of leader they want and if the premier is being criticised as a man of values, a lot of people would say, ‘hold on that’s something I support’.” While the government has been busy redefining itself, Labor under Chris Minns has played a much safer game: seeking to focus on cost-of-living issues with policies such as expanded stamp duty exemptions, and promises to boost funding for health and education. While Labor has been criticised for not offering a more inspiring platform, Raue said that may not matter. “I don’t think they’re really giving people much reason to vote for them but I’m also not sure they need to in a situation where maybe you have just enough to limp over the line,” he said. “You don’t need to give people a reason ultimately if the other side annoys enough people. Minns is presenting as competent and serious, he gives an air of being up to the job.” Chikarovki too thought he’d been impressive as Labor leader, saying his “cautious” strategy had played well during an era that included the pandemic. “Whether being a small target will get him over the line I’m not sure,” she said. Yabsley drew a parallel with the 1988 election which saw the Coalition sweep to power after 12 years of Labor rule. “There are two really clear-cut analogies: one is that we had a leader emerge who was capable of breaking the drought,” he said. “There was a conga line of Liberal leaders before Nick Greiner who had just failed to cut through and I think it’s possibly similar with Chris Minns. He has had a degree of traction [and] been fairly impressive, I think, as a performer.” The other, he said, was the length of time the Coalition has been in power. “It’s just awfully hard, when you’ve been in power that long – had the scandals and the baggage and all of that – to convince people that it isn’t time for a change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-01T09:20:02Z","webTitle":"Singapore backs Aukus and says Australia could play ‘bigger role’ in regional security","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/01/singapore-backs-aukus-and-says-australia-could-play-bigger-role-in-regional-security","fields":{"bodyText":"Singapore has strongly backed the Aukus defence pact, with ministers saying they trust Australia to play a bigger role in regional security and don’t want south-east Asia to become “an arena for proxy wars”. After talks with Australian counterparts in Canberra on Monday, Singaporean ministers reaffirmed Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines would be welcome to visit once in service. Singapore, in turn, received assurances from the Albanese government that Australia would remain a reliable supplier of gas. Aukus has received a mixed response from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with Indonesia and Malaysia the most vocal in expressing concerns that the deal could add to a regional arms race. But Singapore is relatively comfortable with Australia’s multi-decade plans to acquire a fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines with help from the US and the UK. Singapore’s minister for foreign affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, said he had “absolutely no reason to doubt Australia’s commitment” to fulfilling its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. “When we say that we believe Australia is a constructive partner, it’s absolutely sincere,” he said. “So even on Aukus … insofar as it contributes constructively to regional security we’re in support of it. We are comfortable with all the three partners within Aukus because with each of them we’ve had long-term relationships and that’s why I think we’re able to work together.” Balakrishnan said Singapore wanted to ensure free access to the contested South China Sea as a right under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea “and not by permission or grace of any power”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said if relations between the US and China returned to “an even keel … that would give all of us much relief and a sense of stability”. South-east Asia must not become “an arena for proxy wars”, Balakrishnan added. Monday’s meeting brought together Australia and Singapore’s foreign affairs, defence and trade ministers. It was held a week after the defence strategic review argued the Australian defence force must project military power further from its shores. Singapore’s defence minister, Ng Eng Hen, told reporters after the meeting that he believed Australia could “play a bigger role in our region”. He said Australia was “not just an Indo-Pacifc country, but an Asian country”. “We would welcome Australia’s ships and planes to our bases and ultimately when your submarines are ready we would welcome them to call on our ports.” The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said both countries’ interests were “very aligned” on the importance of the multilateral system and rules. Wong said while they may use a different form of words, both countries agreed on the need for guardrails to manage tensions between the US and China to lower the chance of miscalculation or escalation. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, said Australia and Singapore wanted to play their parts in creating “pathways for peace” at a time of “great strategic complexity and significant strategic threat”. Marles also said the Albanese government regarded Singapore’s energy security “as profoundly important in terms of Australia’s national interest”. “We made very clear to our Singaporean counterparts that Australia will continue to be a completely reliable partner in terms of the provision of energy into the Singaporean market and that includes the provision of gas,” Marles said. Last week the Chinese foreign ministry responded to the defence review by urging countries not to “hype up the so-called China threat narrative”. But the issue is not expected to disrupt further efforts to “stabilise” the diplomatic relationship between Australia and China, its biggest trading partner."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T03:08:32Z","webTitle":"Peta condemns Rings of Power producers after horse dies on set of Lord of the Rings spin-off","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/27/peta-condemns-rings-of-power-producers-after-horse-dies-on-set-of-lord-of-the-rings-spin-off","fields":{"bodyText":"The animal rights group Peta has condemned the use of live animals on set after a horse died during the production of Amazon’s television series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. The horse had a cardiac arrest on 21 March, while the fantasy spin-off was rehearsing for its second season in the UK. “We are deeply saddened to confirm that a production horse died,” said a spokesperson for Amazon Studios on Sunday morning. “The incident took place in the morning whilst the horse was being exercised prior to rehearsals. “The trainer was not in costume, and filming had yet to commence. Both a veterinarian and a representative of the American Humane Association were present at the time. The independent necropsy has confirmed that the horse died of cardiac failure.” The horse was standing near 20 other horses when its heart stopped, sources told Deadline. More than 30 horses were reportedly on set that day. In a statement released shortly after the news broke, Peta said the show was “exploiting animals” and called for film and television productions to use CGI in place of real creatures. “It seems that living underground with the orcs is par for the course for the producers of The Rings of Power, because they have the option to use CGI, mechanical rigs and other humane methods,” said Peta’s senior vice-president Lisa Lange. “Peta is calling on the show’s creators – and all other producers – to take on a new quest without using any real horses.” All horses used in the second season of The Rings of Power were provided by the Devil’s Horsemen, a supplier of horses and stunt people in the film industry. The company has worked with big-name series including Game of Thrones and The Crown, as well as Hollywood productions such as Justice League and Transformers. The Lord of the Rings franchise has come under fire previously for its treatment of live horses. In 2012 the director Peter Jackson was criticised for the production of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Animal wranglers on set alleged that three horses, as well as other farm animals, had died during production. In a response at the time, Peta launched a petition urging filmgoers to “refuse to see movies” where animals have been harmed. Jackson later denied the claims that any animals had been mistreated, calling them “unsubstantiated”. “The production regrets that Peta has chosen to make such a serious allegation, which has distressed many of the dedicated Kiwis who worked with animals on the film,” Jackson wrote on Facebook. The Rings of Power is a prequel to The Lord of the Rings set in Middle-earth thousands of years before the events of the film series. Its first season, which was filmed in New Zealand, became a blockbuster success for Amazon. The studio claimed it was the “biggest premiere in the history of Prime Video”, drawing 25 million viewers in its first 24 hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/datablog/2023/aug/19/how-to-take-penalty-kicks-best-stats-football-soccer-data-womens-world-cup-2023","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-18T15:00:55Z","webTitle":"A good run-up and shoot down the middle: what data tells us about penalty kick strategy | Nick Evershed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/datablog/2023/aug/19/how-to-take-penalty-kicks-best-stats-football-soccer-data-womens-world-cup-2023","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/datablog/2023/aug/19/how-to-take-penalty-kicks-best-stats-football-soccer-data-womens-world-cup-2023","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s win over France in the Women’s World Cup featured the longest penalty shootout in World Cup history – 20 spot kicks were taken, six more than the record of 14 set just a week earlier when Sweden beat the USA, and eight more than the men’s tournament record of 12.

Research, based on shootouts at major competitions including the World Cup, European Championship and English domestic cups between 1970 and 2008, shows the team kicking first wins 60.5% of the time. Importance of a good run-up One of the studies with the largest sample of penalty kicks is a 2020 paper published in the International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport. The lead author, Mikael Jamil, and others compared the effectiveness of a wide range of techniques and other factors on penalty shot success across the top men’s football competitions in England, Spain, Germany and Italy. One of the most interesting findings was that effective techniques actually varied depending on the country – for example, shots down the middle of the goal were statistically associated with successful penalties in the English Premier League, but in La Liga, the bottom-left and bottom-right corners were the hotspots. A long run-up (more than six steps) preceding the kick was associated with a successful penalty in all locations. In three countries a medium run-up (two to five steps) was was also successful. Short run-ups were not. Power v placement A 2002 paper with a small sample of penalty kicks suggests, unsurprisingly, that shots with less power are more likely to be saved, shots with a lot of power are more likely to miss, and that the sweet spot is in between the two, with the authors suggesting shots at about 75% of full pace have the highest success. In Jamil’s 2020 paper, the authors categorised power and placement shots based on kicking action – those taken with the inside of the foot were considered to be placement shows, while those taken with the instep were considered to be power shots. Both types of strike were associated with successful penalties in three out of four countries. Shot position Several papers have categorised the area of the goal targeted by the penalty taker to try to determine if there is an optimal strategy. Researchers divided the goals into a grid, and coded where penalty kicks were directed, as well as if the shot was saved, missed, or scored. Here, you can see the results from a 2016 study by Carlos Almeida and co-authors, published in the International Journal of Performance Analysis in Sport: The results from Almeida’s paper, and others, confirms what many footballers (and fans) know – there is a trade-off between risk and reward when it comes to shot placement. Simply put, shots towards the upper section of the goal are much harder to save, but are more likely to miss. And, even though shots toward the upper area are harder to save, it is much more common for players to kick towards the lower area of the goal. Analysts suggest that this is because many players would prefer to have a shot be on target, with the risk of being saved, rather than miss entirely. While not the case in Almeida’s 2016 paper, other studies and statistics suggest shooting down the centre of the goal can be a good strategy – but again, it may depend on the league. A 2009 paper analysing 311 penalty kicks from various men’s professional leagues around the world found shots at the centre of the goals were less likely to be saved than shots to the side. Premier league stats from Opta Sports say shooting low left has a 77.2% success rate and low right 80%. But aiming to the centre and high has a 97.8% success rate, and there’s a success rate of 80.2% for a low shot to the centre. Jamil’s 2020 paper also looked at shot placement, and found shooting towards the middle of the goal was associated with successful penalties in the Premier League, but in other leagues shots at the bottom corners were also associated with successful shots. In part, the success (or not) of shot placement is down to … Goalkeeper behaviour Several papers also track the movement of the goalkeeper during penalties. Given the speed of penalty kicks, it’s rarely possible for a goalkeeper to wait and react to the direction of the kick. Instead, the goalkeeper makes a guess at which way the player will shoot based on body language and their knowledge of the player’s past penalties. However, one interesting stat shows up in several papers – goalkeepers almost always jump left or right, and rarely stay in the centre, even though anywhere between 20% and 30% of shots go down the middle: Various researchers suggest goalkeepers have a bias towards action – that is, they would rather be seen to be actively diving to save the ball, even if they get the direction wrong, than staying in the centre and seeing a ball go into the corners. There are however some exceptions to this, such as when Andrew “The Grey Wiggle” Redmayne correctly predicted a panenka kick – a chip shot down the centre – from Brendon Santalab in the 2019 A-League Men grand final. Unpredictability Even though some of these stats suggest that if the goalkeeper rarely stays in the centre, and shots to the centre can therefore have a decent success rate, there is an element of game theory to penalties. Goalkeepers are often briefed on, or have studied the penalty-taking habits of their opponents, and if everyone started shooting towards the centre more, goalkeepers would respond accordingly. Therefore, researchers argue one of the best strategies for a penalty taker is to be unpredictable, and for players to change their approach to spot kicks regularly."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2023/sep/01/green-hydrogen-tunisias-solar-potential-and-electric-car-troubles","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-01T15:32:41Z","webTitle":"Green hydrogen, Tunisia’s solar potential and electric car troubles | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/01/green-hydrogen-tunisias-solar-potential-and-electric-car-troubles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/sep/01/green-hydrogen-tunisias-solar-potential-and-electric-car-troubles","fields":{"bodyText":"Your editorial on “green hydrogen” (27 August) correctly asserts that low-carbon emissions in Europe should not come at the cost of environmental destruction abroad. However, it does not sufficiently consider alternative sustainable hydrogen opportunities available in Europe or elsewhere. The predictions of technology forecasters and energy developers for this exciting energy commodity seem myopic. This is because a significant contender for driving the hydrogen economy is constantly being left out of the picture: biogenic hydrogen. One particularly interesting approach is to produce hydrogen using thermochemical processes such as gasification, which produce a massive added benefit: biochar. Biochar, which acts as a soil amendment, can be used to boost the output of existing biomass systems or even to enable biomass growth from arid areas. Jakob Andersen CEO, Mash Makes, Copenhagen, Denmark • A more sensible use for Tunisian solar electricity than manufacturing hydrogen locally might be to export it via the proposed Tunisia-Sicily interconnector for which European Commission grant funding of €307m has been announced. This could displace electricity imported from mainland Italy, which could then be used to manufacture green hydrogen. Denys Bennett Welwyn, Hertfordshire • Your editorial on the sustainability of hydrogen production in Africa makes a valid point, but overlooks the fact that electric cars are a green panacea for wealthier nations and will be simply unaffordable for the rest of the world. Apart from their individual cost, electric vehicles also require huge public investment in infrastructure. There are already significant question marks over whether this is achievable at scale in the UK. If going electric is achieved in countries with developed economies, all it will do is leave the rest of the world stranded with the internal combustion engine in its current polluting form. Forcing the motor industry to devote its resources to developing electric cars has also diverted attention from investing in alternative fuels or finding more effective ways to deal with emissions. If it is to have a global impact, a greener solution to road transport needs to be one that is less resource-intensive and more affordable. We seem to be heading in the opposite direction.

On Wednesday, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, told the House of Commons that continuing serious concerns about patient safety meant that conferring statutory powers on the inquiry was the “only appropriate course of action”. Bereaved relatives, represented by Hodge, Jones and Allen (HJA), had been seeking a judicial review challenging the failure to give legal powers to the inquiry, launched in January 2021 to investigate deaths at the Essex partnership university NHS trust and its predecessors between 2000 and 2020. Its chair, Dr Geraldine Strathdee, who Barclay said would be standing down due to personal reasons, had said she could not effectively do her job without those powers. She said only 30% of named staff – those essential witnesses involved in deaths she was investigating – had agreed to attend evidence sessions. Barclay said he shared Strathdee’s concerns. “I hope today’s announcements will be of some comfort to the bereaved families who have done so much to raise awareness of the failings of mental health in Essex and elsewhere,” he said. “I want them to know that this government is committed to getting them the answers they deserve.” Melanie Leahy, whose son Matthew died at Chelmsford’s Linden Centre in 2012 and who has long campaigned for a statutory inquiry, said Barclay’s statement “marks the start of the next chapter in our mission to find out how our loved ones could be so badly failed by those who were meant to care for them. I welcome today’s long overdue government announcement, and I look forward to working with the inquiry team as they look to shape their terms of reference.” Nina Ali, a partner at HJA, said: “Pressuring the government to change track is difficult, but the families have shown it is possible. It has long been clear that a statutory public inquiry is the only way to get to the bottom of the horrific standard of care provided to patients by mental health care services in Essex.” The shadow mental health minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, welcomed the announcement but said it “beggars belief” it had taken so long. Strathdee said legal powers would allow the inquiry “to deliver a full and robust report and make recommendations that will lead to much-needed improvements”. • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

What’s going on in our prisons?, 31 October), at the turn of the century I received a ridiculous five-year prison sentence for allegedly allowing heroin into a homeless project that I ran. Local police and some vociferous local residents didn’t like my ideas about expansion of provision. Luckily I am a middle-class woman who was supported by some good people and was released after seven months. I came out with a tumour, but I have survived, so far. Prisons create internal as well as external trauma; this was added to the abuse, neglect and trauma suffered throughout their lives by the vast majority of my fellow inmates, ordinary people who had not had the benefits and support that luckier people have. In fact, I found the nastiest people in the prison to be prison officers who seemed to delight in being able to dominate and abuse their charges. The decent officers I met didn’t survive in the job. They left pretty quickly before they became infected by the deeply ingrained culture, partly caused by the awful conditions within which many of them worked. “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” remarked Lord Acton. Indeed. It’s about time the human race grew up and lived up to its much-used description: humane. Ruth Wyner Cambridge • We must not forget the elderly and those with chronic health conditions in prison. I am aware of a prisoner who was incarcerated at 87, despite the judge being aware that he had cancer and other long-term health problems. It appears that he did not receive the specialist care he needed. His condition deteriorated rapidly and after only three weeks he was admitted to hospital. He and his family spent their last hours together while he was kept under guard. He maintained his innocence throughout and, too late for him, an appeal is at last going to be heard. According to the health and social care committee’s report on prison health in 2018, the standardised mortality rate of prisoners is 50% higher than the general population. The report said: “A prison sentence, we heard strongly, is a deprivation of someone’s liberty: it is not a sentence to poorer health or poorer health and care services.” Tragically, four years later, imprisonment is all too often a death sentence. John Coffin Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex • Fundamentally our prison problems start with politicians in Whitehall taking over the administration of justice, including nationalising magistrates courts. These deal with 97% of all criminal court cases and most go no further. The magistrates courts used to be run by committees responsible to the local magistrates and local government. They were abolished by New Labour and replaced by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service, which is now responsible to the justice department. The Conservative government made huge reductions in justice department budgets and closed half of the magistrates courts in Wales and England. Prisons are desperately underfunded. Add to that the awful record of the Home Office in dealing with prisons while politicians are forever calling for more miscreants to be banged up. In 20 years as a local magistrate I saw this excessive centralisation at first hand and concluded that while the old system was not perfect, with the dead hand of the Westminster civil service and politicians there will be no real improvement. If we wish to improve our justice system we need to decentralise the police and the courts so that there is local accountability; and there must be a recognition that the cheese-paring of justice in this country is counterproductive.

Some residents expressed anger at being alerted of water safety issues several hours after the outage while others complained about finding out through social media. Officials are testing whether the outage at the facility let bacteria contaminate the local drinking water supply, and results are not immediate. Harris county, the city’s largest county, issued an alert to residents on Sunday night: “A boil water notice has been issued for the City of Houston’s Main Water System (TX1010013). Earlier today, the water pressure dropped below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s required minimum of 20 PSI [pounds per square inch] during a power outage at the East Water Purification Plant … at 10.30am.” It added: “When it is no longer necessary to boil the water, the public water system officials will notify customers that the water is safe for drinking water or human consumption purposes.” On Monday morning Texas’s environmental quality commission approved the city’s plan to sample water before removing the boil water notice. Houston’s mayor, Sylvester Turner, wrote on Twitter that the earliest the boil water notice could be lifted is on Monday night or in the early hours of Tuesday morning. School was cancelled for some students on Monday, like in the independent school districts of Houston and Aldine, as residents were advised to boil water for at least three minutes before drinking, bathing, brushing their teeth and preparing food. Other school districts in the city told students and parents that school was still in session but that bottled water would be provided. The University of Houston told its students and employees that they “are encouraged to make plans for food and water as menu options will be limited on campus”. It is not the first time the city issued such a warning. In February 2021 a winter storm that swept the state caused its electrical grid to fail, leaving water treatment plants without power and millions of people in the dark. Cities in the state have also issued boil water notices during hurricane season. After Hurricane Harvey devastated their city in 2017, Houstonians narrowly avoided a boil water notice. But other nearby south-east Texas communities suffered when their water systems shut down. Other US cities – including Flint, Michigan; Baltimore; and Jackson, Mississippi – have recently faced water safety issues that left residents without clean drinking water, calling into question the integrity of water system infrastructure in one of the wealthiest nations in the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/03/ai-danger-doomsday-chatgpt-robots-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-03T11:00:29Z","webTitle":"Robot takeover?

Just this week, more than 300 industry leaders published a letter warning AI could lead to human extinction and should be considered with the seriousness of “pandemics and nuclear war”. Terms like “AI doomsday” conjure up sci-fi imagery of a robot takeover, but what does such a scenario actually look like? The reality, experts say, could be more drawn out and less cinematic – not a nuclear bomb but a creeping deterioration of the foundational areas of society. “I don’t think the worry is of AI turning evil or AI having some kind of malevolent desire,” said Jessica Newman, director of University of California Berkeley’s Artificial Intelligence Security Initiative. “The danger is from something much more simple, which is that people may program AI to do harmful things, or we end up causing harm by integrating inherently inaccurate AI systems into more and more domains of society.” That’s not to say we shouldn’t be worried. Even if humanity-annihilating scenarios are unlikely, powerful AI has the capacity to destabilize civilizations in the form of escalating misinformation, manipulation of human users, and a huge transformation of the labor market as AI takes over jobs. Artificial intelligence technologies have been around for decades, but the speed with which language learning models like ChatGPT have entered the mainstream has intensified longstanding concerns. Meanwhile, tech companies have entered a kind of arms race, rushing to implement artificial intelligence into their products to compete with one another, creating a perfect storm, said Newman. “I am extremely worried about the path we are on,” she said. “We’re at an especially dangerous time for AI because the systems are at a place where they appear to be impressive, but are still shockingly inaccurate and have inherent vulnerabilities.” Experts interviewed by the Guardian say these are the areas they’re most concerned about. Disinformation speeds the erosion of truth In many ways, the so-called AI revolution has been under way for some time. Machine learning underpins the algorithms that shape our social media newsfeeds – technology that has been blamed for perpetuating gender bias, stoking division and fomenting political unrest. Experts warn that those unresolved issues will only intensify as artificial intelligence models take off. Worst-case scenarios could include an eroding of our shared understanding of truth and valid information, leading to more uprisings based on falsehoods – as played out in the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. Experts warn further turmoil and even wars could be sparked by the rise in mis- and disinformation. “It could be argued that the social media breakdown is our first encounter with really dumb AI – because the recommender systems are really just simple machine learning models,” said Peter Wang, CEO and co-founder of the data science platform Anaconda. “And we really utterly failed that encounter.” Wang added that those mistakes could be self-perpetuating, as language learning models are trained on misinformation that creates flawed data sets for future models. This could lead to a “model cannibalism” effect, where future models amplify and are forever biased by the output of past models. Misinformation – simple inaccuracies – and disinformation – false information maliciously spread with the intent to mislead – have both been amplified by artificial intelligence, experts say. Large language models like ChatGPT are prone to a phenomenon called “hallucinations”, in which fabricated or false information is repeated. A study from the journalism credibility watchdog NewsGuard identified dozens of “news” sites online written entirely by AI, many of which contained such inaccuracies. Such systems could be weaponized by bad actors to purposely spread misinformation at a large scale, said Gordon Crovitz and Steven Brill, co-CEOs of NewsGuard. This is particularly concerning in high-stakes news events, as we have already seen with intentional manipulation of information in the Russia-Ukraine war. “You have malign actors who can generate false narratives and then use the system as a force multiplier to disseminate that at scale,” Crovitz said. “There are people who say the dangers of AI are being overstated, but in the world of news information it is having a staggering impact.” Recent examples have ranged from the more benign, like the viral AI-generated image of the Pope wearing a “swagged-out jacket”, to fakes with potentially more dire consequences, like an AI-generated video of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announcing a surrender in April 2022. “Misinformation is the individual [AI] harm that has the most potential and highest risk in terms of larger-scale potential harms,” said Rebecca Finlay, of the Partnership on AI. “The question emerging is: how do we create an ecosystem where we are able to understand what is true? How do we authenticate what we see online?” ‘Like a friend, not a tool’: malicious use and manipulation of users While most experts say misinformation has been the most immediate and widespread concern, there is debate over the extent to which the technology could negatively influence its users’ thoughts or behavior. Those concerns are already playing out in tragic ways, after a man in Belgium died by suicide after a chatbot allegedly encouraged him to kill himself. Other alarming incidents have been reported – including a chatbot telling one user to leave his partner, and another reportedly telling users with eating disorders to lose weight. Chatbots are, by design, likely to engender more trust because they speak to their users in a conversational manner, said Newman. “Large language models are particularly capable of persuading or manipulating people to slightly change their beliefs or behaviors,” she said. “We need to look at the cognitive impact that has on a world that’s already so polarized and isolated, where loneliness and mental health are massive issues.” The fear, then, is not that AI chatbots will gain sentience and overtake their users, but that their programmed language can manipulate people into causing harms they may not have otherwise. This is particularly concerning with language systems that work on an advertising profit model, said Newman, as they seek to manipulate user behavior and keep them using the platform as long as possible. “There are a lot of cases where a user caused harm not because they wanted to, but because it was an unintentional consequence of the system failing to follow safety protocols,” she said. Newman added that the human-like nature of chatbots makes users particularly susceptible to manipulation. “If you’re talking to something that’s using first-person pronouns, and talking about its own feeling and background, even though it is not real, it still is more likely to elicit a kind of human response that makes people more susceptible to wanting to believe it,” she said. “It makes people want to trust it and treat it more like a friend than a tool.” The impending labor crisis: ‘There’s no framework for how to survive’ A longstanding concern is that digital automation will take huge numbers of human jobs. Research varies, with some studies concluding AI could replace the equivalent of 85m jobs worldwide by 2025 and more than 300m in the long term. The industries affected by AI are wide-ranging, from screenwriters to data scientists. AI was able to pass the bar exam with similar scores to actual lawyers and answer health questions better than actual doctors. Experts are sounding the alarm about mass job loss and accompanying political instability that could take place with the unabated rise of artificial intelligence. Wang warns that mass layoffs lie in the very near future, with a “number of jobs at risk” and little plan for how to handle the fallout. “There’s no framework in America about how to survive when you don’t have a job,” he said. “This will lead to a lot of disruption and a lot of political unrest. For me, that is the most concrete and realistic unintended consequence that emerges from this.” What next? Despite growing concerns about the negative impact of technology and social media, very little has been done in the US to regulate it. Experts fear that artificial intelligence will be no different. “One of the reasons many of us do have concerns about the rollout of AI is because over the last 40 years as a society we’ve basically given up on actually regulating technology,” Wang said. Still, positive efforts have been made by legislators in recent months, with Congress calling the Open AI CEO, Sam Altman, to testify about safeguards that should be implemented. Finlay said she was “heartened” by such moves but said more needed to be done to create shared protocols on AI technology and its release. “Just as hard as it is to predict doomsday scenarios, it is hard to predict the capacity for legislative and regulatory responses,” she said. “We need real scrutiny for this level of technology.” Although the harms of AI are top of mind for most people in the artificial intelligence industry, not all experts in the space are “doomsdayers”. Many are excited about potential applications for the technology. “I actually think that this generation of AI technology we’ve just stumbled into could really unlock a great deal of potential for humanity to thrive at a much better scale than we’ve seen over the last 100 years or 200 years,” Wang said. “I’m actually very, very optimistic about its positive impact. But at the same time I’m looking to what social media did to society and culture, and I’m extremely cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of potential downsides.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-06T14:30:16Z","webTitle":"Svengali review – absorbing gender-swap power play","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/aug/06/svengali-review-absorbing-gender-swap-power-play","fields":{"bodyText":"How do you represent male power on stage without replicating the very structures you want to challenge?

It is now packed with men – there has never been a woman on the PSC – who are loyal Xi acolytes, in what one analyst described as “maximum Xi”. They range from a friend with ties to the Xi family going back decades to more recent aides who proved their commitment as he consolidated power over the years, and the hardline ideologue who is his chief political theorist. After Mao’s death, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) tried to normalise a collective leadership that made the general secretary of the party a kind of “first among equals” on the PSC. That era is over. However, the PSC members still wield immense power and will be key in shaping and implementing Xi’s vision for China and the CCP. Below are brief introductions to these seven men. New entrants to the politburo have a star (*) by their name Politburo standing committee Xi Jinping, 69 Xi took charge of the Communist party, and so of China, in late 2012. He has used this week to cement his power, and remove all political rivals from the politburo standing committee. He has been given another five years in power, and is likely to stay on beyond that. He his positions as general secretary of the Chinese Communist party and chair of the central military commission were renewed at the party congress. His position as president of the People’s Republic of China will almost certainly be renewed at the rubberstamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, next March. * Li Qiang, 63 Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, is party secretary of Shanghai, which has historically been a training ground for top national leaders. He is expected to be the next premier when Li Keqiang – now out of the standing committee and headed for retirement – steps down from the premiership in March. Li presided over the disastrous Shanghai Covid lockdown at the start of this year, doubling down on the “zero Covid” approach favoured by Xi despite a heavy economic and human cost. His elevation has widely been taken as a sign that Xi values loyalty, and familiar faces, over competence. From 2004 to 2007, when Xi was Zhejiang province’s top party boss, Li was his chief of staff. After Xi became China’s top leader, he promoted Li first to governor of Zhejiang and then party secretary of Jiangsu province, providing him with the regional governing experience and credentials he needed for bigger roles. Zhao Leji, 65 Zhao Leji has his roots in two impoverished western provinces – Shaanxi, his ancestral home, and Qinghai, where in 2000 he became the youngest provincial governor in the country. He has been head of the party’s top anti-corruption watchdog, the central commission for discipline inspection, a key instrument in Xi’s strengthening CCP and personal control. He also headed the party’s powerful Organisation Department, overseeing the appointment of all senior officials across China. He used that post to show his loyalty, placing Xi’s allies into important positions across the country during the past decade. Wang Huning, 67 A key Xi ally, Wang is rare among senior communist cadres in having no administrative experience running a province or major city. Instead he is Xi’s political theorist, his closest adviser on ideology, propaganda and foreign policy. A former academic known for his theories on “neo-authoritarianism”, Wang advocated a strong, centralised state to counter foreign influence. Helpfully for Xi, he also believes in strong central leadership, rejecting the collective leadership introduced after Mao Zedong’s death in an effort to avoid repeating the excesses of that era. His official positions include serving as director of the central policy research office (CPRO) from 2002 to 2020. * Cai Qi, 66 Cai Qi, Beijing party secretary, was the surprise entry to the PSC. He featured on some long-lists of potential candidates, but had not been widely tipped for the top. His entry is another sign of how Xi values both loyalists and people he knew rising up through the ranks. Born in Fujian, the eastern coastal province that would shape Xi’s early career, Cai spent the start of his working life there. He moved on to nearby Zhejiang province, where Xi served as governor, before being put in charge of Beijing in 2017. He has been a prominent champion of the Zero Covid policy embraced by Xi, and successfully oversaw the 2022 winter Olympics. * Ding Xuexiang, 60 Ding Xuexiang is an old and trusted ally of China’s leader. He served as Xi’s political secretary when he was Shanghai party chief in 2007 and rose with him to become private secretary and gatekeeper when Xi took over the country. He studied mechanical engineering and began his career as a researcher at the Shanghai Research Institute of Materials, before moving into party roles full time. Ding’s behind-the-scenes roles mean he has an even lower public profile than China’s other leaders, even though the CCP is generally secretive about senior figures. He is the youngest member of the standing committee and at 60, the only one who would be eligible under the old rules to serve another term in 2027. However, Xi has already ripped up norms on retirement age, so others could potentially stay on too. * Li Xi, 66 Li Xi is a long-standing member of Xi’s inner circle. The two men have known each other, and reportedly been family friends, since the early 1980s when Li worked for a party veteran who was close to Xi’s father. He has risen steadily in the party through positions across China, in Shaanxi, Shanghai and Liaoning provinces. He originally studied Chinese language and literature, but more recently did an MBA at Tsinghua University. He is now party chief of affluent Guangdong province. There he is responsible for the development of the Greater Bay Area, Xi’s masterplan for an economic powerhouse that integrates nine Chinese cities with Hong Kong and Macau."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","type":"audio","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-09T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to power – podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/audio/2023/jan/09/the-godfather-saudi-style-inside-the-palace-coup-that-brought-mbs-to-power-podcast","fields":{"bodyText":"Read the text version here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T11:50:11Z","webTitle":"‘You have to set time aside for friendship’: the radical power of hanging out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/19/you-have-to-set-time-aside-for-friendship-the-radical-power-of-hanging-out","fields":{"bodyText":"Some of my fondest memories of friends should, by rights, be entirely forgettable. There was that time we took our books to the park and dozed. The time we sat by the sea drinking coffee, watching the waves. The time we assembled my flatpack furniture (well – I watched), ordered a pizza and watched TV. Fifteen years ago, these open-ended hangs were effortless and my social life flowed with only the lightest steer. Fast-forward to now, and – whether it’s the difference between being in my 30s versus my 20s, or 2023 versus 2013, or a pile-up of both – often the best I can manage is a quick drink after work in three weeks’ time. No one, myself included, is ever free to just hang out. “I’d love to,” I say, sincerely – but there is always a “but”. The author and academic Sheila Liming wants us to find the time – or, more precisely, to reclaim it. Her new book, Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time, is partly a paean to the pleasures of idling with others and partly a manifesto to “take back our social lives from the deadening whirl of contemporary life”. “When we’re young, it feels like social interactions just create themselves: they happen organically, we run into each other,” says Liming, at home in Vermont, when we speak over Zoom. “As we get older, they seem like something we have to put more effort into. Meetings become more structured, at times more formal – and also more of a chore.” There is a desire, she says, “for more casual interactions that don’t have a lot of ‘objectives’ associated with them, where there is nothing in particular you’re trying to get out of it”. Liming proposes a return to hanging out – “more amorphous and looser” than parties, but in a world obsessed with outputs, perhaps of greater importance. Liming defines hanging out as: “any time that you find yourself killing time in the presence of others … It can be something really informal, like sitting on your friend’s sofa and having a cup of tea.” Rather than a particular activity, Liming says, it is an approach to socialising. For her, the gold standard was modelled by a colleague who invited Liming and her partner over for lunch. When they called to say that they were 20 minutes away, their host responded with enthusiasm, saying he would get started with the food. Then he asked: who was calling, sorry? Liming’s friend was willing to make lunch for anyone with his phone number. This was several years ago, she adds. “A lot has changed.” These days it may feel like we don’t have time for lunch at all, let alone to prepare it for friends who drop by. For office workers, technology and the associated expectation of round-the-clock availability have led to lengthening working days. Rising living costs have added to the pressure, with a reported 5.2 million UK workers taking on second jobs to cope. Leisure time, shrinking since the 1970s, is increasingly precious for women in particular, with US and UK statistics showing a stark gender gap: a reflection of uneven distribution of caring and domestic responsibilities. What free time people do have, time-use surveys consistently show, is mostly spent watching television – perhaps because we find ourselves too exhausted to do anything else. The barriers to hanging out go beyond simply finding the time and the energy: increasingly, they are structural. So-called “third places” – those in which you can comfortably spend time outside your home or office – are disappearing due to factors such as public spending cuts, privatisation and gentrification. In big cities it can be a struggle to find places to just be together. This creates a vicious cycle of needing money to spend time with friends, and needing to work to make money. This comes at a cost, Liming argues. When busy schedules mean plans are made long into the future, they can’t help but be crushed under the weight of expectation. By the time it actually happens, “I’ve almost talked myself out of the opportunity to enjoy it,” she says. The quality of our company is just as important as the fact of it, Liming says. “We’ve all had those experiences when we’re around someone who doesn’t quite have the time to interact with us socially. That feeling of being squeezed in between two things – of being an obligation.” I’m flooded with uncomfortable memories of events where I’ve had one foot out the door – mentally, physically or both – because I have tried to cram too much in: “stopping by” at two parties, or accepting a dinner invitation even though I’m on deadline. Seeing my grimace, Liming laughs. “It’s OK, it’s not personal. We all do it.” It is the upshot, she says, of a culture that is continuously pushing us to wring out every bit of value from our days and to “optimise” our lives. Those pressures have filtered down to our friendships. The pandemic hasn’t helped. “It’s like those muscles that I had previously strengthened through social interactions were flabby,” Liming says. Indeed, many people report that their circles have shrunk since Covid-19 – a YouGov survey last year found that 40% of Britons aged 16 and over had lost contact with some of their friends. Meanwhile, the number of “kinless” adults – those who find themselves without immediate family members in later life – is expected to grow. Yet amid this reported epidemic of loneliness, there is increased understanding that relationships are essential to our mental and physical wellbeing. Social isolation and loneliness can lead to an elevated risk of heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in the US. Liming proposes hanging out as a balm that forges connection and meaning. The first step is is to seek to nourish our relationships – not simply to renew them as we might a TV licence. “You have to set that time aside and make sure you’re doing it justice when you get the opportunity,” she says. That may mean politely declining those invitations you would only be attending out of obligation, so as to free yourself up for the ones that matter. Liming shudders to recall how many colleagues’ and distant school friends’ baby showers she got “roped into” attending in her early 30s. Relationships that we wish to maintain need not only time but space for intimacy, growth and even potential conflict. Liming writes of a disagreement she had recently with an old friend. After three hours, they had found common ground and Liming felt as if their “relationship had grown tougher somehow”. Had either of them been less invested, it might have been tempting to simply let the relationship cool. That is the muscle built by hanging out, says Liming, extending our tolerance for discomfort and our capacity for compassion. It is also about letting go of expectation. Hanging out doesn’t always have to mean “a perfect party scenario or gathering; it can be just OK”. Liming gives the example of her best friend from childhood, who now lives on the opposite coast and has two young children. When they meet Liming goes along with her friend on errands or to appointments. “Just seeing her in her daily life is much more interesting to me than a sort of forced environment,” she says. This is how I too stay connected with faraway friends, who I see on average once every two years. Where I used to try to catch up on everybody’s lives over an evening, as though I was cramming for an exam, my preference now is to dip into a few of them. I have tagged along to my sister’s work drinks, attended friends’ family gatherings, kept them company on their commute. It allows me to picture their days and engage more fully when we are apart. When schedules do not allow for sprawling socialising, or even face-to-face,“hanging out on the internet is just what we have to do”, says Liming. Certainly, in my experience, some digital interactions can be more rewarding than others – a few of my group chats on WhatsApp are nearly as free-flowing a source of entertainment and support as being together in person. This fits Liming’s thesis that hanging out is mostly a mindset, emphasising presence over merely being present. That can extend to interacting with those whom we often see but don’t count as friends: the staff at our favourite cafe or the familiar faces at the gym. A recent large-scale study found that having a diverse “social portfolio” was predictive of happiness and higher wellbeing. There are certainly risks to striking up conversations with strangers, or even allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with friends, Liming acknowledges. But: “What’s the worst thing that’s going to happen?” In the weeks after we speak, I experiment. I spend Saturday afternoon running errands with one nearby friend, then Sunday morning on Zoom with an old faraway one. I make a point of spacing out my work calls to allow for chat. I leave for yoga 10 minutes early and say hello to the instructor before class. I don’t create any more hours in my day, but I feel the difference. My new schedule allows space for possibility: to run into a friend and not have to rush off, or to receive a last-minute invitation and reply: “I’d love to” – no buts.

Though renewable energy could meet 100% of demand by 2025 at certain times of day at current rates of progress – a trend that could be turbocharged with active support from the federal government – the prospect of an Australian nuclear power station still looms large in the public conversation. Here is what we know about the pros and cons of nuclear power in an Australian context. Why was nuclear never adopted in Australia? Australian governments have always talked about building nuclear power plants but never actually followed through. While Australia holds 31% of the world’s supply of uranium, it has always been cheaper to rely on an ocean of cheap coal, gas and oil for power. Australia’s only nuclear reactor, at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, is for scientific and medical research, and produces mostly low-level waste. Why has the idea been revived now? Nuclear power appears to solve a political dilemma. As it does not rely on fossil fuels, some who care about the climate emergency see it as the fastest way to deliver zero-carbon power. Others who rightly point out that moving away from fossil fuels will hit working-class regions hardest see the “dispatchable power” offered by nuclear reactors as the basis of a new social compact that will pay high salaries while “firming” up the grid. On Monday BHP’s vice-president of sustainability and climate, Dr Fiona Wild, called for Australia to consider nuclear due to the urgency of the threat of climate collapse. “We don’t have time to choose our favourite technologies any more, we kind of need to take an ‘all of the above’ approach because the challenge is so great and the pace at which we need to move is so fast that you want to make sure you have all those options available,” Wild said. On Tuesday the Australian newspaper’s contributing economics editor, Judith Sloan, defended the “plight of nuclear power”. “As an energy crisis affects most of the world, with soaring gas, coal and electricity prices, it is surely time for Australia to have a rational debate about nuclear power leading to a definite outcome,” Sloan said. Do the costs and benefits make sense? The idea of establishing a nuclear power industry has been periodically investigated by governments. South Australia did the homework for the rest of the nation in 2015 with a royal commission. A federal parliamentary inquiry followed up in 2019. The results were mixed. The royal commission concluded nuclear power was out of reach. The federal inquiry recommended that any such project should only go ahead if there was broad support from the public – an extremely unlikely prospect. While both reports agreed “next generation” reactors showed promise, nuclear power as a whole remained a time and money sink. As of 2019, the cost of a nuclear power plant had risen to US$1bn for 100MW of generation capacity. Construction of a commercial-scale plant would take at least 15 years. If Australia had started work on a nuclear reactor before the pandemic, it would not be in operation until about 2035. The small or “modular” reactors that are held up as the future of the industry won’t be affordable until 2050. Could they help to reduce emissions? Nuclear power is not carbon neutral. While the act of generating power itself is fairly efficient and low-emitting, the process of mining the uranium, trucking it somewhere to be refined and pouring the concrete to build the plant creates significant emissions. As uranium is a finite resource, nuclear power is also not “renewable”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Renewables, of course, share similar problems because so many other systems still rely on fossil fuels – wind turbine towers require steel, PV solar cells need resins, everything relies on diesel to transport it – but the total CO2 emissions are minute and the rapid rate of installation means there is a better shot at decarbonising these processes more quickly than with nuclear. With dirt cheap PV solar and rapid improvements being made in hydrogen and battery technology, it will only get easier. What about stabilising the grid? Critics of renewable energy sources say they do not have the capacity to respond to periods of high electricity demand with “dispatchable power” on calm, cloudy days, because they depend on the wind and sun. Nuclear, it is argued, can substitute effectively for the industrial-scale fossil fuel plants now in use that can idle up or down according to demand. The problems with renewables are real but they are becoming less of a roadblock. Plans are in train to make Australia’s power grid more decentralised with a combination of PV solar, offshore wind and onshore wind working to pick up any slack in the system when one goes offline. With the addition of battery technology to store and deliver electricity on demand, the business case for nuclear starts to look pretty thin. The challenge of renewables Thanks to the uptake of PV solar on rooftops it is costing coal and gas power plants more to keep running during periods of low demand and high supply. Operators are faced with a choice: push through or power down. In Australia, operators of ageing coal plants have so far chosen to push through but, as periods of oversupply become more frequent, the costs will make it more attractive to turn off the generator. Firing them back up again is another expensive process – one not shared by renewables, which can be turned on or off quickly. Australia is a long way from hitting peak renewable energy, and there is time to resolve the challenges associated with it long before any nuclear plant would have a chance to make it off a whiteboard. Should trends hold, breaking ground on a new nuclear plant today would mean committing to a white elephant that would be too expensive even to turn on. Any other problems? All of this is without even talking about plans to handle the decommissioning of old nuclear reactors at the end of their lifecycle or the storage of spent nuclear fuel – another expensive, time-consuming process. Australia already struggles with decommissioning and rehabilitating old mine sites, and nuclear power presents new challenges. There are few good facilities anywhere in the world with a geology or a political environment stable enough to store this material long term. During its royal commission, SA considered building its own facility to store waste but failed to get support from the public, thanks in part to the legacy of nuclear weapons testing at Maralinga. The federal government is working on a separate plan to build a storage facility for low-level and intermediate waste at Kimba in SA but the process has proved divisive. Under the proposal, this facility would not be equipped to handle spent nuclear fuel, and to scale it up would mean starting all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2022/nov/14/richard-the-second-review-omnibus-theatre-london","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T20:00:03Z","webTitle":"Richard the Second review – a pared-down study of patriarchal power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/nov/14/richard-the-second-review-omnibus-theatre-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2022/nov/14/richard-the-second-review-omnibus-theatre-london","fields":{"bodyText":"There is no sign of courtly pomp or ceremony in this reworking of Shakespeare’s history play: a wooden stick stands in for a sceptre and the crown, over which the drama’s power battles commence, is a flimsy looking thing. A medieval story about the divine right of kings, it is performed by five actors, all in casual modern dress, on a stage stripped of any opulence. Anna Coombs’s adaptation is pared down to a drama about leadership with only 10 characters (as opposed to more than 30 in Shakespeare), its focus on patriarchal power and family betrayal. This makes it intimate, intense, and almost claustrophobic. The stage is strewn with spotlights and ladders – the latter a visual metaphor for Bolingbroke’s ascent to Richard’s throne and this set (designed by Colin Falconer) exposes both the stage workings and inner machinations of power. Produced by Tangle Theatre (which amplifies African and Caribbean voices) in association with MAST Mayflower Studios, it comes with a live score of Zimbabwean songs composed and directed by John Pfumojena. Actors double up as singers and the production’s musicality is central to its power, bringing great potent surges. Most strikingly, the female characters, already marginal in the original text, are absent. Also directed by Coombs, its study is patriarchy in its purest form: male bloodlines – fathers, sons, uncles and cousins – jostling aggressively for supremacy. All the more so with only one female actor in the cast – Lebogang Fisher, who plays Aumerle, who is a more central figure here. Actors double up and make each character distinct for the main part; the ensemble is strong, although some verse is spoken over-emphatically. Raheim Menzies plays Bolingbroke with an upstanding, military air and a Coventry accent, sharply distinct from the flowery RP spoken by Daniel Rock as Richard. Although he is the king’s first cousin, it is made plain that there is a social distinction between them and one which Bolingbroke uses to rally the masses against Richard’s irresponsible rule. Rock is best in his early scenes, displaying callow haughtiness and speaking the verse with crisp clarity. Sibusiso Mamba, playing various parts, is a strong presence along with Fisher. Percussive music heightens the tension and lighting (designed by Hansjörg Schmidt) defines the mood; the spotlights create an almost spooky effect, with some brightly lit, others whispering in shadows. It looses its tautness towards the end, but is well worth watching with a central concept that makes this play’s questions about leadership freshly relevant.

Who are they? Asset managers | Brett Christophers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/25/asset-managers-investment-firms","fields":{"bodyText":"Asset managers are key figures in your life, although you may not be aware of it. These investment firms are mostly recognised for their ownership of financial assets such as stocks and bonds. But as well as owning financial assets, in recent decades they have been buying huge volumes of so-called “real assets”, which in many cases represent necessities of everyday life such as housing, schools, care homes, roads, energy systems, farmland and water-supply networks. Thus, the regular payments to asset owners that we make to stay alive and thrive – such as for shelter, electricity, water or food – increasingly end up in part or in full in the hands of asset managers. Those managers decide both how much we pay, and what condition the apartment, care home or pipes that supply our drinking water are in. Observers have noted isolated, individual examples of this phenomenon. However, the dots have not been joined. The common thread that weaves together such seemingly disparate examples as embattled Danish apartment tenants, beleaguered US care-home residents and indignant UK water rate-payers has been ownership – that is, asset-manager ownership. Today, such is the breadth and depth of this phenomenon that the lives of few people anywhere in the world are untouched by asset managers’ tentacles. And some of us, especially in the global north, are thoroughly entangled: we effectively live in an asset-manager society. Consider that just one asset manager, Australia’s Macquarie, owns infrastructure internationally on which more than 100 million people rely every single day. If their control of essential infrastructure gives asset managers direct power over the conditions and costs of our daily lives, they also enjoy a more indirect form of power. For a variety of reasons, including the growing amount of capital at their command (now in excess of $100tn), leading asset managers today possess formidable power to shape government policy, not least regarding the types of real assets that they themselves increasingly control. Whereas in the past governments leaned heavily on banks for advice on financial matters (but not only those), now it is principally asset managers that have their ear. Consider two striking examples from the US. Amid the detritus of the 2008–10 financial crisis, a key concern was housing finance. What was the Obama administration to do about the millions of mortgaged homeowners who were in negative equity and facing foreclosure? The treasury team that advised Obama hired multiple recruits from the asset manager Blackstone. The outcome? Policies that not only failed the foreclosed, but simultaneously enabled Blackstone itself to cheaply assemble a vast, profitable portfolio of rental homes, largely out of those properties that were foreclosed upon. Meanwhile, since Joe Biden became president, a more pressing concern has been climate finance. How should the US finance the infrastructure investment required for climate mitigation and adaptation? In this case the key policymaking entity has been the National Economic Council. Its director until February this year? The ex-head of “sustainable investing” at BlackRock. And the outcome? A policy based on government subsidisation of investment in clean-energy infrastructure by private-sector actors such as BlackRock itself. All this raises a crucial question. If asset managers really do possess such power over our daily lives via the infrastructure that we depend intimately upon, why have observers not been more aware of the fact? Bruce Flatt, the head of Brookfield Asset Management, one of the leading players in real-asset investment, has provided perhaps the best explanation. “What we do is behind the scenes,” he told the Financial Times. “Nobody knows we’re there.” It’s high time these firms, and their power, were brought into the light.

A Democratic state senator was proposing a law that could cut into Florida Power &amp; Light’s (FPL) profits. Landlords would be able to sell cheap rooftop solar power directly to their tenants – bypassing FPL and its monopoly on electricity. “I want you to make his life a living hell … seriously,” FPL’s CEO Eric Silagy wrote in a 2019 email to two of his vice-presidents about state Senator José Javier Rodríguez, who proposed the legislation. Within minutes, one of them forwarded the directive to the CEO of Matrix, LLC, a powerful but little-known political consulting firm that has operated behind the scenes in at least eight states. Rodríguez was ousted from office in the next election. Matrix employees spent heavily on political advertisements for a candidate with the same last name as Rodríguez, who split the vote. That candidate later admitted he was bribed to run. Hundreds of pages of internal documents – which are only coming to light now because Matrix’s founders are locked in an epic feud – detail the firm’s secret work to help power companies like FPL protect their profits and fight the transition to cleaner forms of energy. The Matrix saga illustrates the political obstacles policymakers and experts face as they attempt to cut climate pollution from the power sector, one of the biggest greenhouse gas contributors in the US. The ongoing clash between Matrix’s founder Joe Perkins, 72, and former CEO Jeff Pitts, 51, is exposing the firm’s decades of extensive influence peddling on behalf of utility clients. The issue extends to several states. Records obtained by Floodlight and the Orlando Sentinel show that Matrix consulted for FPL, as well as another Florida company, Gulf Power, and Alabama Power. Matrix affiliated groups have also worked to advance power companies’ interests in Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, and in front of the Environmental Protection Agency, public records show. In Florida, Matrix’s work touched almost every level of politics, from influencing local mayoral and county commission elections to combating attempts to reshape the state constitution. In each of those cases, Matrix was working against politicians or policies fighting to curb the climate crisis by encouraging renewable power. Matrix employees had a Jacksonville journalist spied on after he wrote critically about FPL. And in 2020, Matrix even harnessed the power of the press for itself, when its employees acquired control of The Capitolist, a Tallahassee-based political news site which it used for favorable coverage, leaked records show. “I find this to be horrifying and undemocratic,” said Gianna Trocino Bonner, former chief legislative aide for Rodríguez, after reviewing some of the leaked documents. “It’s unfortunate that our process allows for something like this to exist without accountability.” Big power companies operate as monopolies with captive customers in much of the south-east US. They are supposed to be closely regulated, but their profits and unchecked political spending makes them some of the most powerful entities in a state. Howard Crystal, an attorney for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said that US utilities are allowed monopoly power “because they are supposed to expand the public interest. “[But] now we have this incredible corruption and a reversal of that because they are using their advantage to hang on to power and undermine democracy,” he said. So far, there have been two criminal investigations into the campaign against Rodríguez and another Democratic state senate candidate, leading to charges against five people, though authorities have not accused Matrix or FPL of wrongdoing. Matrix’s principal, Perkins, says he discovered only after Pitts left the firm that he and other now-former employees had been conducting “shadow activities and operations” dating back to 2016. He is suing Pitts in Alabama for fraud and conspiracy. “For many years and without my knowledge or approval, Pitts abused his power and position to benefit himself and his cronies,” Perkins said in a statement. “Upon realizing the extent of Pitts’s shadow operations and abuses of power, we filed our lawsuit against Pitts and those few rogue employees.” Pitts, who left Matrix in December 2020 to start his own firm, Canopy Partners, did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. He is also suing Perkins, alleging defamation and extortion. A spokesperson for FPL said it stopped working with Canopy in late 2021. FPL’s CEO Silagy in a recent interview denied knowing about or participating in the scheme against Rodríguez but said that Matrix had done “good work” for his company. Records show FPL trusted Matrix operatives with millions, including giving $14m to a single Matrix-run nonprofit in 2018 alone. Silagy said the email in which he told his team to make Rodríguez’s life “a living hell” was “a poor choice of words”. Digging for dirt In Florida, FPL and Matrix demonstrated how a utility and its consultants can work in tandem to resist clean energy reforms. FPL deployed lobbyists to the capital, while Matrix hired private investigators to dig for dirt and had operatives funnel dark money and order attack ads. Few examples are clearer than the case of South Miami. When the small south Florida city’s mayor helped pass an ordinance in 2017 mandating rooftop solar panels on new construction, a network of 10 FPL-aligned operatives mobilized to ensure his ouster. The team decided an effort to repeal the ordinance would probably fail. So they opted instead for “Mayor Stoddard’s electoral defeat and changing the makeup of the board”, according to a 2018 memo from Dan Newman, a Matrix contractor who was similarly involved in the campaign against Rodríguez. Along with a private investigator, the group delved into Stoddard’s past for episodes to weaponize against him, such as a South Miami commissioner’s claim on Facebook that Stoddard had forcibly kissed her. Documents show Matrix operatives arranged for the commissioner to record a robocall in which she called Stoddard “a creep”. Pitts at the time forwarded a draft of the script to two FPL executives. Newman in his memo also took credit for a Miami Herald story about the allegation. Meanwhile, Matrix-led non-profits funded a blizzard of ads against Stoddard, accusing him of using public money for “vendettas” and placing him alongside infamous sex offenders Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein. The plan ultimately failed, and Stoddard was re-elected. He has denied the allegations. “An organization that acts like a mafia should be treated like one,” Stoddard said. In a statement, Newman acknowledged managing the campaign against Stoddard and hiring a private investigator to look into the former mayor’s personal life. He said what he found was “deeply disturbing”. FPL did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Matrix’s influence was felt on matters small and large, from Stoddard’s city of less than 12,000 to statewide fights over the Florida constitution. In 2019, when the electric utility industry was up in arms about a constitutional amendment to open up competition in Florida’s energy market, a Matrix-linked non-profit poured more than $10m into groups fighting it. Matrix also exerted political influence through the press, with its operatives acquiring control of a Tallahassee-based politics news site, The Capitolist. That gave Matrix consultants and FPL executives input on Capitolist stories. The site’s publisher, Brian Burgess, a former top spokesperson for past Florida governor Rick Scott, also suggested in emails that Matrix should lure prominent Florida journalists to a new site or buy local papers owned by media giant Gannett Company and then lay off most of the “clown reporters” to “inject content” into publications without anyone knowing who was “pulling the strings”. That proposal was forwarded to Silagy at FPL but never came to fruition. Burgess said he “never pitched nor solicited feedback from FPL executives on any story or business venture”, and FPL spokesperson Chris McGrath said acquiring a news organization would not have made sense as a business deal for FPL. *** Headquartered in Montgomery, Matrix has been described there as “the closest thing Alabama politics has to a non-governmental secret agency”. Perkins and Pitts worked together for more than 25 years, expanding the firm into a national operation with dozens of clients in myriad industries. But wherever the pair went, indictments often followed. An Alabama governor the company worked for was convicted of federal felony corruption charges. A Birmingham mayor who employed Matrix got 15 years for bribery, conspiracy and fraud. And a former regional administrator for the EPA who did business with Pitts pleaded guilty to violating state ethics law multiple times. From the beginning, Matrix showed no aversion to unsavory political tactics. In 1998, the firm distributed copies of a video in which a sex worker falsely alleged she had been sexually assaulted by a candidate for lieutenant governor. The sex worker later testified the allegations were untrue, and that she had been paid by a Birmingham businessman to make them. In 2015, Matrix distributed fliers for a suspicious charity in a predominantly Black neighborhood in North Birmingham. The fliers warned residents not to let the Environmental Protection Agency test their soil for the presence of contaminants left by a coal plant. The charity was a front established by a state representative. A local law firm and the company that owned the coal plant used the charity to pay the representative. Three people were federally convicted for their role in the ploy. Matrix was never accused of wrongdoing. One of Matrix’s oldest clients is Alabama Power, which employed Perkins’ personal consulting firm as early as 1999. In 2018, Perkins Communications received at least $1.49m from Alabama Power, a leaked contract shows. Those who provoked the utility’s ire suffered a harsh response. In 2013, Terry Dunn, a Republican electricity regulator at Alabama’s Public Service Commission made moves to hold formal hearings on how customers’ energy bills were calculated – something that hadn’t happened in three decades. Customers at the time were paying some of the highest rates for electricity in the south-east. Soon, Dunn faced attacks in the rightwing press and online, while Matrix-affiliated groups – some of which received millions from a non-profit run by a contractor for Alabama Power – filed a motion to intervene in the proceedings. Meanwhile, groups aligned with the utility falsely tied Dunn to the Obama administration’s efforts to reduce the use of coal. The tactics worked. Dunn lost his 2014 re-election campaign by a 19-point margin to Chip Beeker, a catfish farmer who is still in office. Months after he was elected, Beeker voted in favor of an energy price hike for consumers. Alabama Power still hasn’t had a rate case. “Southern Company and Alabama Power run the state of Alabama,” Dunn said. “They work off intimidating. You gotta bow down and kiss the ring.” A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the firm’s activities. Perkins called Matrix’s work for the utility “confidential”. Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School said the “whole purpose” of firms like Matrix “is to conceal that it’s the utility doing this. The utility doesn’t want to be associated with this campaign.” Things start going ‘sideways’ Matrix grew so large that by 2015 it was operating several private aircraft to whisk Pitts and Perkins to client meetings. Flight data shows Matrix’s planes made more than 130 flights to five states in 2020 alone, frequently crisscrossing the south-eastern US but also traveling as far west as New Mexico. In Perkins’ telling, he was getting ready to hand over leadership of Matrix in December 2020 when Pitts surprised him by leaving the firm, taking three employees – as well as most of Matrix’s Florida-based clients – with him to launch Canopy. At the Birmingham office where Pitts and the others had worked, Perkins said he found a backup server that “appeared to have been beaten with something”. The firm later recovered more than a million files, according to Perkins, who said they reveal years of hidden, “shadow work” in Florida. Perkins and Pitts sued each other, with Pitts claiming his former mentor had “never followed through” on handing over the company despite years of discussions. Once he left, Pitts said Perkins smeared him to clients in an attempt to extort millions. As their feud escalated, internal documents started to arrive in reporters’ email inboxes from unknown sources. Many of the documents have since been verified by additional reporting, public records or Perkins himself. Silagy, the FPL CEO, says the pair initially told him they had come to an amicable agreement about parting ways. He says he told them that he was disappointed, but there was enough work for both of them, “based on the good work they had done”. “And then apparently, somewhere along the way, Jeff and Joe got sideways,” Silagy said.

Since then, its ruthlessness has only increased. The number of political prisoners has soared to more than 13,000. The junta has resumed executions for the first time in decades. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, said last Friday that the regime was using the death penalty to crush political opposition, expressing shock that 130 people have been sentenced to death by military courts behind closed doors. Many of the 1,700 people who have stood trial have been denied access to lawyers or relatives. Not one has been acquitted. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and uprisings elsewhere have meant that the world has largely stopped paying attention to events in Myanmar, where the military is literally pursuing a scorched earth policy. It has razed villages that it accuses of supporting the opposition and has bombed hospitals, schools and even a concert. An estimated 1.3 million people are displaced and living in horrific conditions. It continues to add to the raft of convictions and prison terms for Aung San Suu Kyi. Rights groups report extrajudicial killings by soldiers and militias. The assumption at first was that the military, long expert in suppressing stirrings of dissent and democracy, would soon reassert control. Even when some protesters took up arms – and the pro-democracy national unity government backed a “defensive war” – it seemed a hopeless endeavour, given their lack of money, equipment and training. Yet the resistance has been not only remarkably protracted but – under the circumstances – surprisingly effective. Civilian militias, working alongside some of the ethnic armed groups that were already battling the state, are carrying out attacks on military bases and in previously untouchable central areas. Soldiers are said to be quitting or defecting. The junta has also relied on Russia for much of its weaponry – though it can still count on China, India and others. Each fresh abuse by the regime gives opponents reason to fight on – no one believes it will compromise. Elections are promised next year, but the power seizure resulted from the military’s repeated failure to win at the ballot box, and opponents are all locked up. The regime made a vague attempt at PR by releasing 6,000 or more prisoners last month, including a former British ambassador, Vicky Bowman. But some were detained again on the same day, and the total number of those held soon rebounded. The junta remains grotesquely self-serving, with its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, spending a reported $33m on honours to keep its friends on side – in the process awarding himself two titles, one of which comes with an elaborate gold and ruby medal. Sanctions should remain carefully targeted at those in the regime and their families. Though supporters of the democracy movement praise the UK for taking the lead internationally, they believe much more must be done. They make a strong case for cutting off the supply of aviation fuel – used by the military even when it has supposedly been destined for civil flights. The junta’s increasing brutality, however, is a sign of fear as well as further evidence of its viciousness. Some of those struggling for democracy now speak not of a coup, but an attempted coup; thanks to the resistance, they say, it has not yet succeeded. They need more support to ensure that it does not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T08:35:56Z","webTitle":"Women pushed even further from power in Xi Jinping’s China","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/22/where-are-the-women-at-the-top-of-chinese-politics","fields":{"bodyText":"Across seven decades of turmoil and change, one thing about China’s leadership has remained unchanged. It is all-male. Men led China into the famine of the Great Leap Forward, through the convulsions of the Cultural Revolution and during the economic opening of the 1980s and 90s. In Xi Jinping’s “new era” of digital authoritarianism, men remain in charge of the country. The Communist party has run China for 70 years, and in that time no woman has ever been a member of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the small group that runs the country, much less led the party or been made president or premier. Today under Xi, the CCP took a step back, also eliminating women from the next level of power too, the now 24-member Politburo. The new all-male line-up was revealed the day Xi formally extended his rule for a further five years, after the closing of the 20th Communist party congress in Beijing. Since 1997, there had always been at least one female Politburo member, and briefly two. A quota system required at least one woman in senior leadership at each level below that, contributing a small but steady stream of candidates. The Covid tsar, Sun Chunlan, was the only woman on the outgoing Politburo, and one of only three women who have made it that far as political operators in their own right – rather than as wives of powerful men or propaganda tools – in over 70 years of Communist rule. Her politburo seat was thought to be earmarked for another woman after she stepped down, with two candidates named as likely frontrunners. But in a weekend of disturbing surprises, including the manhandling of former President Hu Jintao off the stage, the CCP revealed an all-male Politburo. “Chinese women have been excluded from the centre of political power at both local and central levels,” said Hsiu-hua Shen, professor of Sociology at Taiwan’s National Tsing Hua University, before the conference closed. “Without specific affirmative actions … it is very difficult for Chinese women to be able to enter political systems and shape policies.” An uneasy relationship The party was formed during a civil war, in a highly patriarchal society and has been based on “masculine violence” and power struggles since its establishment, Shen added. The CCP has nearly 100 million members, but less than a third of the rank and file are women, and the numbers thin out, the higher up its ranks you climb. “China’s patriarchal political structure limits women’s upward mobility,” said Pan Wang, senior lecturer in Chinese and Asian studies at the University of New South Wales. “From the bottom to the top of the pyramid, women get fewer at each step of the hierarchy (from CCP members, to the party congress, central committee and the politburo). This can create biases in the nomination and selection process for leading positions in the party/state.” Chinese women are held back by a variety of factors, Pan said. They include cultural expectations that women do more in the home, a career structure that forces them to retire earlier than men, just as they might be reaching their professional peak, and education and socialisation that discourages them from political ambitions. The CCP has always had an uneasy relationship with feminists, in part because Communists claim to have liberated women themselves. Mao’s slogan “women hold up half the sky” became famous as half-tribute, half-promise to China’s women. That makes any woman still fighting for her rights potentially subversive, particularly at a time when Xi is openly distrustful of any civil organising. There have been repeated crackdowns on feminists, including arrests of women protesting against issues that do not obviously challenge the political system, such as sexual harassment. China’s #MeToo movement has made little progress. Among the ranks of assembled dignitaries at the Party congress was Zhang Gaoli, the former vice-premier whom tennis champion Peng Shuai publicly accused of sexual assault last year. Peng went missing for weeks after making her accusations on social media. She was eventually seen in public after a high-profile international campaign, organised under the hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai, but has since kept a very low profile and said her post was misunderstood, while he still commands the political stage. “The CCP is still quite traditional when it comes to women at the very top. Recent crackdowns on feminist activists have further signalled a more traditionalist and conservative line,” said Mary Gallagher, professor of democracy, democratization and human rights at the University of Michigan. Communism made it easier for women to get an education and join the workforce, but as in many other countries they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, a “double shift” that is tiring and limits career opportunities. With a falling birthrate on the brink of tipping China’s already fast-ageing population into decline, there is increasing pressure on young people to have more children. Academics and campaigners fear that may further hobble women’s hopes of getting more political power in China. “I fear that in the short term, China will follow other countries and restrict women’s access to abortion and contraception as a way to force women to have more children. Ultimately, these policies will backfire and fail, but they could increase repression and crackdowns on feminist politics,” Gallagher said. ‘One woman is OK’ Requiring a minimal role for female cadres has opened the door a crack, but as the new Politburo line-up showed, has not changed a misogynist political culture. “The party has addressed it but in a relatively vague manner, if you look at the party constitution, there is a line about promoting women party members in leadership,” said Minglu Chen, senior lecturer in the Department of Government and International Relations at the University of Sydney. “In reality this policy has often been interpreted as “one woman is OK”, so there is only one woman. This obviously shows the quota system being adopted is effective, but more needs to be done.” And for nearly 700 million women who live in China, this is not just a matter of principle. “The one thing we could safely argue, with no woman in leadership, women’s issues would be under-represented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-03T08:00:44Z","webTitle":"Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew review – the terrible price of people power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/apr/03/beastly-a-new-history-of-animals-and-us-by-keggie-carew-review-the-terrible-price-of-people-power","fields":{"bodyText":"Picture the scene. It’s 350BCE, and Aristotle – presumably looking a bit like Sir David Attenborough, except in a toga – is collecting creatures from the teeming rock pools around the Greek island of Lesbos. He’s beavering away on his scala naturae – a “natural ladder” that puts everything in the natural world in a hierarchy that has animate things such as minerals at the bottom, then plants above them, followed by animals. And of course, at the top of the ladder, tottering maniacally over everything else: humans. Beastly is Keggie Carew’s messy but heartfelt account of the environmental catastrophe unleashed by this barmily Trumpian idea of Aristotle’s that we’re somehow superior to the rest of nature. As Carew convincingly argues, the influential scala naturae “paved the philosophical way – nature was to serve us”. Over 380 or so charmingly meandering pages, Carew attempts to unpick Aristotle’s folly and fix “humanity’s big error – our interactions with the planet’s other inhabitants”. She does this in part by recounting the story of our intellectual journey – from ancient Greece to today – as philosophers, theologians and scientists first built on, then started to break away from, Aristotle’s worldview. Carew, author of the Costa book award-winning memoir Dadland (2016), does a great job of rattling through centuries of dusty theological thought and the way the likes of Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas fatefully concluded that animals don’t have souls so aren’t worthy of our care, or even our pity. As she observes, pithily: “Advocacy for kindness to fellow creatures under the Abrahamic god has never really caught on.” But over the past 20 years or so, scientific research has started to chip away at this human-centric view. In 2012, scientists from around the world signed the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness, announcing that “the weight of evidence” shows “all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses” are conscious beings – a revolutionary moment, because it proves that animals aren’t “dumb beasts” that we can use and abuse, but feel pain and other emotions. Carew, though, isn’t especially wowed by this scientific sea change: “The extraordinary thing is that it took so long. More extraordinary still, perhaps, is that it needed to be stated at all.” Alongside this potted history of our philosophical understanding of nature, Carew describes, in myriad moving ways, the colossal environmental damage caused by our wrong-headedness. From the destruction of wild habitats (only 2.9% of land on Earth is “faunally intact” – the rest tarnished or ruined) to biodiversity loss everywhere, the book is brimming with examples of irrevocable harm. “Wherever we showed up,” notes Carew, darkly, “extinctions followed.” She writes poignantly about the suffering of the beautiful baiji, the Chinese river dolphin that was gradually overwhelmed by pollution, noise and over-fishing: “The baiji took more than 20m years of evolution to refine, and 50 years of grand communist-capitalist ideology to rub out.” The book’s structure is confusing at times, jumping between Carew’s personal memories, facts about one species or another and wide-ranging summaries of human history. Then again, maybe she is trying to mimic Charles Darwin’s famous “tangled bank” metaphor for how everything in nature is connected. Indeed, Carew is especially compelling when it comes to this interrelatedness, where the dying out of one species can cause entire ecosystems to decline and fall. Sea otters, for instance, were wiped out on America’s coasts, which meant that the urchins they ate multiplied unchecked, which in turn caused entire kelp forests to fail – killing off their inhabitants, including the gentle 10-tonne Steller’s sea cow. The disappearance of one creature can spell doom on a much larger scale. As Carew warns us: “We mess with these interactions at our peril, for they’re so immensely complex we do not understand them.” In place of Aristotle’s egocentric ladder, Beastly is a clarion call for the humbler notion that every bit of nature matters: “Our banners must shout more expansively: Save the whale! Save the krill! Save the phytoplankton! Save everything in between!” Time and again, Carew comes back to the psychological impact that losing wild places is having on us – sometimes called “solastalgia”: the sadness we feel as we wander through landscapes unnaturally devoid of insects, birds and animals. For Carew, as for many of us, this melancholy has given way to something darker: “A close cousin of solastalgia is eco-furiosity, an eco-tear-your-hair-out solastalgia on steroids. It is the long loud, desperate cry of the human heart.” The only hope for our battered planet is that we come to appreciate the wondrous interconnectedness of living things. As Carew wistfully puts it: “When we understand, we begin to care.” • Beastly: A New History of Animals and Us by Keggie Carew is published by Canongate (£20).

The Australian prime minister said a war in the Indo-Pacific would be “devastating for the world” and used a keynote speech to a regional security summit in Singapore to urge all countries to uphold peace and stability. Albanese also sought to reassure countries in the region that remain wary about Australia’s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. “In boosting our nation’s defence capability, Australia’s goal is not to prepare for war but to prevent it, through deterrence and reassurance and building resilience in the region.” Albanese said it must be “crystal clear that when it comes to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force – be it in Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea or elsewhere – the risk of conflict will always far outweigh any potential reward”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, are among security officials and analysts from more than 40 countries attending the three-day Shangri-La Dialogue. Albanese is accompanied on the trip by his defence minister, Richard Marles, who is expected to meet with Li this weekend. Marles attended the same summit last year in what marked the end of China’s freeze on high-level dialogue with Australia. Albanese said it was “dangerously wrong” for anyone to describe the region as “a potential ‘theatre’ for conflict, as if this is merely a backdrop, a location, an arena for the ambitions of others”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister said no one should dismiss “the agency and ambition of a majority of the world’s population and the engine room of the global economy” or see the future of the region as a “foregone conclusion”. He drew parallels to “flawed” and “complacent” assumptions after the cold war that globalisation and free trade would create a more open, stable world. Albanese pointed to “the rise of nativism and isolationism” and “the biggest conventional military build-up since the second world war” – the latter referring to China. But he said the fate of the Indo-Pacific was “not preordained”. “To move from imagining conflict is impossible to assuming war is inevitable is just as harmful to our shared goals,” he said. Albanese sought to reassure south-east Asia that his government sees the region in positive terms, not just as a venue for geopolitical rivalry. “I can assure you that when Australia looks north, we don’t see a void for others to impose their will,” he said. “We see a community of nations whose actions and decisions are essential to building prosperity and preserving peace in the Indo-Pacific.” Albanese also said the citizens of the region had shown “an unflinching commitment” to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. He described such weapons as “destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate” and called for cooperative action to “drive disarmament”. Backing the concept of “guardrails” to manage tensions between the US and China, Albanese said Australia strongly supported the Biden administration’s push to establish “reliable and open channels of communication” with Beijing. “This isn’t about a policy of containment; it’s not a question of placing obstacles in the way of any nation’s progress or potential,” he said. “This is a matter of simple, practical structures to prevent a worst-case scenario.” He said despite a difference of “worldviews” and “values”, Australia was placing dialogue at the heart of its efforts to stabilise relations with China. “Because the alternative – the silence of the diplomatic deep freeze – only breeds suspicion, only makes it easier for nations to attribute motive to misunderstanding, to assume the worst of one another,” Albanese said. Albanese urged China to remove “impediments” to trade with Australia. The federal opposition has backed dialogue with China but has started to question whether it is leading to tangible outcomes. The shadow foreign minister, Simon Birmingham, told ABC Radio National on Friday that China was “continuing to impose punishment and coercion upon Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T14:00:00Z","webTitle":"UK homes can become virtual power plants to avoid outages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/20/uk-homes-national-grid-virtual-power-plants-outages-electricity","fields":{"bodyText":"This month we published our analysis of the British electricity system this winter. Our message is clear: in the base case our analysis indicates that supply margins are expected to be adequate, however this winter will undoubtedly be challenging. Therefore, all of us in the electricity system operator (ESO) are working round the clock to manage the system, ensure the flow of energy and do our bit to keep costs down for consumers. One of the tools we have developed is the demand flexibility service. From November, this new capability will reward homes and businesses for shifting their electricity consumption at peak times. And we are working with the government, businesses and energy providers to encourage as high a level of take-up as possible. We are confident this innovative approach can provide at least 2 gigawatts of power – about a million homes’ worth. What began as an initiative to help achieve net zero and keep costs down is also proving to be an important tool in ensuring Britain’s energy security. We are particularly keen to get businesses involved right across Britain. When the Guardian first reported on this service we had calls from businesses ranging from multinationals to an owner of a fish and chip shop asking how they could do their bit and get signed up. We can now confirm our proposals for how much people and businesses can be paid for shifting their electricity use outside peak times. We anticipate paying a rate of £3,000 per megawatt hour. Businesses and homes can become virtual power plants and, crucially, get paid like one too. For a consumer that could mean a typical household could save approximately £100, and industrial and commercial businesses with larger energy usage could save multiples of this. We are working with Ofgem to get this scheme launched in November and for it to be rolled out through energy suppliers. If you are interested in participating, or understanding what you could get paid, please contact your energy supplier. Innovations such as these have never mattered more. Vladimir Putin’s unlawful aggression means we are facing unprecedented energy market volatility and pressures on energy supplies this winter. As a result of Russia’s war in Ukraine, European gas is scarce and prices are high. Alongside this, France’s nuclear fleet has experienced a higher number of outages than expected. Energy shortages in Europe could have knock-on implications for energy supply in Britain. We have put in place additional contingency arrangements for this winter. For example, the ability to call on generators to fire-up emergency coal units, giving Britain 2GW of additional capacity. We need to be clear, it is possible that without these measures supply could be interrupted for some customers for limited periods of time. This could eventually force us to initiate a temporary rota of planned electricity outages, meaning that some customers could be without power for up to three hours at a time through a process called the electricity supply emergency code (ESEC). Under the ESEC process we would advise the public the day before any disconnections. We are working with government and industry on planning for this so that the message can be spread across all communities as quickly and accurately as possible. This would include press conferences, social media campaigns, and working with influencers in different communities. That’s the worst-case scenario, which our analysis tells us is unlikely to become a reality. Our base case is that security of supply margins will be adequate through the winter.

Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit’s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, Kyiv said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on Monday morning. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and further south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank The Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all “volunteer units” should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a photoshopped image to Telegram which shows Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. Three civilians were killed Sunday and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt at the weekend to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-14T16:05:13Z","webTitle":"Ministers’ attacks on civil servants ‘damaged Whitehall staff retention’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/aug/14/ministers-attacks-on-civil-servants-damaged-whitehall-staff-retention","fields":{"bodyText":"Ministers’ disparaging public attacks on civil servants have damaged staff retention and morale in Whitehall, the government’s ethics watchdog has said. Government officials have been accused of being “obstructive and furthering their own agenda”, according to the committee on standards in public life, which pointed to an erosion of the normal conventions that govern civil servants’ relationship with ministers. In its submission to a parliamentary inquiry on Whitehall leadership and reform, the committee – which is chaired by a former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans – said ministers should be mindful of the power imbalance as public disparagement had consequences. It also said there had also been a rise in anonymous briefings from within the civil service, with some officials opposed to the government’s “willingness to test the boundaries of legality”. “In recent times there has been an erosion of the conventions that have governed the relationship, with public criticism of civil servants becoming increasingly disparaging in tone and an increase in anonymous briefings by civil servants to the media,” the committee said in evidence to the Commons public administration committee. “During and after our review, we heard examples of low civil service morale. There will be a range of factors to explain this, but public accusations of civil servants being obstructive and furthering their own agenda is undoubtedly damaging for staff retention and is unlikely to attract the very best people to work in the public sector.” The submission outlined findings from the committee’s report on leadership in public life, published earlier this year, which said it had heard that the government’s “willingness to test the boundaries of legality in challenging policy areas” had been difficult for some civil servants who had “struggled to reconcile their work with their own personal values”. It said ministers were right to expect high standards of their officials. It had been suggested to the committee that in some cases civil servants may mistake a feeling of “dislike or discomfort” over policy choices for ethical considerations that could constitute a breach of the civil service code, the submission said. The watchdog said civil servants must serve the government of the day impartially and if they felt unable to do that they must move roles or departments or leave. The committee was set up in 1994 under John Major. It advises the prime minister on upholding standards of conduct across public life in England. Its members include Lady Arden, a former supreme court justice, Dame Margaret Beckett, the former Labour minister, Ian Blackford, the former Westminster leader of the SNP, Lady Finn, a Conservative peer and former deputy chief of staff to Boris Johnson, Ewen Fergusson, a City lawyer, and Prof Gillian Peele. Evans is nearing the end of his five-year term at the helm, telling Sky News recently that he thought there should be more transparency about the source of political donations and suggesting a ceiling on the amount MPs can earn from second jobs. The inquiry on civil service leadership and reform was opened by the Commons public administration committee after a torrid period for relations between ministers and Whitehall, with relations hitting a low last year. In February 2022, Jacob Rees-Mogg, then the Cabinet Office minister, outlined huge job cuts and left “sorry you were out” notes on the desks of civil servants working from home. Since leaving office, Rees-Mogg has claimed “idle”, “workshy and snowflakey” civil servants frustrated his efforts to scrap EU laws. In April this year, Dominic Raab quit as deputy prime minister after he was found to have acted in an intimidating way towards civil servants. He then claimed to have been the subject of a concerted campaign by unionised officials trying to undermine him. Relations have also been strained by protracted pay disputes and strikes, as well as the sacking of Tom Scholar as the Treasury’s permanent secretary by Liz Truss during her brief time as prime minister. Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, defended the civil service in July, saying criticism of officials had been “insulting and dehumanising”. He said any minister labelling the civil service with terms such as “the blob” would be engaged in “self-defeating cowardice”. Case, appointed under Boris Johnson, said relations had improved under Rishi Sunak since November but added: “The last five years or so have seen, I think, an increased number of attacks on civil servants individually and collectively by significant political figures which has undoubtedly undermined the good functioning of government.” Some quarters of Whitehall previously felt Case failed to defend them sufficiently after Raab’s attack on “unionised officials” and when some civil servants were under fire during the Partygate scandal. Earlier this year, the Institute for Government found that political turmoil had contributed to record levels of staff turnover and declining morale in the civil service. Lucille Thirlby, the assistant general secretary of the FDA union, said: “Civil servants have no right of reply to the accusations levelled at them by certain politicians, and also have no effective means of raising concerns about ministerial behaviour when the prime minister remains judge and jury on any complaints. “Our own survey of senior civil servants found over 17% had witnessed unacceptable behaviour by a minister, across 20 government departments, and nearly 70% said they did not have confidence that, if they raised a complaint, it would be dealt with fairly.” She said ministers must “heed the warning and seek to rebuild trust with civil servants, end the negative briefings, and ensure the civil service is able to recruit and retain the most talented people to deliver our vital public services.” Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the PCS union, the biggest civil service union, said: “The best way for ministers to improve the morale, efficiency and productivity of civil servants is to treat them with the respect they deserve and give them a fair pay rise to help them through the cost of living crisis and beyond.” Asked about the committee’s submission, a government spokesperson said: “There is and always should be a professional and productive relationship between ministers and civil servants. The civil service continues to work closely and collaboratively with ministers to deliver for the public on the government’s priorities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-07T14:21:41Z","webTitle":"World Cup 2022 power rankings: how the remaining eight teams shape up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/dec/07/world-cup-2022-power-rankings-how-the-remaining-eight-teams-shape-up-qatar","fields":{"bodyText":"The Seleção are in full flight and, as you may have heard, enjoying themselves in the process. Their first-half evisceration of South Korea felt like a throwback, moments such as Richarlison’s seal impression offering reminders of those days when nobody could rival Brazil for sheer fun. Even without Gabriel Jesus they retain a depth of attacking talent few can match, partly thanks to Neymar’s Lazarus-like recovery from injury. Keep this up and a first World Cup since 2002 should be theirs, although there are caveats: they squeaked past Switzerland, the only practised tournament side they have faced, and Croatia should offer an even sterner test on Friday. Alisson Becker was also worked harder than he may have liked on Monday night, although he demonstrated the value of a top-class keeper in the process. Can anyone stop them? Sometimes it feels France’s plan is to send possession Kylian Mbappé’s way and say: “You do the rest.” The problem for their opponents is that it tends to work. Anyone who can halt Mbappé may be able to stop Les Bleus but he is in virtually unplayable form and already looks a safe bet for the Golden Boot. Didier Deschamps will also be encouraged that the supporting cast is showing signs of life and France, who have scored nine goals across the three games in which he has selected a first-choice side, may be clicking at the right time. The evergreen Olivier Giroud adds a valuable balance while Aurélien Tchouaméni has taken to life as their midfield linchpin. Further injuries would give Deschamps a headache but the core look in lean shape. That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Now that Fernando Santos has, perhaps terminally, cut the cord with Cristiano Ronaldo the tournament seems alive with possibility for Portugal. They were devastating against Switzerland, a rejuvenated frontline slicing their unusually loose opponents open at will and Gonçalo Ramos coming from nowhere to become a potential star of this winter. Beating decent Ghana and Uruguay sides in the group stage was further evidence of the weapons Santos has in his armoury, which include a potent substitute in Rafael Leão. They will not be devastated at facing Morocco on Saturday, who spent 120 minutes on a highly rewarding but hugely exacting task in defeating Spain. Could Ronaldo’s much-sought World Cup be won from the sidelines? Gareth Southgate’s players will find France a clear step up from several lower-key assignments but it would not take an over-active imagination to see them pull through on Saturday. There were rocky moments early on against Senegal but England have some of the best young players in the tournament – Jude Bellingham has announced himself as an essential pick – and are a gripping proposition when on the front foot. When they are denied space, much of their possession can appear sterile: France will know that and may be content to utilise their own speed through counterattacks. But Harry Kane has opened his account, the midfield looks well-balanced and defensive bloopers have been minimised: could it be coming home for Christmas? Every Argentina match in Doha feels like appointment viewing, if not for the fare produced by Lionel Scaloni’s team then for the jaw-dropping support that turns stadiums into pulsating places of worship. La Albiceleste have only shone in flashes but have done well to banish that remarkable defeat by Saudi Arabia, and one thing is clear: Lionel Messi is already enjoying his best World Cup, scoring three times and operating on a different level to everyone else. There are signs his younger teammates are raising theirs: Julián Álvarez is showing why Manchester City brought him to the Etihad and the Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernández looks an outstanding talent. They still need to put it together against the best but with supporters that make it feel like they have home advantage, Argentina have a chance. There is a sense Louis van Gaal’s team has flown beneath the radar so far but, like others, they are stirring at a convenient point. Critics accused them of boring football during an unremarkable group stage but Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo – the latter was certainly exempt from criticism in earlier games – shone against the USA and Denzel Dumfries was outstanding at right wing-back. Frenkie de Jong was also back to his best and their tie with Argentina, a reprise of previous classics, looks finely poised. The Netherlands are unbeaten in 19 games since Van Gaal’s return and, while he would still like greater control in possession, can be rapier-like in the transition. If Messi is to land the biggest prize, he has a stiff hurdle to overcome on Friday. Morocco showed in the group stage that they are a serious team and everyone is awake to that now after they dumped Spain out. Walid Regragui oversees a tough, clever unit with extraordinary tactical discipline and an attack capable of the unexpected. The only goal they have conceded was a consolation in the win over Canada and that is some achievement given they have played Croatia, Belgium and Spain. Shutting out Portugal on Saturday would top the lot and Morocco have a chance. In Achraf Hakimi they possess a genuine star, while Luis Enrique can testify to the qualities of the midfield whirlwind, Azzedine Ounahi. And nobody can discount a flash of genius from Hakim Ziyech. Africa has never had a representative in the last four and Morocco are a win away from making history. You know the old saying: never write off the Croatians. In all seriousness, Zlatko Dalic’s team have a whiff of past Germany sides about them: they never know when they are beaten and, while they are creaking in some departments, few know their way around a tournament more adeptly. They were on the ropes against a sparky Japan but pulled through; Ivan Perisic’s equaliser was a reminder that half this squad still boasts several World Cup finalists and that counts for plenty when fine margins need navigating. Whether they can handle Brazil’s attacking tempo remains to be seen but it would be foolhardy to rule them out on Friday. One way or another, Croatia have a habit of making you play on their terms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-03T15:32:03Z","webTitle":"Whatever the truth behind allegations against Lizzo, women can certainly be abusers, too | Gaby Hinsliff","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/03/lizzo-allegations-women-abusers-power-toxic","fields":{"bodyText":"Being an icon, the rapper-singer-songwriter Lizzo once said, is not about how long you’ve had your platform. Instead it’s about “what you do with that platform”, as she told a cheering crowd at last year’s People’s Choice awards in the US, before inviting a string of female activists who she suggested were more deserving of recognition to join her on stage. Few seemingly embodied inclusive feminism better than Lizzo, who built her brand on an uplifting, joyful, thrillingly body-positive form of female empowerment while glorying in her sexuality as a self-styled “big grrrl”. Of course it’s her bouncy, summery track Pink that plays over the opening scenes of the new Barbie film. Who better than Lizzo to sell the idea of a dreamworld ruled by women for women, where men are just Kens and benign rule by Barbies frees all their sisters to be whatever they want to be? How depressing, then, that the very same Lizzo should now find herself accused – along with her production company and dance captain Shirlene Quigley – of creating the very opposite of a dreamworld for women behind closed doors. Three of her former tour dancers have filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles claiming they were “exposed to an overtly sexual atmosphere that permeated their workplace”, effectively amounting to sexual harassment. Quigley is accused of pushing her Christian views on the dancers, denigrating those who had premarital sex, and Lizzo of pressuring one of the dancers to intimately touch a nude performer in an Amsterdam club, a story that sounds as if it could have come straight from some 1990s horror story of City women forced into a leering boys’ trip to Stringfellows. The same dancer, Arianna Davis, also alleges she felt fat-shamed for her weight on a tour explicitly celebrating full-figured women. On Thursday Lizzo hit back hard at what she called “sensationalised stories” from former employees who, she alleged, behaved unprofessionally on tour, writing on her Instagram account: “Usually I choose not to respond to false allegations but these are as unbelievable as they sound and too outrageous to not be addressed.” The vitriol poured over her on social media, meanwhile, suggests some are enjoying trashing a loud, proud, joyously big black woman for all the wrong reasons. But while the truth of these particular allegations will presumably now be settled only in court, there’s a cautionary tale here about female empowerment that transcends one artist. The idea that any female boss could be as capable as a male one of making employees’ lives miserable, or even of sexual harassment, shouldn’t surprise us as much as it invariably does. Sisters are not always sisterly and nor are women somehow innately nice. (I still remember the former colleague shocked to be asked directly whether she planned to get pregnant any time soon, in a job interview conducted by a groundbreaking senior woman; I remember, too, the doughty feminist campaigner whose young female underlings seemed visibly terrified of her.) Sexual harassment by women, meanwhile, may be rare but it’s not nonexistent. At the height of #MeToo, when the Westminster whisper network started sharing stories about allegedly inappropriate behaviour by MPs, a sprinkling of female names was thrown in to an admittedly much larger pot of male ones who reportedly made junior staff feel uncomfortable. For whatever reason, those particular whispers never saw the light of day. Perhaps men worried that if they reported it they’d be ridiculed, or told they should be able to handle a clumsy sexual overture or remark from a woman half their size. But anyone can be afraid of the professional consequences of rejecting the boss. Anyone can be made to feel humiliated, or anxious about coming in to work because of what they’ll have to pretend they are comfortable with. And women, of course, can also be sexually harassed by women. Yet the possibility still rarely enters into our assumptions, even now. The current Commons women and equalities select committee inquiry into misogyny in the music industry has heard some shocking stories about life in a precarious freelance world where crew members feared they’d never work again if they complained about a big star’s behaviour. But what’s striking, reading through the evidence transcripts, is how many witnesses and MPs alike talked about tackling misogyny by hiring more female executives or signing more female artists. It is ingrained in us to see men as the problem and women as the answer, no doubt because so often that is how it pans out. But anyone can behave badly given half a chance, especially in the kind of toxic, high-pressure environments where people with power are indulged in abusing it, so long as they’re getting results. Harassment is ultimately an abuse of power, and these days power doesn’t always lie where it did. Countless women, me included, can point to female bosses who made their working lives easier. But plonking one woman on a golden pedestal fixes nothing by itself. It’s not enough for one Barbie to preside over a make-believe world of female empowerment, while in the real world the same old assumptions and commercial pressures create the conditions under which some women thrive and others mysteriously don’t. And there’s nothing particularly positive, either, about a sexuality that rides roughshod over other people’s boundaries. The only power that really counts, at work or in private life but perhaps especially in the kind of jobs that disingenuously blur the two, is the power to say no to something personally uncomfortable without having to live in fear of the consequences.

Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T03:57:19Z","webTitle":"No phone, no internet, no power, no money – it was like being sent back to the Victorian era | Caitlin Cassidy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/05/no-phone-no-internet-no-power-no-money-it-was-like-being-sent-back-to-the-victorian-era","fields":{"bodyText":"I didn’t intend to spend my Sunday hacking at gargantuan weeds with a half-broken set of pruning shears in the rain. But the universe – or, more accurately, a unique combination of bad luck and stupid decisions – had conspired against me, leaving me with no phone, no internet, no power, no money and nothing to do but tend to my overgrown garden. I am known to be a forgetful person. Among things I have lost are keys, wallets, bike locks, prized jewellery, hats (many, many hats), jackets, library books and credit cards. So it didn’t exactly bowl me down with surprise when I awoke on a Saturday morning to the realisation that at some point between a gig, an Uber ride and a late-night board game, my iPhone had gone missing. This was the fifth phone I had lost (four domestically, one at a Rastafarian bar in the northern foothills of Thailand). As such, I’ve become accustomed to periods of accidentally enforced phone withdrawals, and don’t consider myself a social media junkie. I took the temporary loss of my connection to the outside world in my stride, spending Saturday cooking with my housemate and wandering the park with my dog. I even found myself thinking with some sense of humble reverence how nice it was to “switch off” for a moment and appreciate the little things – a child playing with their mother, a community sausage sizzle, my dog bounding across an oval with his tongue lolling out. What I didn’t expect was waking up on day two without a phone to a major power outage, courtesy of an ancient house with old wiring and a bucketload of rain overnight. Suddenly, my other technological devices were rendered useless. How was I supposed to idly scroll Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on my laptop? How was I supposed to stream bad reality tv on Netflix? How was I supposed to Google random things – like the last time Carlton was in a grand final with Collingwood (1988), or the price of Gwyneth Paltrow’s vagina candle (approximately $100)? Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads As a millennial, I straddle the divide between dial-up internet and the explosion of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. I still remember getting my first mobile as a prepubescent child - a red flip-phone that I adorned with gems and used primarily to play the retro Nokia game Snake. Even in those days, technology was rife in my life, from my Nintendo DS to nights on MSN and Club Penguin (if you know, you know). Now, I had found myself in a Survivor-esque situation, or something like one of those shows where they send families back to the 1800s in Victorian-era clothing. To make matters worse, my bank card had been missing for about a week, tucked in a rarely used bag or jacket, I had assumed, and I’d been relying on my phone’s digital wallet to pay for everything in my life. And I’d allow my car to run almost completely out of petrol. So here I was, a Rapunzel locked in my tower as the contents of our fridge slowly warmed to room temperature and rain pooled into mud-piles in the yard. But I could do this! Nay, my housemates and I could do this! We set to work, sticking a candle into one of the previous night’s empty wine bottles and positioning it in the toilet so nobody would be required to poo in the dark. Gazing at the flickering wick, burning softly by toilet paper rolls, and the slow trickle of water from our semi-broken latrine, it almost looked like a highly valuable modern art installation. “The Fountain of Youth,” a housemate whispered. For the first hour, I was determined to make the most of a bad situation. I began a 1,000 piece puzzle, completed the edges and read the newspaper from front to back. I cleaned the house, emptied the bins and brushed my dog. By hour three, I had begun vacantly roaming the halls, dreaming of the adrenaline hit of a Twitter notification or an Instagram like. The world could literally have entered into nuclear war, I thought, and I wouldn’t know. By hour five, I had lost it. Distraction – I needed it desperately. My dog and the house were pristine. There was no other option. I grabbed a pair of shears and boots and hit the front yard. Sopping wet, with a slightly mad look in my eye, I hacked away, as dog-walkers walked by with umbrellas and telephones and, probably, working power-points. The universe had tested me, and I had proven it right. I went to bed. That night, with the power finally restored courtesy of a very kind electrician who mysteriously went by “Mr White”, my housemates and I sat in the kitchen and completed the puzzle together by lamplight. We barely spoke but for the slotting of a tricky piece, when we’d cry out in exultation. We were too focused. I didn’t think of my phone once."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-04T09:30:09Z","webTitle":"Anecdotal evidence has the power to change minds but facts are paramount | Torsten Bell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/dec/04/anecdotal-evidence-has-power-change-minds-facts-are-paramount","fields":{"bodyText":"Welcoming good news is easy but it’s important to face up to bad news too, either to overcome it or quickly lower your expectations of life in line with it. On the face of it, beneath an encouraging headline, there’s some crushingly bad news for those of us working on rigorous, evidence-heavy research in a recent study that investigates which information changes the minds of people on the role of international aid spending, the efficacy of which many are sceptical about. The latter point in part explains why many countries are theoretically signed up to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid but most are doing no such thing. The chancellor’s autumn statement confirmed there was no imminent prospect of the UK returning to doing so. The researchers conducted an experiment to evaluate the impact of telling people (specifically 6,000 Germans) that an aid programme worked, by measuring its effect on their belief in aid effectiveness. The good news is that this was positive, raising average support by more than 10%. But, crucially, they also examined whether that impact is greater if it is backed up by different kinds of evidence: a serious chart illustrating the results of a scientific evaluation of the programme or a simple anecdote of someone who benefited endorsing the programme. Which kind of evidence had the biggest effect in boosting public support? The words no social scientist wants to read are: “anecdotal evidence performs best”. But all is not lost. After all, while some politicians may only worry about what convinces the public that they are right, researchers are also interested in what the truth is in the first place. And there evidence trumps anecdote every time. • Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

You can also read our full report by our New Zealand correspondent, Tess McClure. Gabrielle is currently sitting 250km (155 miles) north-west of New Zealand’s coast and is forecast to move close to the east coast over the next 24 hours. Thousands of homes across the country are currently without power. Electricity is out for 46,000 homes, cell service is patchy in some areas and trees have come down and roofs lifted off. The emergency management minister, Kieran McAnulty, said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Almost all of the top half of the North Island has been covered by localised states of emergency including in Auckland – New Zealand’s largest city of 1.7 million people – as well as in Northland, Coromandel, Ōpōtiki, Whakatāne, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki. Communities in coastal regions evacuated on Monday. Mandatory evacuations were ordered along the entire eastern Bay of Plenty coastline – an area covering about 400 homes – as well as for 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region. There were concerns that the high tide – due to arrive around midnight on Monday – would coincide with the worst of the storm. National forecaster MetService said it had broken its record for “red” weather warnings issued around the country, and wind gusts of 150-160km/h were recorded. New Zealand prime minister Chris Hipkins warned the worst is yet to come as Cyclone Gabrielle sparks evacuations, rising flood waters and power outages across the North Island. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better,” Hipkins said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event.” Hipkins added that the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” as of 4pm on Monday but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. The New Zealand government announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. Air New Zealand cancelled 509 flights with 10,000 international customers affected by the disruptions. Normal services are expected to resume on Tuesday. The cyclone is the second significant weather event to hit Auckland and the upper North Island in just a few weeks. Last month Auckland and surrounding areas were hit by record rainfall that sparked floods and killed four people. A landslide crashed into a home in a coastal Coromandel Peninsula town, forcing its occupants to evacuate on Monday afternoon. Fire and emergency crews were alerted to the large slip in Hahei at 4.18pm on Monday, local news outlet Stuff reported. “From the information we can see, everyone is out of the house and a small number of people in the area are being evacuated,” a spokesperson said. “That’s as much detail as we can provide.” A “record storm surge” has been recorded in Whitianga, in the Waikato region of New Zealand’s North Island. The Whitianga monitoring station recorded a storm surge of 0.7 metres and rising, according to the Niwa forecast service. The surge measures the rise in water level above the normal tidal level. Rain engulfs North Island Radar images released by MetService show rain engulfing New Zealand’s North Island on Monday afternoon. Eight North Island regions have now declared states of emergency. Here are some of the latest images to come through our news wires this afternoon. Here Hauraki and Ōpōtiki have also announced local states of emergency – that’s most of the upper North Island now covered. At his 4pm press conference, prime minister Chris Hipkins said the “threshold for a national emergency has not yet been met” but officials were “getting an update every four hours” and reassessing. Waikato District Council has declared a local state of emergency, saying a number of areas around the Waikato River were now at high risk of flooding. At least five other North Island regions – Auckland, Whakatāne, Northland, Coromandel and Tairāwhiti – have declared local states of emergency, which allow councils special powers, including to conduct emergency evacuations. “With the worst of the weather due to hit overnight, we want to ensure that we are ready to respond taking whatever action necessary to keep our people safe,” said the Waikato District Council mayor, Jacqui Church. She also told residents to self-evacuate if their area was flooding. If there is surface flooding in your area and you see rising water, do not wait for official warnings. Head for higher ground and stay away from flood water. Storm reflects global importance of tackling climate crisis, Hipkins says The prime minister says that he’ll likely discuss recent weather emergencies in upcoming meetings with other world leaders – and that the storms illustrate the “global importance” of tackling climate change. I think we’re certainly bound to be asked about the weather in my discussions with other leaders... I’ll be sharing New Zealand’s experience and of course, it is an illustration of the global importance of tackling the challenge of climate change. Other countries are experiencing more extreme weather events as well – the globe is increasingly seeing the effects of climate change. Hipkins has spent some time discussing the government’s $11.5m in extra funding for cyclone relief. “It’s clear the demand for support is exceeding the funding available,” he said. “Extreme weather event has come on the back of extreme weather event. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better.” The prime minister, Chris Hipkins, is speaking to media now from Auckland. He says 25,000 people have so far been assisted with food, clothing, shelter, bedding and accommodation. “People have lost their homes and their vehicles, families are facing additional challenges getting children back to school. And many families will be facing anxiety and distress,” he said. The New Zealand government has just announced a $11.5m community support package to help tens of thousands of people affected by the recent floods as well as to prepare for the response to Cyclone Gabrielle. The minister for social development and employment, Carmel Sepuloni, said that the demand for support is exceeding funding available for community organisations and groups. Under the proposed support package, $4m will be given to providers to ensure they can “meet increased demand and support [the] wellbeing of their staff and volunteers” as well as $1m to replenish stocks at food banks currently experiencing high demand, according to a ministry statement shared with the Guardian. Another $2m of grants will be provided for community groups to support flood response and a $4m expansion of the scope of community connectors to support Auckland and impacted regions’ flood response efforts. A $500,000 ring fenced funding will also be included to respond to the needs of disabled people. Sepuloni said: This support package will provide immediate relief for individuals and families, bespoke support for disabled people like transport assistance, as well as support for the voluntary sector who continue to be at the heart of their communities and our response.” Sepuloni added that although “we’re not out of the woods yet” and the full extent of the damage was still unfolding, he said authorities needed to act swiftly to ensure people can continue to access support. “Our focus remains on the most affected communities including Māori, Pacific, disabled, youth and our ethnic communities, and the organisations and groups that work to support them,” he added. A mandatory evacuation order is currently in place for about 100 homes in the Whakatāne district in the Bay of Plenty region, which just declared a local state of emergency at 3pm on Monday. Acting mayor Lesley Immink said the declaration provides additional emergency management powers to the district controller and enables the civil defence response to call on support from outside the district if required. Emergency management powers allows our response team to do things like close off areas, evacuate people and get the resources needed to respond to this event. Auckland airport has also released an update, advising that there have been “significant flight cancellations” today. A total of 85 out of 104 scheduled international flights have been cancelled together with all 301 scheduled domestic flights, the airport said. Cyclone Gabrielle is approaching New Zealand’s North Island as more challenging conditions are set to come. Our video team has gathered some of the footage from the past few hours. The weather has also wreaked havoc on New Zealand’s travel network, with flights, trains and bus schedules all badly affected. Air New Zealand said they had so far cancelled 509 flights, but normal services were expected to resume on Tuesday. The airline said 10,000 international customers were disrupted, with 6,500 left to be rebooked. “With over 500 flight cancellations impacting more than 29,000 customers, we’re doing everything we can to get those disrupted back into the skies as quickly as possible,” the airline said in a statement on Monday afternoon. Thousands of homes in New Zealand are currently without power and flights have been grounded. Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said it would be a “critical day” due to the “highly dangerous” combination of high winds and heavy rain. Although the storm has weakened from its previous cyclone status, it has already toppled trees, damaged roads and downed power lines. A state of emergency has been declared in five northern regions including Auckland. Some 58,000 people in New Zealand’s North Island are without power. Officials warn it could take days to restore the network. “As long as the weather continues to be as severe as it is, it’s actually unsafe” to work on the network, McAnulty said. Another quick snap here from MetService showing strong winds expected across the majority of the country. In northern New Zealand, some of the highest gusts have been recorded. The forecaster recorded winds of up to 163km/h at Channel Island and 144 km/h at Mokohinau Island. National forecaster MetService has issued a heavy rain warning, together with a red and strong wind warning predicted to last until Wednesday. Wind gusts of 150-160 km/h, and some stations in Gisborne have recorded rain rates of 15-30mm in a single hour, the forecaster said. Wind gusts also reached up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. These winds are expected to produce widespread damage, especially to trees and power lines and could lift roofs. Transport and power networks are likely to be significantly impacted, with road closures and power outages. Conditions will be hazardous for motorists and there is a danger to life from flying debris and falling trees or branches. Emergency services log 198 weather-related incidents Fire and Emergency New Zealand district manager Brad Mosby has also provided an update, saying that said over the past 12 hours, from 1am, there had been 198 incidents logged related to severe weather. Most have been related to wind damage, he added. There were 91 incidents recorded in Northland, 62 in Auckland and 35 in Waikato, mainly from the Coromandel. As rain intensifies, more calls relating to flooding are coming through, Moseby said. Worst of wind to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday MetService meteorologist Georgina Griffiths has said the cyclone is about halfway through and the most challenging wind conditions are set to batter parts of Auckland on Tuesday. Griffiths said rainfall has made the ground soggy again, however no major flooding has happened yet. We do not expect everyone to see the heavier rain rates, however those who do will see localised impacts such as slips and floods. The wind is expected to return from the south-west overnight and tomorrow. A storm surge is still likely for eastern Auckland around 2am, however effects will be less than previously expected, Griffiths said. ‘We’re not out of the woods yet,’ Auckland residents warned Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, has said the effects of the cyclone will get worse before they get better. “We’re not out of the woods yet,” she told reporters during a live briefing on Monday. Auckland residents urged to stay home The mayor of Auckland, Wayne Brown, has said the next 24 hours will be challenging, urging residents to stay home. As long as it’s safe, stay home … It’s going to be a hard night and a very difficult week. For many, the recovery will be long.” Officials are gathering to provide a live update on Cyclone Gabrielle in Auckland today. Representatives from the MetService, Auckland council, the NZDF, fire and emergency and other organisations are joining Auckland emergency management at 2pm local time. Speaking are Georgina Griffiths from MetService, Colonel Mel Childs from the defence force, fire and emergency district manager Brad Mosby, Vector’s chief operating officer Peter Ryan, Auckland mayor Wayne Brown and Auckland transport’s general manager of safety, Stacey van der Putten. We will bring you all the latest lines shortly. Defence force on standby The New Zealand defence force has located 150 staff across Auckland and neighbouring regions as they bring in welfare supplies to civil defence centres and shelters. A statement issued by the force on Monday morning read: About 150 NZDF personnel and mix of vehicle types are positioned ready to respond across the Northland, Auckland, Coromandel and Bay of Plenty areas. Teams have also been assisting in the establishment of Civil Defence centres and shelters across Auckland including delivering more than 50 pallets of emergency supplies including blankets, tea, coffee, air mattresses, sleeping bags and warm clothes. Rain and wind expected to intensify The approach of Cyclone Gabrielle is bringing particularly strong winds, heavy rain and huge swells to Auckland and nearby regions. Gabrielle is now sitting just north of New Zealand, with weather forecasters expecting rain and winds to intensify as it nears land during Monday and Tuesday. Rachel Kelleher, deputy controller Auckland emergency management, warned that the cyclone was “still in its early stages” and more severe weather is to come. The impact of Gabrielle is still in its early stages and further serious and severe weather is still expected for Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) later today into Tuesday morning. Now is not the time for complacency. Person missing on boat off Great Barrier Island A search is under way to for a person missing on a boat off the coast of Great Barrier Island. A police spokesperson said police had responded to reports of a boat in distress around 2.15am. “Enquiries are ongoing to locate one person aboard a water vessel near Great Barrier Island this morning.” The Police Maritime and Eagle – helicopter response – units had “attempted to approach the boat throughout the morning, however conditions have been challenging, and at this stage no one has been located,” they said. Police will make further attempts to approach the vessel when conditions allow. Chris Hipkins may miss opening of parliament Prime minister Chris Hipkins may miss the scheduled opening of parliament tomorrow if he remains trapped in Auckland by Cyclone Gabrielle. Hipkins traveled to Auckland to attend cyclone preparation briefings and speak to Apec business council. With all domestic flights in and out of Auckland currently cancelled until at least midday tomorrow, the prime minister’s chances of getting back to parliament to deliver the prime minister’s statement – traditional on the first house sitting of the year – are looking narrow. Cellphone service disrupted by storm As well as power outages, there are disruptions to cellphone coverage – primarily in the upper North Island – with some cell phone sites out due to power outages or wind damage. Vodafone, Spark and 2 Degrees all say they have a number of sites down. Forecasters and weather monitoring agencies are forecasting huge swells around the North Island – and warning people to stay away. National forecaster Metservice says the worst weather is still to come – and that it has already broken records for the most “red” weather warnings ever issued. Some of the key points from their statement at noon: Cyclone Gabrielle is bearing down on the North Island, and despite widespread damage and disruption last night and this morning, the worst weather is still to come for many regions today. “This is a major weather system and shouldn’t be taken lightly,” explains meteorologist Angus Hines. “We have a couple more days of wild weather ahead. We’ve never had such an extensive range of Red Severe Weather Warnings – which are the highest classification of Severe Weather Warning MetService can issue.” Many of the red rain warnings are for already waterlogged regions, following last month’s floods. Those warnings are currently in place for Northland, Auckland, the Coromandel Peninsula and the north of Tairāwhiti/Gisborne. Angus says: All of these places have already dealt with immense rainfall this year, and lots of them are in clean-up mode from recent flooding. Unfortunately, we expect further flooding, slips power outages, and road closures Monday and Tuesday, prolonging this unprecedented wet summer. Evacuations advised in some low-lying, coastal communities Evacuations are under way in some coastal, low-lying and river-adjacent communities. In Whangarei, the district council has advised residents living close to rivers in the central business district and Town Basin area to evacuate before high tide at 1.56pm, “because of a high risk of coastal flooding”. An evacuation centre has opened at McKay Stadium. Elsewhere around the North Island, some communities have been self-evacuating, but officials don’t yet have data on how many. At an 11am press conference, emergency management official Roger Ball said there was no precise number of evacuations at that point. Twenty-four Civil Defence centres and shelters opened up in Auckland overnight, including three mass evacuation centres. New Zealanders are advised to check with their local Civil Defence for details on evacuations. Cyclone tracking southward So far the centre of the cyclone is sitting just north of New Zealand, and moving slowly southward. Here’s a satellite image from an hour ago: You can track the cyclone via satellite in real time via Metservice. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Cyclone Gabrielle. I’m Tess McClure, I’m based in Auckland, and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they come in. Here is what we know so far: 58,000 homes in the North Island are without power, and some in the Northland region may not have it restored for around a week. Auckland, Northland, Coromandel and the Tairāwhiti region have declared states of emergency. As of 11am, government officials said they were assessing every four hours whether a national state of emergency would be declared. Evacuations have begun in some low-lying and coastal communities. The cyclone has not yet made landfall, and the worst of the storm’s effects are yet to arrive, emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty said on Monday morning: “Today is the critical day in the event with a highly dangerous combination of high winds and heavy rain.” National forecaster MetService has issued 30 weather warnings nationwide, with “red” weather and rain warnings for Auckland and Northland. Wind gusts have reaches up to 140km/h in Northland and 135km/h in the Hauraki Gulf, outside Auckland. Auckland residents have been urged to stay home and ensure they have supplies for up to three days. Most Auckland flights and all trains are cancelled and almost every school is shut. The cyclone comes a fortnight after devastating floods in Auckland and around the North Island, which killed four, damaged thousands of homes and left 370 households still in emergency accommodation. The severe winds and rain would come on top of already sodden land, risking structural problems, landslips, falling trees and power line problems. The whole Auckland region was at risk of flooding, emergency management officials said on Monday. Minister urges people urged to hunker down Emergency management minister Kieran McAnulty has just finished up a briefing in Auckland, urging people to finalise their preparations and then hunker down. “To those where the weather hasn’t hit but it’s projected to, please use the time that you’ve got to get prepared. As we’ve seen in those areas that have now been hit, using that time to get prepared can make all the difference.” Some supermarkets have run out of high-demand items, but he said those shortages would be temporary, and told people to resist panic buying. “We’re encouraging people to … only get what they need. In an event like this three days should be enough.” He ended by urging against unnecessary risk-taking – including surfers who could be tempted by huge swells. Please don’t go out in the flood water, please don’t go out in the high swells. We’re seeing reports and projections that some of the swells around coastal New Zealand are going to be absolutely massive – look, I’m conscious that some people might find that appealing and they might want to go surfing or whatever … please don’t do something that if you get caught will drag emergency responders away from their core task."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T03:00:07Z","webTitle":"Selfies, sendoffs and star power as Jacinda Ardern has her last day in the sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/25/jacinda-ardern-last-day-new-zealand-prime-minister-selfies-sendoffs-star-power","fields":{"bodyText":"From the moment of her arrival, Jacinda Ardern is surrounded by a crush of people: hundreds gather to ask for final selfies, record video messages for friends and relatives, or simply watch her pass by. A group of running children weaves through bystanders’ legs, pushing for a better view. Over and over, she obliges, smiling for cameraphones, asking people’s names and jobs, cracking jokes, signing a worn blue and yellow basketball for a boy who pushes through the crowd. A politician who always excelled at creating moments of humour and human connection, Ardern’s much-discussed star power was firmly on display in the North Island village of Rātana on Tuesday for her last formal engagement as the prime minister of New Zealand. “It’s like, ‘touch her cloak, touch her cloak like Jesus’,” a woman laughs to her friend. “Where is she? Is she coming?” a girl asked, craning for a glimpse. “I just want to tell her thank you,” a woman outside the Rātana temple tells a policeman standing nearby. “For everything.” One man spends a minute vigorously and continuously shaking her hand. “You’re going to have to let go at some point,” an onlooker remarks, and the crowd laughs. New Zealand – and the world – is still reckoning with Ardern’s shock departure, the whirlwind selection of her replacement, and the question of how to define her political legacy. On her final full day as the country’s leader, however, some of the thornier and more controversial questions of her political legacy and legislative record seemed to fade into the background. *** Rātana traditionally marks the beginning of New Zealand’s political year, with party leaders descending on the village to give their first major speeches after the summer break. This year was different, it also marked the ending of an era. The scenes recalled some of the electric fandom Ardern provoked when she first took the leadership in 2017 – greeted by scrums of hopeful selfie-takers and fans. Five years of difficult decisions and political struggles had worn much of that glitter away, particularly in the polls, where voters had punished the prime minister and her party for a year of economic headwinds. But on Tuesday, the shine was back on. A few metres away, the incoming prime minister Chris Hipkins stands in a circle of reporters, answering questions – for the most part, the crowd doesn’t look his way. There was no sign on Tuesday of the small, furious knot of protesters who had become an increasingly recurrent presence at Ardern’s public appearances – sometimes bearing signs and anti-vaccine slogans, other times chasing her van and screaming obscenities. Ardern has said threats and abuse were not contributing factors to her resignation, but her departure has still prompted the start of an uncomfortable reckoning in New Zealand with the scope and volume of misogynistic, violent rhetoric, abuse and threats channelled the leader’s way. Speaking briefly to reporters, she said that her enduring experience of the job had been positive. “I would hate for anyone to view my departure as a negative commentary on New Zealand,” she said. “I have experienced such love, compassion, empathy and kindness in the job. That has been my predominant experience. So I leave feeling gratitude for having this wonderful role for so many years … My only words are words of thanks.” *** As they waited for the prime minister, tribal elders and politicians sheltered in plastic marquees from the blast of late-summer sun. The grass lining the roads to the marae (meeting place) has grown long and parched, worn down to fibre by the summer heat and signalling a season winding down. As her tenure ends, the question of Ardern’s ongoing influence on the direction and tone of New Zealand politics remains open. Even before she arrived at Rātana’s borders, the figure of Ardern loomed large over the political speeches of the day. Centre-right opposition leader Christopher Luxon made no explicit mention of the prime minister, but chose to speak about his vision of the “kindness politics” that she ushered in. We will “demonstrate kindness, demonstrate that we care, through careful stewardship of the economy”, he said – a choice of framing that seemed only to illustrate the degree to which Ardern had come to determine the language and frames of reference of New Zealand’s political conversation. Most of the leaders paid their tributes more overtly. “You were the captain calling the shots on the waka [canoe] that navigated us through truly tough times,” said Rahui Papa, a leader within the Tainui and Māori king movements. “You were the right person to lead our nation through terrible times,” said Che Wilson, previous president of the Māori party. “I wear my political allegiances here,” he said, pointing to the Indigenous designs patterning his attire, “but prime minister, it is only right that we say thank you,” he said, as the crowd erupted into applause. Asked if she had a parting word for the public, the prime minister said she would not be disappearing entirely. “You will see me out and about, but you won’t see me in the centre, in the cut and thrust of politics,” she said. On whether she would miss that, Ardern replied simply: “I’m going to miss people. Because that’s been the joy of the job.” *** The celebrations at Rātana are an appropriate final bookend for Ardern’s term. In 2018 – just two months into her prime ministership and a few days after her pregnancy with daughter Neve was announced – she appeared at Rātana. That year, Rātana elders offered her a Māori middle name for her child: Waru, a sacred number for the church. Over the years that followed, the gathering has marked milestones and moments of Ardern’s tenure as a leader – and watched her family grow up, with Neve occasionally making appearances to toddle through the crowds, chased by security guards. In a final, brief standup for reporters, Ardern said it was spending more time in that role – as mother and family member – that she was looking forward to. “I’m ready to be lots of things,” she said. “I’m ready to be a backbench MP. I’m ready to be a sister, and a mum.” Then she turned, replaced her sunglasses, and walked away from the last cluster of microphones she would face as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
