Not a single person out of step. Trumpets, drums, bagpipes, all heralding the end of an era. Cannons firing, bells ringing, Big Ben chiming, choirboys singing. Row upon row of servicemen and servicewomen, faces etched in solemn regard. Columns of guardsmen, helmets gleaming, plumes wafting, bearskins bobbing. Line after line passes soberly by – a river of scarlet and gold in an ocean of black. The crowds bear witness to it all, a nation joined as one in solidarity for a queen the like of which we will never see again. Unforgettable. Jon Goldney Gawler, South Australia • I am on vacation from the US in the UK. While not normally a royal follower, I decided that I had to do the British thing and watch the Queen’s funeral. It was impressive. I am glad I live in a world that still has pageantry. I am glad I live in a world that can still have things that serve no practical purpose, such as kings and queens, and soldiers who have swords on their belts, fur on their hats, and move like trained dancers. I hope that there will always be room in this world for soldiers who aren’t carrying guns. Emily Anne Lyons Annandale, New Jersey, US • Charlotte Higgins (It was a gilded royal funeral, an event that will only heighten our self-delusion, 20 September) pretty much said what I feel, and the historical details she added – about the disastrous funeral of George IV, for example – were fascinating. Let us hope that there will be far fewer feathers the next time. I was particularly impressed by her careful use of the word “fulsome” to describe the BBC’s commentary. A shame she felt that she had to add the words “and mawkish” after it in order not to be misunderstood. Michael Bulley Chalon-sur-Saône, France • If Charlotte Higgins was reminded of RSC productions of Shakespeare’s history plays, the image may have been reinforced by the BBC camera picking out the portrait of one king in the abbey: Richard II. John Pelling Coddenham, Suffolk • The mood of gritty realism that describes life in modern Britain (unemployment, food bank visits, unplanned pregnancies) was briefly punctured in Ambridge on Monday when a funeral was briefly mentioned in The Archers, after the actual event had taken place in a parallel unreal world. At least the whole of the BBC did not succumb to royal overkill. John Petrie Leeds • How do you explain to granddaughters aged 10 and eight why not a single girl chorister was included in the three choirs represented at the Queen’s obsequies? There was one woman among the altos at St George’s chapel in Windsor, presumably brought in to beef up that line a bit. Girls sing the treble line just as beautifully as boys do, and it is high time we scrapped this ridiculous Anglican cathedral tradition, as they have already done at a few cathedrals. Tully Potter Tonbridge, Kent • Farewell to the Queen. The funeral was emotional; it made us proud of our country. It also felt like the last hurrah of the British empire. The last hurrah of a former world power. Hubert Schmitz Brighton, East Sussex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ryan Murphy – once renowned as the very Midas of soapy, campy television – has had a stock market crash this year on a par with the streaming giant’s own plummet. (Who’s working on the Venn diagram?) Murphy would once make hit after hit that hooked us without fail. This year, his output has gone from the outright tedious to the truly sickening. The worst offender was Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which despite being grisly, nauseating and fetishistic about a serial killer who ate some of his victims, rode high in the Netflix charts for weeks on end. The other Murphian show that nearly made the cut here was The Watcher, which starred Jennifer Coolidge but was ultimately a duff thriller about a typewriter. Let’s hope Murphy’s next series of Feud – in which Truman Capote makes delicious rifts in New York high society – makes up for all this awfulness. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Given the horrific racism that swirled around this show’s casting of non-white actors, as well as the glorious stand that Lord of the Rings stars past and present took against it, it’s not easy to say unkind things about this fantasy drama. But the fact remains that the show was a masterclass in mediocrity. Visually, it was stunning – but it needed to be, given that its reported billion dollar production budget supposedly made it the most expensive TV show ever created. However, its storylines were glacially tedious, its acting – with the exception of Morfydd Clark’s Galadriel – comically po-faced, and in the maddeningly twee harfoots and their Oirish accents, it created a set of characters that were like Jar Jar Binks for a new milennium – if Jar Jar Binks had been so offensively stereotypical he was borderline xenophobic. Given the amount of money this burned through for a show that launched during a cost of living crisis, it’s tempting to ask whether this series was the worst value TV ever created – and hard not to respond with a resounding “yes”. Conversations With Friends After the huge success of Normal People, this adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel should have also been a hit. As the story of an affair unravelled, all the Rooneyisms were there: tightly packed dialogue, observations on class, growth and identity, a lot of longing stares, and endless space for intimacy. But what it lacked was a screen couple worth investing in – Nick and Frances were drips, and you had to sit through what felt like 27 hours to get to the real relationship of the story (Frances and Bobbi). Brilliant book; absolute snoozefest of a series. Chivalry With comedy giants Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani at the helm, and guest stars including Sienna Miller, Lolly Adefope and Wanda Sykes, this should have been a searing swipe at Hollywood in the #MeToo era. As Coogan’s character – a top producer terrified of being cancelled – meets the indie director (Solemani) he’s enlisted to help with his problematic new film, the sex scene they work on initially made it look as though we were in for a nuanced series with some sharp gags, which was never too on-the-nose. But it quickly drifted off and became confused about what it was, with the comedy faltering as the show went on. And the romcom-style ending was just bewildering – at no point were you rooting for them to get together. For a project that could have said so much about the state of things, it’s hard to remember what was said in it at all. Ten Percent In a world that seems to be populated by a new streaming service every few weeks, there should be no end of thrilling new stories to binge watch at will. So it was a curious and misguided decision by the ravine-deep pocketed Prime Video to commission an entirely pointless remake of the French hit Call My Agent. That show – about a bunch of chic, zingy agents to the stars – steadily became a word-of-mouth smash, snaring more A-listers to play their clients by the day. In the end, Juliette Binoche and Sigourney Weaver were banging the door down to be “represented” by the Agence Samuel Kerr. So why did Prime bother to make a lazy reproduction that was essentially a shot-for-shot knock-off? Even having the likes of John Morton of W1A fame as the writer didn’t lend this its own witty or satirical voice. Some of the British stars were worth a watch (Dominic West, in particular). But fans of the original knew exactly what we were letting ourselves in for – a British cast bringing a rehashed storyline absolutely no je ne sais quoi. Peaky Blinders There was much to love about this last season, from the tense opening barfight to the finale shootout with the IRA, which was so disorientingly murky and gas-filled it felt otherworldly. But it struggled to ever quite get going, with the first five episodes dragging their feet in a way that began to frustrate. No season of a show as good as this will ever be genuinely bad TV, but compared to previous outings, it lacked zing – not exactly what you’d expect for a series that was meant to be Tommy Shelby’s televisual swansong. In the end, the final scenes stopped short of offering any solid explanation for this being the end of the gang leader’s small-screen journey, serving only as setup for the forthcoming film. Not quite the definitive farewell we hoped for. The Witchfinder Given the stellar roster of comic talent involved in this sitcom, you’d expect it to be topping lists of the year’s best shows. Tim Key starred as a hapless witchfinder taking suspected witch Daisy May Cooper to trial, in a script written by the Gibbon brothers, the brains behind Alan Partridge’s renaissance. Despite seemingly every minor part being filled by a comic luminary – Ghosts’ Kiell Smith-Bynoe as hired muscle here, Julian Barratt as a fellow witchfinder there – it lacked the solid gags its pedigree demanded. No question that the stars shone in their roles, but it struggled to ever make you genuinely laugh. Midwich Cuckoos You’re usually on to a good thing when Keeley Hawes is involved. That said, last year’s Finding Alice was awful, as was this year’s Crossfire, and this adaptation of John Wyndham’s 1957 sci-fi book completes her terrible TV trifecta (although Hawes’s turn as psychotherapist Dr Susannah Zellaby is probably the only good thing about it). As Hawes embarked on her mission to get to the bottom of what all the freaky children of Midwich are up to, the parents’ glacial realisation that they’d spawned little creeps was borderline comical – given their terrifyingly stony stares and 1970s haircuts. The acting was mostly bad, the budget felt very low and the story offered nothing new in the context of women’s reproductive rights in 2022, which – as the women all become pregnant at once without realising – felt like a wasted opportunity. Killing Eve This adaptation of the Villanelle novels has long been on the slide, but this series reached new lows. A far cry from the days when Phoebe Waller-Bridge was involved and it was one of TV’s finest shows, its plot was increasingly nonsensical, it inexplicably lacked the fabulous couture outfits it was once feted for and it wrapped up with an ending containing such a disappointingly anti-LGBTQ trope that the author of the original books felt compelled to write a whole article disclaiming it. What a shame. Pistol National treasure Danny Boyle directs the iconic tale of Sex Pistols, as depicted in guitarist Steve Jones’s moving and funny autobiography: a guarantee of success, you might think. But this six-part Disney+ adaptation fell flat, with cartoonish characters that made the show feel like pantomime. What should have been absolutely spectacular TV instead felt tonally odd – and it never quite landed its attempt to bridge nihilism and sentimentality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/01/icac-under-fire-the-nsw-corruption-commission-has-made-some-powerful-enemies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T00:00:04Z","webTitle":"Icac under fire: the NSW corruption commission has made some powerful enemies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/01/icac-under-fire-the-nsw-corruption-commission-has-made-some-powerful-enemies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/01/icac-under-fire-the-nsw-corruption-commission-has-made-some-powerful-enemies","fields":{"bodyText":"The age-old criticisms resurfaced within days of Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation as NSW premier on 1 October 2021. The Independent Commission Against Corruption was derided as a “star chamber” and a “kangaroo court”. The commission, according to then prime minister Scott Morrison, had treated his party’s NSW leader disgracefully. It was more interested in headlines than integrity, due process or the rule of law, he said. Some of Morrison’s MPs went even further. “The NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption is an obscenity,” then Liberal MP Jason Falinski said. “It is star chamber, kangaroo court, crowd-sourced McCarthyism all rolled into one.” It’s a familiar pattern. Three premiers have resigned while under Icac’s unforgiving scrutiny. Barry O’Farrell resigned after Icac found a thank-you note that contradicted his emphatic denials of having received a $3,000 bottle of Grange from the chief of the company lobbying intensively for a water contract. Nick Greiner, whose administration created Icac, was forced out due to Icac findings over the appointment of a former minister to a public service role, which were later successfully appealed. Each big name scalp precipitated furious political backlash. Anthony Whealy, a former NSW supreme court judge turned integrity campaigner, says Icac’s proven ability to resist the pressure shows its strength and its success. “An organisation like this has to possess independence, impartiality, be incorruptible, and it must be fearless,” he says. “By that I mean it must not pay any heed to whether it receives praise or condemnation for its findings.” When Greiner established the Icac 35 years ago, he trumpeted the importance of its independence of executive government. Its independence and its strong powers, equivalent to those of a standing royal commission, gave it the fearlessness it needed to rid the state of corruption, he believed. Greiner acted after a seemingly never-ending string of corruption scandals: a state minister jailed for bribery; two ministers facing a corruption inquiry; a magistrate charged with perverting the course of justice. In setting up Icac, Greiner was clear-eyed about the perennial dilemma it would face: how does such a body balance the inevitable tension between the right of an individual to the presumption of innocence and to privacy, with the need to robustly and transparently ensure governments are free from corruption? Greiner predicted the commission would come under attack for “unjustified interference with the rights of individuals”. His retort? Corruption was by its nature secretive, difficult to uncover and a crime of the powerful, with no obvious victim willing to complain. It required strong investigative powers to root it out, as long as they were focused on the public sector and kept in check by parliamentary committee. “The bottom line is simply this: the people of this state are fed up with half-hearted and cosmetic approaches to preventing public sector corruption,” he said. ‘Worse than the Spanish inquisition’ On 5 July 2018, the disgraced MP Daryl Maguire called his then secret lover, Berejiklian, and let loose on the corruption watchdog. His phone was being tapped. Maguire, who had just been summoned by Icac to explain his property dealings, told Berejiklian it was “worse than the Spanish fucking inquisition”. He told her he couldn’t even “meet with a developer” and said “what they’re doing is marginalising the art of politics”. “And big brother, you know, they can, they can tap into every phone conversation there is, absolutely unfettered power, no one has any privacy,” he said. “They could probably actually listen to any calls that were being made between me and this phone and any individual that I choose to talk to including you.” Berejiklian responded: “Is that going to be a problem?” It was a problem. Quite a significant problem, for both Maguire and Berejiklian. On Thursday both were found by Icac to have engaged in corrupt conduct. Maguire may face charges, but Icac has not recommended charges be pursued against Berejiklian. She may also appeal against the findings. The wire taps, as intrusive as they were, played a key role in establishing the commission’s findings. They showed time and again how the undisclosed relationship between Maguire and Berejiklian crossed a line, interfering in her public duties and clouding her support of two lucrative funding commitments sought by her then secret lover, one for a gun club and another for a music conservatorium. The taps also showed Berejiklian’s awareness of Maguire’s land dealings, the commissions he was receiving while in office, and the importance of his private property brokering in digging himself out of personal debt. It was something Icac found Berejiklian should have raised with the anti-corruption watchdog. The findings triggered familiar criticisms of Icac. Some – most notably, the criticism of delay – are shared across the political spectrum and are likely to lead to reform. Others suggested Icac had gone too far and needed to be brought into line. The former Liberal MP Jason Falinski said on Twitter Icac had made a finding of corruption with “no evidence of corruption” and suggested the delivery of the findings was “mostly a made for media event, not the proceedings of a proper corruption body”. The former NSW auditor-general Tony Harris says Operation Keppel, if nothing else, has shown that “no one is above being investigated for corruption”. “Not even the most powerful member of the executive.” Harris, while airing concerns about the delay, says the constant criticisms of Icac are ill-founded because they ignore the model the commission follows and the checks and balances that surround it. “Clearly the Icac is no star chamber, if only because those suspected of corruption have lawyers to help them, often paid for by the taxpayer,” he says. “And, unlike the original star chamber, the Icac is answerable to Parliament, not the chief minister or king. “Moreover, the Icac is not a court and cannot declare a person guilty. The only adverse finding allowed of the Icac is that it can find a person engaged in corrupt, not necessarily illegal, activity.” He says the body can act as a model for corruption watchdogs in other jurisdictions, including the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which is officially established from Saturday. “The Icac was established under, at the time, model legislation,” he says. “And this legislation has been improved by amendments. “This legislation is a good start for jurisdictions wanting a similar body.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T13:00:41Z","webTitle":"Over 100 engineers work to restore power to thousands of Shetland homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/dec/14/over-100-engineers-work-to-restore-power-to-thousands-of-shetland-homes","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 100 engineers are being sent to Shetland after heavy snowstorms cut power to thousands of homes, many of which face being without electricity until the end of this week. A major incident has been declared, with householders urged to remain at home after heavy loads of ice and snow brought down electricity lines to nearly 4,000 homes earlier this week. With 2,800 homes still without power, Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said 15 emergency crews had arrived by ferry at Lerwick early on Wednesday morning, with emergency generators being used in some places. The power company said other crews would arrive from mainland Scotland and Orkney during the day and into Thursday by plane, ferry and helicopter, taking the number of extra engineers sent to Shetland to 125. Graeme Keddie, SSEN’s director of corporate affairs, told BBC Radio Scotland: “This has been a very concentrated and explosive weather event on Shetland, which has been far worse than expected. Local crews say it is the worst they have seen it since 1995.” The storm brought down parts of Shetland’s main 33kV electricity network cutting power to homes on Voe, Whalsay, Brae, Yell and West Mainland. SSEN has deployed a helicopter to help survey the damage. Customers in West Mainland are likely to be without power until the weekend. The crime writer Ann Cleeves issued an appeal for help after losing a laptop in the storm containing half of her new novel. She had searched for the “scruffy” Hewlett Packard device in Mareel arts centre and the public library in Lerwick without success. Cleeves, the author of the Shetland series of crime novels, tweeted: All of the islands’ schools remained closed, with Sumburgh airport, the main airport for Shetland, closed overnight by further snow. Leisure centres were also shut. Emma Macdonald, the leader of Shetland Islands council, told the BBC the weather was unusual. A car journey that should normally take 25 minutes took her five hours during Monday’s storm. “The community is very resilient, as an island we have to be, and we have seen a lot of community support, everyone pulling together to do what they can,” she said. “There is a lot of snow, a lot of wet snow and it is sticking on the lines which is the issue. It is very unprecedented, I don’t think it can be blamed on the electricity company.” SSEN said it would fund emergency accommodation costs for vulnerable households on its priority services register and pay up to £30 a day to cover hot food costs for those able to travel to areas with power. The islands had a serious communications outage for several days in October, when two undersea cables were cut, leaving many islanders without mobile, computer and landline telephone services. Fishing trawlers are thought to have snagged the cables, which connected Shetland to mainland Scotland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/jan/17/scottish-power-install-prepayment-meter-customers-gas-account","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-17T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"Scottish Power plans to install a prepayment meter – but we are not customers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jan/17/scottish-power-install-prepayment-meter-customers-gas-account","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/jan/17/scottish-power-install-prepayment-meter-customers-gas-account","fields":{"bodyText":"We are desperate. Scottish Power is about to force its way in to install a prepayment meter in our north London home – despite the fact that we are not even customers – and there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do to stop it. It appears that, at some point, our gas account was erroneously switched to Scottish Power by a neighbour who was trying to change her supplier. She somehow selected the wrong address from a drop-down menu, inputting ours instead. We have been paying our gas bills by direct debit as usual but started getting bills to an unknown person so sent them back thinking they had the wrong address. Having finally opened the most recent one last week, we were shocked to discover the company has gone to court for nonpayment and is about to break down our door and install a new meter. We have been on the phone for the past three days but keep getting passed from department to department, with no one willing, or able, to halt this. We don’t owe this company any money. Please, please help. SS, London This is a great example of why you should always open letters sent to your address, even if you have never heard of the person named. Clearly this was in no way your fault – but it could have been dealt with much earlier had you opened the mail. Equally, this was not of Scottish Power’s making. The supplier to which your neighbour was trying to switch, Entice Energy, later collapsed and Scottish Power inherited its customers and debts. However, the company could have acted better and halted proceedings after you got in touch. Telling you, as it did, that there was nothing that could be done to stop the warrant from being carried out was cavalier, to say the least. Fortunately, after I contacted the firm, someone in the press office was able to halt the action at the 11th hour, and your front door remains intact. Had we not got involved, and had the meter change gone ahead, it would have been an expensive nightmare to sort out. Scottish Power has apologised for the “distress and frustration you experienced due to the previous supplier’s failures”. It says: “We will remove all debt and late payment fees from the account, as well as making a payment to their account as a gesture of goodwill.” You are just hugely relieved, and, I suspect, will be opening any future letters that turn up.

Amendments added to the economic crime and corporate transparency bill will bring a swift end to the vast majority of Slapps (strategic lawsuits against public participation), ministers claim. The government has been under pressure to legislate on the issue amid concerns Slapps are being used by wealthy individuals – especially Russian oligarchs – to stifle free speech and deter investigations into their affairs by journalists, writers and campaigners. The amendments create an early dismissal mechanism in the courts based on two tests: whether a case is a Slapp and whether the claim has a reasonable chance of being successful. The onus will be on the complainants to prove that their case has merit, rather than on the defendant. The justice secretary, Alex Chalk, said: “These measures will protect the values of freedom of speech that underpin our democracy and help better protect reporters who are shining a light on their crimes.” The definition of a Slapp in the bill refers to behaviour by the claimant that “has, or is intended to have, the effect of restraining the defendant’s exercise of the right to freedom of speech”. Their behaviour must also be intended to cause the defendant harassment, alarm or distress, expense or any other harm or convenience beyond that ordinarily encountered in litigation. The new law is limited to information in the public interest related to economic crime, which at least 70% of UK Slapps relate to, according to research from the Foreign Policy Centre (FPC), disappointing campaigners who want a broader application. The UK Anti-Slapp Coalition, co-chaired by the FPC, Index on Censorship and English Pen, welcomed the amendment but said it should protect all public interest speech. It also expressed concerns that it was contingent on the intent of the claimant, which it said could be a difficult, time-consuming and costly exercise to prove. Susan Coughtrie, the director of the FPC, said the amendments were “a crucial step towards preventing those benefiting from proceeds of crime from being able to use them to shut down scrutiny into that wrongdoing by misusing UK law. Nevertheless, this is only a partial success story – the UK government must move as quickly as possible to ensure such protections are available to all those subject to Slapps, regardless of the subject matter.” The amendments come days after the former cabinet minister David Davis used a point of order in parliament to hail a high court judge’s decision to strike out a defamation claim brought by the Conservative party donor Mohamed Amersi against the former Tory MP Charlotte Leslie as “a great victory for free speech”. Davis called the case a Slapp, but this has been rejected by Amersi who said “nothing could be further from the truth”. A 2020 FPC report, which surveyed investigative journalists in 41 countries working to uncover financial crime and corruption, found the UK to be by far the most frequent international country of origin for legal threats after the reporters’ home countries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/jun/12/past-lives-celine-song-film","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T17:15:25Z","webTitle":"Past Lives: the powerful yearning of what might be 2023’s best movie","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/12/past-lives-celine-song-film","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jun/12/past-lives-celine-song-film","fields":{"bodyText":"There’s a section in Past Lives, Celine Song’s gorgeous, deft debut film about a pair of reconnecting childhood sweethearts, that immediately portaled me to the year 2011. It was not the fashion, which is vaguely of a time past, nor a character’s old iPhone interface, nor the math provided for the film’s flashbacks, but the particular doo-do-doo of a Skype ringtone on an open laptop, that ersatz sonar of long-distance connection. Nora Moon (Greta Lee, a fascinating mix of sharp and soft) is an aspiring playwright in her early 20s in New York City, and has engaged in a very familiar late 2000s game: searching the names of old connections on Facebook to see what they’re up to now. Who’s successful? Who turned out hot? What traces remain of the person you once knew? Hae Sung, the boy Nora had a crush on as a child – the one she liked and trusted enough to admit to her mother, in the days before her family immigrated from Seoul to Canada, that she might marry him – grew up to be handsome. (He’s played as an adult by South Korean star Teo Yoo, who is somehow just as convincing as a 23-year-old as he is in his late 30s). And he thought about her, too. In another period-right detail, Nora discovers a Facebook comment by Hae Sung on a post about her father: back in Seoul, out of the military, he wondered what happened to his old friend. She reaches out on Facebook; they pivot to Skype. Since its debut at Sundance in January, Past Lives has accrued slow-rolling, deserved hype – as the year’s first great movie, as an achingly effective love story, as a rare emotionally mature adult film somewhere between the romantic and the platonic. (I’ll add that, secondary to the delicate narrative, Song’s depiction of New York is the most lived-in, tangible and vibrant, that I’ve seen in ages.) Many have focused, not wrongly, on Song’s delicate rendering of both reconnection – the tender bond that comes from having known someone, in presence and absence, for almost as long as you’ve known yourself – and of marriage. By the time Hae Sung visits New York in the present, well into their 30s, Nora is in a long-term, supportive, emotionally communicative relationship with Arthur (an excellent John Magaro), a fellow writer. But it’s that Skype interlude that, for me, captures the film’s quiet power: its mature, acute understanding of inexpressible feelings and undefinable relationships, ones fostered by the passage of time and the presence of screens. Back in 2011, freshly in touch in their early 20s, Hae Sung and Nora are stunned by the image of their screens: the face of a sweet spot and a question, beamed across the present and haloed by the laptop glow. They’re both nervous, tentative. And then they fall into a new, intoxicating rhythm: rushing home to open the laptop, fumbling for the right angle on the webcam, curling into the languorous comfort of a long, ambling call. They talk about their days, their futures, their jokes, their old friendship. They miss calls and are distracted and have their offline lives warped by the weird, magnetic pulse of their long-distance, siloed correspondence. In a succinct, evocative sequence, Song conveys the cherished accumulation of their calls and messages, which recalled for me the many, many hours I used to spend on Skype – whole nights, like Nora’s first call with Hae Sung, bingeing on digital conversation as if it was some novelty candy, with lovers and with friends, sometimes a mix in between. Talking online for two to six hours at a time, or with any regular rhythm tacitly understood by only two people, can have that muddling effect. The glitchy blur on the screen is a patina of tangible presence, but it’s deeply intimate all the same. Nora gets confused, too. Her relationship with Hae Sung is not explicitly romantic, but too charged to be just friends. It’s full of palpable, unspoken longing. When she cuts it off, knowing it will be at least a year before either can actually visit the other, it’s viscerally devastating, all the more so as an end to something that was never officially started in the first place. Past Lives captures, better than most films I’ve seen, this mundane, modern yearning – the kind greased by photos and relationship updates online, of paths not taken and intimacy lost, that doesn’t so much rupture our lives as fold into the everyday. Hae Sung’s visit to New York reactivates Nora’s wistful streak but, to the film’s credit, does not veer into the overly sentimental or melodramatic. “What a good story this is,” Arthur muses in bed. “Childhood sweethearts who reconnect 20 years later and realize they were meant for each other.” She laughs, warmly, and tells him to shut up. That the alternate course in Past Lives is overlaid with diasporic longing – Hae Sung is not only a childhood friend and crush, but a vision of Nora’s life had her family stayed in Korea – heightens the stakes of their reunion but does not blunt the specificity. It’s rare to see a film so accurately capture the type of unplaceable, digitally inflected relationships most people know on some level: heavily mediated by screens, warped by distance, shored up by some level of a digital footprint. The depth of connection not commensurate with the frequency of direct contact. A level of offline feeling that’s more soaring, bruising and flickering, than the words or drama on the page. The film’s climax, one that should be witnessed and not spoiled, is a measured and searing acceptance of that murkiness. There was a different path, a different life, a singular connection whose formativeness rendered it irreplaceable and irradiating. It’s the type of relationship that’s hard to explain but beautiful to watch three adults handle as adults, and more than deserving of a film smart enough to earn its unsaid yearning. Past Lives is out in US cinemas now and in the UK on 8 September"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-22T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"Majestic regains its power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/may/22/majestic-regains-its-power-as-it-goes-back-to-its-roots","fields":{"bodyText":"Casal de Ventozela Vinho Verde, Portugal 2021 (£9.99, or £7.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) With many of its traditional competitors having departed to the great High Street in the sky, and the rest no more than shadows of their former selves, Majestic is now comfortably the UK’s biggest bricks and mortar specialist wine retailer, with more than 200 stores. Since its acquisition by the American Fortress Investment Group in 2019, the retailer, which seemed to be struggling to survive in the last of its days as part of the Naked Wines set-up, has been having a bit of a revival, helped, as so many wine retailers were, by the pandemic boom in at-home wine drinking. Tasting a selection of its current range earlier this month, it occurred to me that the current Majestic has remembered its original raison d’être: offering a much better, more varied range than the supermarkets at similar (if you buy by the mixed case) prices. Case in point: this textbook, snappy, subtly spritzy Vinho Verde dry white. Domaine des Herbauges Luminescence Brut, Loire, France NV (£15.99, or £12.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) Other good-value whites in the Majestic range include a pair of offbeat choices with at least one foot in northern Spain. Agricola Fuster Dardell Organic White 2020 (£10.99, or £8.99 as part of a mixed six) is a good example of the fleshy, stone-fruited wines made from garnacha blanca (plus, in this case, viognier) from the improving Catalan wine region, Terra Alta. Alois Lageder Terra Alpina Organic Bianco 2021 (£14.99, or £10.99 as part of a mixed six), meanwhile, is the fruit of a curious project by winemakers Clemens and Helena Lageder from Italy’s far northern Alto-Adige region: a gently rippling, floral blend of organic grapes from their own vineyards, with others sourced from Hungary and the Pyrenees. The retailer is also good at finding well-priced character-filled sparkling wine, not least Domaine des Herbauges’ Atlantic-influenced Loire fizz, with its saline brightness and refreshing clarity and zip. Emiliana Vigno Organic Carignan, Maule, Chile 2016 (£19.99, or £14.99 as part of a mixed case of six bottles, majestic.co.uk) Staying with sparkling, Majestic has two bottles from one of the best-value Champagne houses in the business: the elegantly racy, subtlest-of-pinks Devaux Oeil De Perdrix Rosé Champagne NV (£27.99, or £24.99 as part of a mixed six) and the richly savoury Devaux Blanc de Noirs Champagne NV (£29.99, or £25.99 as part of a mixed six). For bargain reds, Jean Chatelier Les Davaines Gamay 2021 is a brisk, crunchy, sappy berries-and-currants chillable summer red from the Coteaux-du-Lyonnais vineyards betwixt Beaujolais and the Rhône (£8.99, or £6.99 as part of a mixed six), while, at the other end of the flavour and textural spectrum, Polvanera Organic Primitivo 2020 from Puglia in southern Italy (£10.99, or £8.99 as part of a mixed six) is full of luscious fleshy plum and fig, dark cherry and baking spice. And finally, for a Saturday night treat, a fine example of modern Chile: Emiliana’s strikingly rich, complex, but vibrantly balanced old-vine carignan.

The new Natrium nuclear power plant will be located in Kemmerer, officials announced on Tuesday, and will replace a coal-fired plant that is set to close in 2025. “Our innovative technology will help ensure the continued production of reliable electricity while also transitioning our energy system and creating new, good-paying jobs in Wyoming,” said Chris Levesque, the CEO of TerraPower, the company behind the project that was founded by Gates about 15 years ago. Construction is set to begin in 2024. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. Kemmerer, one of four cities in the running to host the project, is home to 2,600 people and is located about 130 miles (210 km) north-east of Salt Lake City. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after world leaders met at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and chairman of TerraPower, in June announced plans for the Wyoming project along with officials from Rocky Mountain Power, Joe Biden’s administration and the state of Wyoming, which produces about 40% of the nation’s coal. “We think Natrium will be a gamechanger for the energy industry,” Gates said at the project’s launch in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Proponents of the project, which will feature a sodium-cooled fast reactor and molten salt energy storage, say it would perform better, be safer and cost less than traditional nuclear power. “Natrium will be that next improvement on safety. Importantly it won’t rely on outside sources of power, pumps and extra equipment to help the plant recover in the event of an emergency,” said Levesque, referring to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by a tsunami that knocked out emergency generators. The high heat-transfer properties of sodium will allow the Natrium plant to be air-cooled. That will enable the plant to be quickly shut down in case of an emergency, and the absence of emergency generators and pumps will save on costs, Levesque said. Others are skeptical about the benefits of sodium compared with water for cooling as in conventional nuclear plants. “The use of liquid sodium has many problems. It’s a very volatile material that can catch fire if it’s exposed to air or water,” said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists science advocacy non-profit. Countries including the US have experimented with sodium-cooled fast reactors for decades but only Russia has fielded such a reactor on a large, power-producing scale, Lyman said. “Honestly I don’t understand the motivation,” Lyman said. “There are some people who are just strong advocates for it and they’ve sort of won the day here by convincing Bill Gates that this is a good technology to pursue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/feb/03/mhaol-attachment-styles-review-irish-post-punks","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T08:30:02Z","webTitle":"M(h)aol: Attachment Styles review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/03/mhaol-attachment-styles-review-irish-post-punks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/feb/03/mhaol-attachment-styles-review-irish-post-punks","fields":{"bodyText":"Seven years after their exciting, abrasive debut single Clementine, Irish post-punks M(h)aol (pronounced male) have finally released their debut album, Attachment Styles. It’s a series of fearless moments that centre on intersectional feminism and reclamation of power, underpinned by a soundtrack of clattering drums and jagged, dissonant guitars. The result is a record that is equally vulnerable, triumphant and cathartic. “I’m just the dumb bitch that left the party with you,” vocalist Róisín Nic Ghearailt sing-speaks on spicky opener Asking for It, which unflinchingly tackles rape culture. As the track builds, the guitars become thick and gluey and Ghearailt’s voice rises to a roar: “My whole life won’t be defined by you.” It’s the heaviest track on an album where most of the songs build from bare bones, the instrumentation disjointed and primal, allowing a message of self-acceptance to dominate. Bisexual Anxiety and Femme push back against “the black and white space of monosexuality” – you can hear Ghearailt’s eyes rolling as she sings: “I should have cut my hair off when I knew I was queer / It would have made it easier on everyone here.” Closing track Period Sex provides a lusty, heavy-breathing highlight, Ghearailt savouring the refrain of “I want to make a mess” with coquettish, gleeful defiance as a kaleidoscopic guitar ebbs and flows. It’s a brilliantly confrontational ending – “If this song makes you uncomfortable you should ask yourself, why?” the band ask at the start of the song’s video – to an album that makes good on all the skill and fiery wit that M(h)aol first hinted at seven years prior."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T23:30:21Z","webTitle":"Australia’s nuclear waste is growing as battle over dump site heats up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/14/australias-nuclear-waste-is-growing-as-battle-over-dump-site-heats-up","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia is accumulating more intermediate-level nuclear waste than previously thought, a new inventory has found, as the battle over a nuclear waste dump heats up. After 40 years of different governments talking about a national nuclear waste facility, the Morrison government chose a site near the town of Kimba in South Australia. But the local Barngarla people are united against the plan, and have vowed to keep fighting to stop it happening. The federal resources minister, Madeleine King, said the waste “cannot continue to build up” and she would continue to work with the Barngarla people to protect the cultural heritage of the site and deliver economic benefit to the traditional custodians. Opponents of the site hope the new Labor government will be more likely to abandon the plan, but King said the government was committed to “progressing the facility”. Most of Australia’s nuclear waste is low-level waste (LLW), which tends to be items such as paper and gloves from laboratories that emit small amounts of radioactivity. The rest, intermediate-level waste (ILW), comes from the production of nuclear medicine – which is used, for example, in imaging, scanning and radiotherapy. It emits more radiation, breaks down more slowly and needs stricter shielding measures. The Australian Radioactive Waste Agency (Arwa) recently updated its inventory of waste, to inform the development of the Kimba facility. It found there was 2,061 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste in 2021, compared to 1,771 cubic metres in 2018. And it projects 4,377 cubic metres in the next 50 years, compared to 3,734 cubic metres projected in 2018. Arwa notes that more waste categories and holders were included in 2021, increasing the current levels of waste, and that estimates for future years were revised. Currently waste is stored in more than 100 places around the nation, but most of it is held at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (Ansto) facilities in Lucas Heights, Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Australian Conservation Foundation and others argue that Ansto should be expanded to become the national storage site. The chief executive of Arwa, Sam Usher, wrote in the report that Kimba would be used to dispose of Australia’s LLW, and to hold ILW temporarily while a permanent solution was found. “To ensure the facility has capacity to house Australia’s current and future waste holdings, Arwa has undertaken extensive work to provide an updated national inventory of radioactive waste,” he wrote. The Kimba site was announced after an Australian Electoral Commission ballot found the majority of the people in the council area were in favour. However, that ballot did not include Aboriginal people who count the area as part of their traditional lands. The Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation chair, Jason Bilney, said his people were never consulted, and they are unanimously opposed. “We were excluded,” he said. “Unanimously, we do not want it on our country. “We’ll keep fighting this.” Bilney said his people were organising a rally in Port Augusta on Saturday to remind people what is happening. He said his concern was that the site would start accepting waste from outside Australia. He also said it made more sense for the Lucas Heights facility to expand into waste storage, because the proposed Kimba site was only meant to be temporary storage for ILW anyway, with a permanent site yet to be determined. “Why would you keep kicking the can down the road?” he said. There was an ongoing court process with Barngarla people fighting for access to government documents, and King said she would not “pre-empt” the outcome of that. She said nuclear medicine, which most Australians benefit from at some point, produced radioactive waste. “We need to be responsible for the waste we create, and this includes developing permanent disposal solutions,” she said. “I will continue to work with the Barngarla people and the local community – those for and against the proposal – as we move forward. “While there is no native title on the site, the government is committed to progressing the facility in a way that protects cultural heritage and delivers economic benefit to the traditional custodians.” The site is freehold, but on the traditional lands of the Barngarla. Dave Sweeney, the ACF’s nuclear free campaigner, said there was room at Lucas Heights, and pointed to $60m awarded to Ansto in 2021 to expand its storage. “That’s approved,” he said. “It’s been through the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa).” “Arpansa has said that it’s consistent with international best practice and that means that material can be safely stored there for decades to come. So they’ve got the capacity, they’re actually growing the capacity.” The South Australian Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, supports the Barngarla people, and says he will try to influence the federal Labor government."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-16T05:31:01Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on North Korea: only China can put a stop to Kim Jong-un’s latest round of nuclear sabre-rattling | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/16/the-observer-view-on-north-korea","fields":{"bodyText":"North Korea’s scary test launch of a newly developed, solid-fuel, nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile caused a brief panic on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido last week. It also added a note of urgency to today’s meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Japan’s hot-spring resort of Karuizawa, where the Pyongyang regime’s escalating threats will be high on the agenda. Even so, the key to the North Korea conundrum may lie hundreds of miles away, in Beijing. Two questions will dominate G7 deliberations. Why is Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s dictator, deliberately ratcheting up tensions with South Korea, Japan and the US, their ultimate protector? And what can the allies do in response? Hailing the launch, the latest in more than 100 tests since last year, Kim gave an insight into his paranoid thinking. The new missile would “reinforce our nuclear counter-attack” and induce “the enemy to give up its idle strategy”, he said. Until then, he promised only “endless fear”. North Korea repeatedly condemns joint US and South Korean military exercises, which it depicts as preparation for invasion. Inter-Korean dialogue has broken down since the election last year of South Korea’s conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol. A bungled attempt at rapprochement by former US president Donald Trump came to nothing. Meanwhile, Yoon revealed recently that Washington and Seoul were stepping up nuclear war planning. Whether Kim feels genuinely threatened – North and South Korea are still technically in a state of war – or is exploiting fear of attack to better control North Korea’s people is a moot point. Yet he has many other reasons to feel insecure. His brutal regime, founded in 1948 by his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, lacks legitimacy at home and is isolated abroad. Punitive UN sanctions have stunted development. Desperation to have them lifted may be driving Kim’s aggressive actions. Recent reports that North Korea is again facing famine conditions point to hidden weakness. In January, the US-based monitoring project, 38 North, said food insecurity was at its worst since the Arduous March famines in the 1990s, which killed an estimated one million people. It is also unclear how badly the country has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, though the toll is probably far worse than officially admitted. While such matters are shrouded in secrecy, it is also suggested that Kim, whose health is often questioned, is grappling with an in-house succession crisis. Speculation surrounds the recent public appearances of his previously unseen daughter, Kim Ju-ae, who is thought to be about 10. How her suddenly elevated status sits with her auntie, Kim’s high-flying, tough-talking younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, is anyone’s guess. To his other problems, it seems, beleaguered Kim must add trouble at home. What can G7 ministers do to curb North Korean bellicosity? Not much, probably. Additional, unilateral sanctions by individual states may be the only option, since China, backed by Russia, has blocked tougher, collective action by the UN security council. And it is to China that the world should now look to apply effective pressure. Kim is no puppet, but he is uniquely beholden to Beijing. Unchecked nuclear proliferation – and nuclear war – are not in China’s interest. President Xi Jinping wants to place China at the helm of a new world order. He recently brokered a “peace deal” between long-time foes, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Yet here is another entrenched problem, much closer to home. If Xi is serious about global leadership, he should demonstrate it by ending the standoff on the Korean peninsula."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/live/2023/aug/31/idalia-hurricane-updates-latest-path-florida-carolina-georgia-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-31T22:00:29Z","webTitle":"Hurricane Idalia brings intense flooding to Carolinas as Biden declares major disaster in Florida – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/31/idalia-hurricane-updates-latest-path-florida-carolina-georgia-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/live/2023/aug/31/idalia-hurricane-updates-latest-path-florida-carolina-georgia-news","fields":{"bodyText":"It is now 6pm ET. Here is a wrap-up of the day’s key events across the southeastern states that have been hit by Hurricane Idalia: Over 1,500 federal personnel, 1.3 million meals and 1.6 million liters of water have been made available to support southeastern statres impacted by Hurricane Idalia, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced on Thursday. FEMA has also mobilized four Incident Management Assistance Teams, over 540 Urban Search and Rescue members and three Disaster Survivor Assistance Strike Teams to support states in Hurricane Idalia’s path, the agency added. Florida governor Ron DeSantis has announced that following 24 hours after Hurricane Idalia made landfall, utility linemen have already restored power to 420,000 homes in the state. DeSantis said that there were 40 rescues made, including 29 made by the National Guard and noted that wellness checks are also underway, given damage that took place during the storm. Hurricane Idalia could become the US’s costliest climate disaster of this year, as analysts estimate that the category 3 storm has already amassed $9.36bn in preliminary costs. President Joe Biden has approved an expedited major disaster declaration for Florida, the White House said on Thursday. The approval makes federal funding available to the survivors and communities of Citrus, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Levy, Suwannee and Taylor counties. Georgia has also experienced flooding and destruction from Hurricane Idalia, with the tropical storm crossing through the state on its way eastward. The storm brought winds of 90 miles per hour to Georgia on Wednesday, NPR reported, before slowing down as it crossed into the Carolinas. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration in South Carolina as Hurricane Idalia is expected to bring intense flash flooding to the region, according to a White House statement. The emergency order provides federal assistance to the state for any emergency situations arising from the hurricane, including assistance from FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as we wrap up the blog for today. Thank you for following along. Climate crisis advocacy organizations are speaking out against major oil corporations following Hurricane Idalia’s devastating destruction. “As we Floridians face the devastation of yet another massive hurricane, we know exactly who is responsible for making these countless disasters exponentially worse: the Big Oil CEOs profiting off the climate crisis and their political allies,” said Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of the CLEO Institute in Florida.” “Big Oil CEOs and politicians like Ron Desantis must be held accountable for knowingly fuelling the climate crisis that heats our oceans and strengthens deadly storms — then leading the fight to strip away resources our state could use to respond,” she added. John Paul Mejia, a Miami native and national spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement echoed similar sentiments, saying: “By turning down millions of dollars in climate investments while people suffer, Governor DeSantis has shown he’s more willing to shield Big Oil Executives from accountability than serve the people of Florida. My generation won’t forget this and we will do anything in our power to defeat politicians like him.” Similarly, Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media said: “Big Oil executives are sitting in cushy corner offices making massive profits while people in Florida, Hawaii and all over the world are losing their homes, businesses, and lives. Finally holding this industry accountable for the damage they’re causing has become a major priority for the global climate movement.” As Floridians begin recovery and repair efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia, the Guardian’s Richard Luscombe reports from Miami: Residents across the south-eastern US were beginning the clean-up from Hurricane Idalia on Thursday as Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for Florida and the weakened but still powerful tropical storm dumped torrents of rain in North Carolina and Virginia. The worst of the devastation was evident along Florida’s Gulf coast, where Idalia tore ashore on Wednesday as a category 3 hurricane with gusts of 160mph and sent a surge of seawater of up to 16ft far inland through vulnerable low-lying communities. Roofs were torn from some buildings, houses were submerged by water from the Gulf of Mexico and flash flooding, and thousands of downed trees and power lines littered a trail from Florida’s west coast to Wilmington, North Carolina. Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, toured some of the worst-hit areas on Thursday afternoon with Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and said he was “heartbroken” at what he saw. He said there was one confirmed fatality in a storm-related traffic accident.

Here are some images coming through the newswires of Hurricane Idalia’s aftermath: Hurricane Idalia could become the US’s costliest climate disaster of this year, as analysts estimate that the category 3 storm has already amassed $9.36bn in preliminary costs. The Guardian’s Richard Luscombe reports from Miami: The category 3 storm that barreled into Florida’s west coast from the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, then carved a path of destruction and flooding through Georgia and the Carolinas, has a preliminary price tag between $9.36bn, based on early estimates, from risk analysts at UBS, and $18bn-$20bn calculated by AccuWeather. It follows 15 previous “individual weather and climate disasters” recorded in the US already this year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) as unprecedented heat, wildfires, storms and floods escalate. Cumulatively, Noaa said that by the end of July, which Nasa said was Earth’s hottest month on record, the total estimated cost of the damage caused by the disasters was $39.7bn. That figure does not include the estimated $5.5bn cost to rebuild the town of Lahaina following devastating wildfires that razed the Hawaiian island of Maui this month.

Here is drone footage depicting the scale of destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia in Florida: “We’re just getting the initial assessments…that the greatest concern right now is flooding and the impact on people’s homes and businesses of that flooding,” Sherwood-Randall said. “It currently doesn’t look from aerial surveillance as if there has been widespread destruction of many buildings. Some homes have been harmed, some businesses have been harmed, but principally it looks like it’s about flooding in areas that are low-lying, where there was storm surge in the Big Bend in Florida and so that that will likely be the area in which we have to invest the most in recovery,” she added. “We have submitted to Congress a supplemental request that would replenish the Disaster Relief Fund because that fund has been depleted. We have requested $12 billion because we know that every American expects FEMA to be there if they’re experiencing a disaster,” Sherwood-Randall said. The US Army Corps of Engineers was pre-positioned before the storm to support power restoration and brought in over 30 large generators that are pre-staged if needed to support critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants, US Homeland Security advisor Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall said in a White House press briefing on Thursday. “We will be with the citizens of these impacted states as long as it takes,” Sherwood-Randall added. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is delivering a press conference to reporters on the impact of Hurricane Idalia: President Biden also just gave an update in a press conference addressing Idalia, held at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters: “We’re going to need a whole hell of a lot more money,” Biden said in reference to political pushback against FEMA’s need for more relief funds after recent natural disasters like Idalia in the US south and fires on the island of Maui in Hawaii. Biden announced he will be traveling to Florida on Saturday morning. Governor DeSantis is holding a press conference to give an update on the state of things in Florida: The Center for Disease Control issued a warning about the dangers of floodwater. “Floodwaters contain many things that may harm health. We don’t know exactly what is in floodwater at any given point in time.” The CDC cautions that floodwaters can contain downed power lines, human or livestock waste, coal ash waste with carcinogenic compounds (arsenic, chromium, mercury, and other germs), physical debris like lumber, vehicle parts, as well as stray animals like rodents and snakes. It is recommended to stay out of floodwater if possible. In the event contact was made with floodwater, “wash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible. If you don’t have soap or water, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer.” Idalia continues to drench North Carolina, and it may not be letting up any time soon. The Weather Channel senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman says: “There could be more high tide flooding this evening and tomorrow morning in parts of Virginia and in North Carolina’s Outer Banks. That’s due to the combination of high tides and north-east winds pushing water that way.” Like Georgia and the Carolinas, parts of Florida are also suffering under sweltering conditions as the state experiences widespread power outages. More than 90% of customers in Taylor, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Suwannee and Lafayette counties, including 140,000 homes and businesses, are still without power, according to powerOutage.us. Power restorations are under way, but more outages may be reported, DeSantis announced. Cleanup is happening in several counties across Georgia following destruction after Hurricane Idalia. Here’s a video from Weather Nation showing debris after Hurricane Idalia in Coffee County, Georgia: Here’s more on Hurricane Idalia’s destruction in Florida from the Guardian’s Michael Sainato. For Evelyn and Thomas Rhodes, the sign they had to flee their home was when a bed started to float off the floor. Ashley Nicole Nguyen of Pasco county, Florida has now started a GoFundMe to try to support the Rhodeses – her grandmother and uncle – who escaped the rising waters from Hurricane Idalia unharmed but have lost many of their possessions. “[They] were asleep when the storm came through around 5am. Then [Thomas] noticed that his bed started to float,” said Nguyen. The couple were taken by the fire department to their nearest friend’s house with their small dog. “But everything is completely destroyed, all of [Nicole’s] belongings, televisions, furniture, as well as everything else on that street,” said Nguyen. She said her uncle’s workplace, a nearby restaurant, was completely destroyed by flooding. Read the full article here. Georgia has also experienced flooding and destruction from Hurricane Idalia, with the tropical storm crossing through the state on its way eastward. The storm brought winds of 90 miles per hour to Georgia on Wednesday, NPR reported, before slowing down as it crossed into the Carolinas. Nearly 100,000 customers are still without power in Georgia as of Thursday morning, according to data from poweroutage.us. Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for Florida following Hurricane Idalia. The declaration provides the state with federal resources to support clean up, rescue, and more in response to the tropical storm. Here is the statement from the White House on the declaration: This morning, President Biden called Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to convey that he has signed a Major Disaster Declaration and ordered all available federal resources to help with the continued response to Tropical Storm Idalia. The President reiterated that the people of Florida have his full support as they recover from the storm. Here’s more on the DeSantis updates from the Guardian’s Richard Luscombe in Miami. Dozens of rescue missions have been “successfully completed” in Florida, the state’s Republican governor Ron DeSantis said at a morning press conference. “There’s still reports rolling in, but as of last night there were approximately 40 successful rescues made, including 29 by the Florida National Guard,” he told reporters in Tallahassee. “Our fish and wildlife officers assisted with a medical evacuation yesterday, and they are conducting high-water and welfare checks. “These efforts are continuing and they will continue until there is no longer a need.” DeSantis also praised the response of authorities in dealing with Idalia and its aftermath. “Officials in those really hard-hit counties I think did a good job.” he said. “Citizens responded very appropriately, and then to be here where you have a storm hitting close to 130mph, just under category 4, and not as of now have any reported fatalities, it’s probably something that most people would not have bet on four or five days ago.” Unofficially, three deaths are being linked to the storm, two motorists in Florida, and a man trying to clear a felled tree in Georgia. DeSantis will tour the worst-affected areas today with Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). “I’m here to see first-hand the impacts that the communities have had so we can determine what level of assistance, and what other programs we’ll need to bring in to help support those people that were in the storm’s path, and help them on the road to recovery,” Criswell told the press conference. “We are going to make sure that we always have the resources here from the federal family to support the current efforts [and] ongoing recovery efforts that may be needed in these communities.” Florida governor Ron DeSantis gave an update Thursday morning about Hurricane Idalia, noting that there has been “significant damage” in Florida’s Big Bend community. DeSantis said that there were 40 rescues made, including 29 made by the National Guard. DeSantis noted that wellness checks are also underway, given damage that took place during the storm. DeSantis added that local agencies are also working on debris removal, including addressing fallen trees on Florida’s roadways. “There’s a massive amount of debris,” said DeSantis on hurricane debris he witnessed, noting that trees in the area have largely been knocked down. “I saw roofs torn off of businesses. We saw other types of hurricane damage.” Here are images displaying some of the damage and destruction coming out of Florida from Hurricane Idalia. Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration in South Carolina as Hurricane Idalia is expected to bring intense flash flooding to the region, according to a White House statement. The emergency order provides federal assistance to the state for any emergency situations arising from the hurricane, including assistance from Fema and the Department of Homeland Security, NBC reported. Hurricane Idalia will likely move offshore on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. The tropical storm is expected to move east of North Carolina on Thursday afternoon, but flooding in the state is still possible. Idalia is currently bringing winds of 35 to 40 miles per hour to the state’s eastern Sandhills and Coastal Plain region, though winds are expected to decrease by the afternoon and evening. Floridians are assessing damage caused by Hurricane Idalia as the deadly storm rolls through the Carolinas. The category 3 storm caused extensive damage along the state’s coast, flooding streets, homes and vehicles. Power lines in Florida and Georgia were also impacted by the storm, with nearly 500,000 customers losing power on Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. Idalia brought intense flooding to the Carolinas and is expected to bring heavy rain to parts of North Carolina on Thursday, forecasters predicted. The National Hurricane Center predicted that portions of eastern North Carolina could experience “heavy rainfall and life-threatening flash flooding”, according to an 8am ET (12pm GMT) update. More than 50,000 customers in the Carolinas are without power, as of 8.15am ET (12.15pm GMT)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-03T18:40:25Z","webTitle":"Nuclear attack on US or allies would end Kim regime, says defense secretary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/north-korea-nuclear-attack-us-kim-regime-lloyd-austin","fields":{"bodyText":"The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Thursday any nuclear attack on the US or its allies by North Korea would “result in the end of the Kim regime”. Kim Jong-un’s government in Pyongyang has in recent days mounted a number of missile tests. The South Korean military said a test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Thursday may have ended in failure. Japan called the launch “outrageous and absolutely intolerable”. According to a joint communique released by the US Department of Defense, during his meeting with the South Korean defense minister, Lee Jong-sup, Austin said: “Any nuclear attack against the United States or its allies and partners, including the use of non-strategic nuclear weapons, is unacceptable and will result in the end of the Kim regime.” Similar language was included in the US National Defense Strategy, which was released last week. That document said, in part: “Our strategy for North Korea recognises the threat posed by its nuclear, chemical, missile and conventional capabilities, and in particular the need to make clear to the Kim regime the dire consequences should it use nuclear weapons … there is no scenario in which the Kim regime could employ nuclear weapons and survive.” Austin, a retired US army general and the first African American secretary of defense, spoke to reporters at the Pentagon alongside Lee. “Minister Lee and I had an outstanding discussion today,” Austin said. “We talked about how the DPRK [North Korea] has continued provocations and destabilising actions, and at this time of heightened tension, our alliance is ironclad. “The United States remains fully committed to the defense [of South Korea]. Our extended deterrence commitment is firm and includes a full range of our nuclear and conventional and missile defense capabilities.” He said the two countries planned to return to large-scale military exercises on the peninsula. The Biden administration has taken such steps after four years in which Donald Trump placed unprecedented stress on relations between Seoul and Washington, saying he wanted South Korea to pay for US military assistance in place since the Korean war of 1950-53. Trump, whose cavalier treatment of matters of nuclear policy has been extensively reported, met repeatedly with Kim, staging high-profile summits that produced little tangible benefit. At the Pentagon, Austin said the US was “committed to building on on [the Biden administration’s] efforts to strengthen integrated deterrence and to ensure that this alliance continues to bolster security and stability on the Korean peninsula and throughout the Indo-Pacific”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-23T22:03:01Z","webTitle":"‘Once in a generation’ freeze for Christmas as bomb cyclone hits US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/23/us-weather-bomb-cyclone-us-christmas-latest","fields":{"bodyText":"The winter storm that forecasters dubbed Elliott intensified into a bomb cyclone near the Great Lakes on Friday, bringing high winds and blizzard conditions from the Northern Plains to western and upstate New York, along with life-threatening flooding, flash-freezing and travel chaos as it went. Airline cancellations topped 5,700 flights, with tens of thousands of holiday travellers grounded in airports with limited expectations of making further progress. Travel on the roads was disrupted due snowy weather or crashes and authorities in parts of Indiana, Michigan, New York and Ohio urged motorists to avoid nonessential travel. Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN the US aviation system “is operating under enormous strain”. About 10% of US flights were canceled on Thursday, Buttigieg said. The storm, estimated to be 2,000 miles wide, has produced driving snow and plummeting temperatures, knocking out power from Texas to Maine. Officials ordered cars off the roads as US forecasters warned of “potentially crippling impacts across central and eastern” parts of the country. The arrival of the arctic blast produced widespread disruption to utilities, with more than 1.5m households estimated to be without power. At the White House, after Joe Biden was briefed on Elliott, the president said: “This is not like a snow day when you were a kid. This is serious stuff.” About 200 million people in the 48 contiguous states were under extreme weather alerts, said forecaster Bob Oravec of the National Weather Service (NWS). An advisory warned that the powerful cold front would engulf the eastern US tonight “with widespread dangerous cold expected to continue across much of the eastern two-thirds of the US into the holiday weekend”. “Rapid temperature drops, sometimes 50 or more degrees colder than the previous day,” Oravec told the Associated Press. “It’s a pretty powerful system.” The precipitous drop in temperatures was accompanied by high winds. A 79-mph gust was recorded in downtown Buffalo, New York, where snow fall produced a rare “zero visibilty” observation at the airport. “There are some people in Buffalo saying this is one of the worst storms they’ve ever seen,” said the city’s mayor, Byron W Brown. “Buffalo is used to dealing with normal snowfall. We are dealing with it fine, but certainly it is a very challenging storm”. In Ohio, what was described as a “mass casualty incident” was declared on Interstate 75 after more than 100 vehicles piled up in the conditions. The police department in Memphis, Tennessee, said a man found on Union Avenue on Friday had died from exposure to the frosty weather. Forecasters had said the scale of the weather pattern was nearly unprecedented in its scope, exposing than 200 million people – about 60% of the US population – to some sort of winter advisory or warning. The weather service’s map “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” forecasters said. Tens of thousands of homes have been left without power, and governors in at least 13 states have drawn up emergency response plans, including National Guard deployments, for the holiday weekend, with heavy snow and ice creating treacherous road conditions and some drivers stranded. Temperatures in Colorado on Thursday dipped to a record-breaking low of -9F (-22.7C) from 42F (5.5C), while Cheyenne, Wyoming, recorded its greatest one-hour temperature drop, plunging from 43F to 3F in the space of 30 minutes. The NWS said temperatures of -50F to -70F were possible over the weekend in some parts of the US, warning that even in big metropolitan areas such as Des Moines, Iowa, frostbite could become a significant danger. Ahead of one of the busiest travel periods of the year, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said more than 112 million people planned to travel 50 miles (80 km) or more from home between 23 December and 2 January. Even though fleets of snow plows and salt trucks have been deployed across the US, driving was extremely dangerous and even deadly. Kansas City police spokesperson Donna Drake said a minivan driver died Thursday after losing control on icy streets and overturning into a creek. In Kentucky three people died on the roads, Governor Andy Beshear announced on Friday morning. Beshear added that the state’s National Guard was delivering blankets to the Kentucky state police to distribute to stranded drivers on Interstate 71 and escorting some to shelters. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul , declared an emergency, saying the threat of flooding and ice jams blocking rivers would “wreak a lot of havoc in our community”. The Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, called it “a unique and dangerous situation”. In Georgia, where temperatures in the north were forecast to hit 10F (-12C), with subzero wind chills, the governor Brian Kemp said the state was “expecting weather we haven’t seen in a decade or more”. More than half of the so-called lower 48 states, from Washington state to Florida, are under winter weather alerts, including wind chill advisories affecting about 135 million people, said Ashton Robinson Cook of the weather service’s prediction centre. The NWS has described the storm as “once in a generation” weather event, saying more than 100 daily cold temperature records could be equalled or broken over the coming days. Florida is projected to experience its coldest Christmas in 30 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T19:25:58Z","webTitle":"Wanted: a new energy contract for renewables and nuclear projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak, when he was still chancellor and was coming round to the idea of a windfall tax, noticed a key point about today’s energy market. Not all the corporate winners in the UK from soaraway wholesale gas prices are producing hydrocarbons in the North Sea. Some are generating power from nuclear power stations, solar projects, windfarms and biomass and are enjoying the same high wholesale prices. Those generators are benefiting from old-style contracts based on “renewables obligation certificates” (ROCs) and suchlike, rather than contracts-for-difference (CfD) arrangements that have been the main way of incentivising capacity in recent years. Under CfDs, excess revenues over the agreed “strike” price flow to the Treasury. That is not the case with ROCs, thus some spectacular improvements in corporate fortunes; the share price of biomass-heavy Drax is up two-thirds in the past 12 months, for instance. In the event, Sunak confined his “energy profits levy” to oil and gas producers. It seems the Treasury was deterred by the complexities in the generation market, which was understandable up to a point. Much of the power is sold under long-term contracts, rather than at “spot” prices, and intermediaries sub-divide output many times. It is hard to get a firm grasp on where, precisely, windfall gains arise. Here, though, is a proposal that cuts through some of the complexity. Encourage those generators with juicy old-style contracts to enter an auction to switch themselves on to CfD arrangements, suggests the consultancy Cornwall Insight. If they all did so, and if the price of power came out at £162 per megawatt hour – still high by historical standards but a lot less than the current month-ahead price of £435 – the resulting savings could be enormous. About £44.4bn over six months, it calculates (and the UK Energy Research Centre has been pushing the idea for months). By way of incentive to companies to sign up, Cornwall says the new contracts could extend beyond the span of the old ones. In effect, the generators would get more certainty (and still a very nice price) over revenues in two or three years’ time in exchange for selling at sub-market lower prices today. Arm-twisting would also be in order, one could add: current returns are way beyond the original financiers’ wildest dreams. At one level, Cornwall’s proposed reform is a technical tweak, but it gets to the heart of an infuriating aspect of the current electricity market set-up: the fact that wholesale gas prices dictate all power prices, thereby creating today’s bonanza profits for some renewable and nuclear projects whose fixed costs have barely changed. Sunak had a crack at the problem and didn’t get far. If the potential gain over the winter could really be £44.4bn, ministers should take another look urgently. Letting HBOS bosses off hook a second time was a cop out Last Friday may already feel like ancient history but let’s not forget the financial regulators’ timid verdict on events from much longer ago. The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority told us at the end of last week that their six-year investigation result in no sanction being imposed on the banking bosses who steered HBOS on to the rocks in 2008. Younger readers may need to be reminded that the catastrophe at HBOS was as bad as the one at the Royal Bank of Scotland. HBOS was meant to have a simple business model – one that didn’t rely on the racy world of investment banking – but managed to wreck itself via old-fashioned reckless lending. The bank was bailed out with £20bn of public money as it was shoved into the arms of its foolish rescuer, Lloyds TSB. The formal investigation in 2015 was scathing about dim-witted regulators at the old Financial Services Authority, but was clear on this point: “Ultimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with its board.” That was why the PRA and the FCA were prodded by the Treasury select committee into re-examining the decision not to look at sanctions against senior HBOS managers – assumed to mean the two HBOS chief executives of the era, James Crosby and Andy Hornby, plus a handful of others. Now, for the second time, the result is “no further action”. It is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. Yes, the rules around personal “culpability” were different in the old days. And, yes, Crosby and Hornby become unemployable for practical purposes in senior roles within the financial services industry (the latter these days is chief executive at the owner of Wagamama). But, come on, blaming the board as a collective while sparing individuals from censure is a cop-out. Public faith in the regulatory system has just fallen another notch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/30/gabon-coup-military-takeover-gabonese-election-disputed","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-30T15:57:25Z","webTitle":"Gabon military officers declare coup after Ali Bongo wins disputed election","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/30/gabon-coup-military-takeover-gabonese-election-disputed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/30/gabon-coup-military-takeover-gabonese-election-disputed","fields":{"bodyText":"Military officers in Gabon say they have taken power and put the president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, under house arrest, as the country becomes the latest in Africa to suffer an attempted coup, only weeks after mutinous troops seized power in Niger. A group of military personnel appeared on state television to announce they were seizing power to overturn the results of a presidential election, seeking to remove a president whose family has held power for nearly 56 years. The officers introduced themselves as members of the Committee of Transition and the Restoration of Institutions. If successful, the coup would be the eighth in west and central Africa since 2020. The most recent one, in Niger, was in July, while the military has also seized power in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Chad. In a video apparently from detention in his residence, Bongo Ondimba called on people to “make noise” to support him. Crowds instead took to the streets of the capital and sang the national anthem to celebrate the coup attempt against a dynasty accused of getting rich on the country’s resource wealth while many of its citizens struggle to scrape by. The officers said they represented all Gabonese security and defence forces and announced the election results were cancelled, all borders were closed until further notice and state institutions dissolved. “Today the country is undergoing a severe institutional, political, economic, and social crisis,” the officers said in a statement, saying the 26 August election lacked transparency and credibility. “In the name of the Gabonese people … we have decided to defend the peace by putting an end to the current regime.” A Gabon army officer, Brice Oligui Nguema, told French newspaper Le Monde that generals would meet on Wednesday to decide who would lead a transition. The coup attempt came hours after Bongo, 64, was declared winner of an election marred by fears of violence. He was last seen in public casting his vote on Saturday. Gabon is a member of the Opec oil cartel, with a production of 181,000 barrels of crude a day, making it the eighth-largest producer of oil in sub-Saharan Africa. It is home to more than 2 million people, and is slightly smaller than the US state of Colorado. Unlike Niger and two other west African countries run by military juntas, Gabon has not been afflicted by jihadi violence and had been seen as relatively stable. But nearly 40% of Gabonese aged 15-24 were out of work in 2020, according to the World Bank. The president of Nigeria, Bola Tinubu, who is also chair of the West African regional bloc Ecowas that has threatened to intervene military in Niger to restore constitutional order, was said by a spokesman to be “watching developments in Gabon very closely with deep concern for the country’s socio-political stability and the seeming autocratic contagion apparently spreading across different regions of our beloved continent.” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the the US was “following this very, very closely.” China called for a peaceful resolution and Russia said it hoped for a swift return to stability. The political demise of Bongo fits a pattern of coups in French-speaking Africa in recent years. The French-educated Bongo met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris in late June and shared photos of them shaking hands. The French prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, said France, Gabon’s former colonial ruler, was following the situation closely. France has around 400 soldiers permanently deployed in the country for training and military support, including at a base in the capital, and has extensive economic ties to the country in the mining and oil sectors. Before Wednesday’s dramatic announcement, Bongo’s spell in office was marked by disputed elections and a stroke that spurred rumours about his fitness for office and fuelled a minor attempted coup. Niger and other Sahel countries have been fighting Islamist insurgencies that have eroded faith in democratic governments. Gabon, which lies further south on the Atlantic coast, is not facing the same challenges, but a coup would suggest another sign of democratic backsliding in a volatile region. Viviane Mbou, a shopkeeper, offered the soldiers juice, which they declined. And Jordy Dikaba, a young man walking with his friends on a street lined with armoured policemen, said: “Long live our army.” The French mining company Eramet said it was ceasing all operations in Gabon, and was implementing procedures to ensure the safety of its staff and facilities. The company’s subsidiaries in Gabon operate the world’s largest manganese mine and a rail transport company. The private intelligence firm Ambrey said all operations at Gabon’s main port in Libreville had been halted, with authorities refusing to grant permission for vessels to leave. One morning flight at Libreville’s Léon-Mba international airport had already been delayed early on Wednesday morning. A man who answered a number listed for the airport told Associated Press that flights were cancelled on Wednesday. The coup attempt came about a month after mutinous soldiers in Niger seized power from the democratically elected government, and is the latest in a series of coups that have challenged governments with ties to France. Bongo, in his annual Independence Day speech on 17 August, said: “While our continent has been shaken in recent weeks by violent crises, rest assured that I will never allow you and our country, Gabon, to be hostages to attempts at destabilisation. Never.” In his speech, Bongo acknowledged the widespread frustration over rising costs of living, and listed measures his government was taking to contain fuel prices, make education more affordable, and stabilise the price of baguettes. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, asked about Gabon on Wednesday, said European ministers would discuss the situation this week. “If this is confirmed, it’s another military coup, which increases instability in the whole region,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jul/19/nick-clegg-defends-release-open-source-ai-model-meta-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-19T11:52:14Z","webTitle":"Nick Clegg defends release of open-source AI model by Meta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/19/nick-clegg-defends-release-open-source-ai-model-meta-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jul/19/nick-clegg-defends-release-open-source-ai-model-meta-facebook","fields":{"bodyText":"Nick Clegg has defended the release of an open-source artificial intelligence model by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, as he claimed that “hype” about AI’s dangers was running ahead of the technology’s development. The president of global affairs at Meta and former UK deputy prime minister spoke on Wednesday after the company said it was opening access to its new large language model (LLM), Llama 2, which will be free for research and commercial use. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data and underpin generative AI products such as the ChatGPT chatbot. Some experts have warned that making AI models open source – or freely available to use and adapt for unique purposes – could lead to the technology being used for malicious purposes. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Clegg said: “My view is that the hype has somewhat run ahead of the technology. I think a lot of the existential warnings relate to models that don’t currently exist, so-called super-intelligent, super-powerful AI models – the vision where AI develops an autonomy and agency on its own, where it can think for itself and reproduce itself. “The models that we’re open-sourcing are far, far, far short of that. In fact, in many ways they’re quite stupid.” However, one AI expert compared Meta’s open-source move to handing over the secrets to making a nuclear weapon. Dame Wendy Hall, regius professor of computer science at the University of Southampton, said there were questions over whether the tech industry could be trusted to self-regulate LLMs, with the problem looming even larger for open-source models. “It’s a bit like giving people a template to build a nuclear bomb,” she told Today. Clegg said Meta had 350 people “stress-testing” its models over several months to check for any potential problems, and Llama 2 was safer than any other open-source large language models available. He said “it’s not as if we’re at a T-junction” where companies can “choose to open source or not”, adding: “Models are being open-sourced all the time already.” While Clegg said he strongly believed AI should be regulated, he added that that “doesn’t mean that every single AI model should be open-sourced”, adding that Meta would not be releasing a voice-generating model, called Voicebox, to the public. Referring to Llama 2, Clegg said the “wisdom of crowds” would make AI models safer rather than leaving them in the “clammy hands” of technology multinationals. “Crucially, you take it out of the … clammy hands of the big tech companies, which are currently the only companies that have either the computing power or the vast reservoirs of data to build these models in the first place,” he said. In May, Google was warned by one of its engineers that it could be beaten in the AI race by commonly available open-source technology. “The uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is [ChatGPT developer] OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch,” the engineer wrote, referring to open-source AI."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/27/emmanuel-macron-vanuata-visit-pacific-imperialism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-27T03:21:33Z","webTitle":"Emmanuel Macron denounces ‘new imperialism’ in Pacific on historic visit to Vanuatu","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/emmanuel-macron-vanuata-visit-pacific-imperialism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/27/emmanuel-macron-vanuata-visit-pacific-imperialism","fields":{"bodyText":"French president Emmanuel Macron has denounced “new imperialism” in the Pacific during a landmark visit to the region, warning of a threat to the sovereignty of smaller states. “There is in the Indo-Pacific and particularly in Oceania new imperialism appearing, and a power logic that is threatening the sovereignty of several states – the smallest, often the most fragile,” he said in Vanuatu on Thursday. His comments came as US secretary of defense Lloyd Austin told reporters in Papua New Guinea that Washington was not seeking a permanent base in the Pacific Islands nation under a new defence agreement with Port Moresby. Macron – on the first visit by a sitting French leader to an independent Pacific state – sought to underscore France’s importance in a region over which China and the US are competing for military, economic and diplomatic influence. “Our Indo-Pacific strategy is above all to defend through partnerships the independence and sovereignty of all states in the region that are ready to work with us,” Macron said. France has 1.6 million citizens in the Asia-Pacific across seven overseas territories, including New Caledonia and French Polynesia, and an exclusive economic zone spanning nine million square kilometres (3.5m square miles). As the US and its allies seek to counter China’s growing sway in the region, France offered an “alternative”, a presidential adviser said, with plans for expanded aid and development to confront natural catastrophes. Macron last year relaunched France’s Indo-Pacific approach in the aftermath of a bitter row over a cancelled submarine contract with Australia, casting France as a balancing power in a region dominated by the tussle between China and the US. He is on a five-day visit to the region, which has also included a stop in New Caledonia and will continue in Papua New Guinea (PNG). It is the first time a French president has travelled to independent countries in the Pacific region, and not only French overseas territories. France has sovereignty over three territories in the Pacific: New Caledonia, French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna. New Caledonians rejected independence in a third referendum on the subject in December 2021, although the vote was boycotted by pro-independence movements largely backed by the indigenous Kanak population. While Macron was in Vanuatu, US defense secretary Austin was meeting PNG’s prime minister, James Marape, to discuss their countries’ deepening defence ties. “I just want to be clear, we are not seeking a permanent base in PNG,” he said afterwards. PNG and the US signed a defence cooperation agreement in May that sets a framework for the US to refurbish PNG ports and airports for military and civilian use. The text of the agreement shows that it allows the staging of US forces and equipment in PNG, and covers the Lombrum naval base which is being developed by Australia and the US. Austin said the two nations were deepening an existing defence relationship, and would modernise PNG’s defence force and boost interoperability. “Our goal is to make sure we strengthen PNG’s ability to defend itself and protect its interest,” he added. The US has been seeking to deter Pacific island nations from forming security ties with China, a rising concern amid tension over Taiwan, and after Beijing signed a security pact with Solomon Islands. Marape on Thursday said the defence cooperation with the US would build up PNG’s capability, and was “not for a war joint preparation”.

Never mind that it is essentially a stopover on the way to the Nato summit in Vilnius and being squeezed between tea with King Charles at Windsor Castle and a speech on climate finance. The two men are not just 37 years apart in age, but increasingly a long way apart on how to handle Ukraine. The disagreements will be kept from the public eye, and the hope is that the meeting can narrow the differences. The US disapproves if the junior partner goes public on any disagreement, or is perceived to be trying to bounce Washington into action. Pushiness, some say, was the undoing of the Nato secretary generalship ambitions of Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, after he tried to force the pace on arms supplies. Similarly, the watchword of Nato, built on consensus, is unity. But it is self-evident that the two countries lean towards different positions on the war in Ukraine, and its aftermath. At issue are the conditions set for the path for Ukraine’s future membership of Nato, and the security guarantees that Volodymyr Zelenskiy should be provided by an ad hoc alliance of states in the interim. And behind that lie questions about escalation and Nato’s future relationship with Russia. At one extreme lies a nervous Germany and at the other, impatient Baltic States and Poland. These disagreements are matched by shorter-term conflicts over the restrictions the US continues to place on arms deliveries, delays particularly in F-16s that in British eyes have left the Ukrainian counteroffensive struggling across miles of heavily mined land in a way probably not seen since the Iran-Iraq war. By contrast, the open disagreement over the US decision on Friday to supply cluster munitions to fill an ammunition gap is less important. Britain, as a signatory to the cluster munitions convention, can hardly approve of the US decision, but neither is Sunak in a position to try to block a request that has come from Ukraine itself. Going into a summit of this gravitas, the US and the UK cannot afford to be at loggerheads, so the next 48 hours will be a test of Sunak’s persuasive powers. He does not naturally “speak for Ukraine” with the emotional simplicity of Boris Johnson, who said all the west’s “dodging and weaving” about Nato membership for Ukraine “had ended only in slaughter”. So it will be a challenge to see if his quiet rationality can persuade Biden that Ukraine deserves to be told precisely how and broadly when it can get through the supposedly open door to Nato membership. All sides agree that Ukraine cannot join in the midst of a war, since that would commit Nato states to fighting Russia. The US and UK also agree that the Nato-Ukraine commission founded in 1997 should be upgraded to a Nato-Ukraine council. The change may give Ukraine some extra leverage in the bureaucracy of Nato. What the UK wants is something tangible to show to Ukraine that it is not being offered the same pledges of future membership made 15 years ago at a Nato summit in Bucharest. UK ministers – notably the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, at the London Ukraine Recovery conference – have been very clear that as a signal of this intent, Ukraine should not need to fulfil a Membership Action Plan. “I think the UK’s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to Sweden and Finland didn’t require that, and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield,” Cleverly said. “I think all Nato allies recognise that.” But Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, at a briefing on Friday parried the issue, saying it was still “under active discussion”. In an interview with CNN, Biden unsurprisingly ruled out Nato membership for Ukraine in the middle of a war, but made membership conditional on more than the war’s end. “We have to lay out a rational path for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into Nato,” Biden said. “It is a process that takes time to meet all the qualifications from democratisation to a whole range of other issues.” It sounded as if he was sceptical about Ukraine’s chances of a shortcut to Nato membership. By contrast, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, told the Guardian on 28 June that Ukraine had already met the three pre-conditions: interoperability with Nato forces, a transparent procurement system, and civilian control of the military. With Germany backing US caution, Sunak has to make a call on how much political capital to expend persuading Biden that a post-war largely unconditional offer of membership would not prolong the war or provoke Putin. Torn between the UK’s dependence on the US and the UK’s natural allies in the Baltics and Poland, Sunak will need to show a new degree of diplomatic sinuousness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-21T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: Chuck D’s fantastic series about the world-changing power of hip hop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jan/21/tv-tonight-chuck-ds-fantastic-series-about-the-world-changing-power-of-hip-hop","fields":{"bodyText":"Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World Saturday, 9pm, BBC Two Public Enemy’s Chuck D leads this fantastic four-part documentary telling the history of hip-hop.

Aged 18 years and 128 days, Ahmed had just broken the record held by Australia’s Pat Cummins as the youngest men’s Test cricketer to claim a five-wicket haul on debut. Better still, 48 hours on from hailing the best day of his life, he had set his team on course for what would be a first series clean sweep in Pakistan. Ahmed’s magical figures of five for 48 from 14.5 overs – secured aged 68 days younger than Cummins’s stunning arrival in Johannesburg 11 years ago – led to Pakistan being rolled for 216 all out, setting England a target of 167 in seven sessions. The tourists wanted it done in one, raiding a frankly bewildering 112 for two from 17 overs in the gloaming, leaving only 55 more to whittle off on day four. Amid this bid for glory before sunset Ahmed even emerged as the first official “nighthawk” of the new era at No 3 – apologies, Stuart Broad – and carted his first ball off Abrar Ahmed down the ground for four. A second, wristier boundary followed before he was bowled for 10. No matter. Through Zak Crawley’s run-a-ball 41 and Ben Duckett’s unbeaten 38-ball 50, history was within touching distance. As Ahmed scribbled his numbers in gold pen on the honours board after stumps, scarcely able to compute them as he did so, it was another example of the Midas touch that has prevailed since Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum became captain and head coach respectively. A talent such as Ahmed, performing the hardest job in cricket, could scarcely have wished for two better leaders under whom to start. Despite two wickets on day one Stokes held Ahmed back until well into the afternoon. A three-wicket burst from Jack Leach first thing had made way for nearly three hours of steadfast resistance from Saud Shakeel and Babar Azam and at 164 for three – a lead of 114 runs – Pakistan were looking ominous. Stokes tried to barge through the door with an eight-over spell of heft in the heat and grew agitated with it, his shy at the stumps allowing Babar to bring up a typically glossy half-century via overthrows. But in the space of 17 deliveries Ahmed picked the lock instead, prising out both set men, plus Mohammad Rizwan, to make it 177 for six and expose Pakistan’s rather brittle lower order. Babar’s demise during Ahmed’s second over was galling for a captain surely hearing the whispers about his future, rocking back and slapping a long-hop to Ollie Pope at midwicket on 54. But there was little doubt about the quality of the follow-up, Ahmed finding the edge of Rizwan’s defensive push on seven with a dipping, downright purring leg-break that Ben Foakes neatly pouched. The googly is Ahmed’s most potent weapon through its greater bounce and once the latest of these had removed Shakeel for 53 via a top-edged sweep, the hosts had that sinking feeling once more. Joe Root soon had the largely anonymous Faheem Ashraf caught at slip after tea off a loose drive, while Mark Wood simply beat Nauman Ali for pace to end a gutsier 15 lbw. All that was left was for Ahmed to shut down the innings, Mohammad Wasim Jr undone slogging another wrong’un and Agha Salman sweeping to short fine leg. With his Pakistan-born father, Naeem, welling up in the stands, Ahmed’s immediate sajdah in celebration was truly special. Not for the first time Leach had seen the headlines pilfered by the young debutant and yet his contribution – figures of three for 72 from 26 overs – was hugely significant. Leach had set things in motion in the morning, claiming the first of three victims in six balls when Shan Masood attempted a reverse sweep on 24 and under-edged on to leg stump. Out strode Azhar Ali for his final Test innings before retirement. The 37-year-old is a player whose service to Pakistan has been immense, not just through 7,000-plus Test runs and 19 centuries but as one of the central pillars of the team that spent 10 years in exile yet rose to No 1 in the rankings in 2016. What followed, however, with his wife and children watching on in the sparse stands, was heartbreaking. Attempting to dance down to Leach’s fourth ball, Azhar instead yorked himself as a dipping delivery broke back on to the stumps. As England offered handshakes, and teammates formed a guard of honour at the boundary’s edge, Azhar wiped a tear from his eye. Bowled for a duck was no way to sign off, even if consolation could perhaps be found through Don Bradman’s famous exit stage left. In the next over Leach struck again, Abdullah Shafique out lbw in identical fashion to the first innings to leave the hosts 54 for three – a lead of just four. But though Shakeel survived the hat-trick ball amid a cage of vultures, and formed one half of a battling 110-run fightback alongside Babar, there was simply no escaping the sense of destiny that appears to be following Ahmed and this England team."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T09:26:36Z","webTitle":"Putin threatens nuclear retaliation in escalation of Ukraine war | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/first-thing-putin-threatens-nuclear-retaliation-in-escalation-of-ukraine-war","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing. The president also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying Russia had “lots of weapons” to reply to what he called western threats on its territory and added that he was not bluffing. In a highly anticipated televised address, Putin said the “partial mobilisation” was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west that “wants to destroy our country” and claimed the west had tried to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”. “Military service will apply only to citizens who are currently in the reserve, especially those who have served in the armed forces, have certain military professions and relevant experience,” he said. What has happened since? Shortly after Putin’s announcement, the country’s defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, said 300,000 Russians would be called up as part of the mobilisation, which would apply to “those with previous military experience”. What has sparked this? The Russian leader’s televised address to the country came a day after Russian-controlled regions in Ukraine announced plans to hold votes on becoming part of Russia. This could set the stage for Moscow to escalate the war after Ukrainian successes. Writer E Jean Carroll to file new lawsuit after accusing Trump of rape E Jean Carroll, the writer who accused Donald Trump of raping her more than two decades ago, plans to file a new lawsuit against the former US president. In a letter made public on Tuesday, a lawyer for former Elle magazine columnist said she planned to sue Trump for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress under New York state’s Adult Survivors Act. That law, recently signed by the governor, Kathy Hochul, gives adult accusers a one-year window to bring civil claims over alleged sexual misconduct regardless of how long ago it occurred. Trump has denied raping Carroll and accused her of concocting the claim to sell her book. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said her client planned to sue Trump on 24 November, when the state law would take effect, and that the claims and Carroll’s existing defamation case against Trump could be tried together in February 2023. What does Carroll say happened? Carroll has accused Trump of raping her in the dressing room of the Manhattan department store Bergdorf Goodman in the 1990s. She sued him in 2019 while he was serving his presidency, saying he slandered her by denying the allegation. What has Trump said about it? The former president said she was “totally lying” and was “not my type”, among other remarks. Revealed: the ‘shocking’ levels of toxic lead in Chicago tap water One in 20 tap water tests performed for thousands of Chicago residents found lead, a neurotoxin, at or above US government limits, according to a Guardian analysis of City of Chicago data. One-third had more lead than is permitted in bottled water. This means that of the 24,000 tests, approximately 1,000 homes had lead exceeding federal standards. Experts and locals say these results raise broader concerns because there are an estimated 400,000 lead pipes supplying water to homes in the city, and the vast majority were not tested as part of the program. Moreover, they say the city is not moving fast enough to eliminate the potential danger. The Guardian worked with the water engineer Elin Betanzo – who helped uncover the Flint water crisis that resulted in many, mostly Black residents being poisoned by lead in the Michigan city – to review the results of water tests conducted for Chicago residents between 2016 and 2021. Chicago authorities have not released an analysis of the results. What impact can lead have on people’s health? Once in the blood, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect the nervous system. It has been linked to lower IQ levels, behavioral disorders and worsening performance in reading and math. In adults, low levels of lead are associated with kidney problems and increasing blood pressure, which can contribute to a host of cardiac effects. Minnesota schemers allegedly swindle $250m in largest pandemic fraud Forty-seven people have been charged in what US authorities say is the largest case yet of “pandemic fraud”, accusing the defendants of a “brazen” scheme to swindle millions from a program intended for low-income children and using it to “enrich themselves”. Those charged are accused of creating companies that claimed to providing food to tens of thousands of children across Minnesota, then sought reimbursement for those meals through the US Department of Agriculture’s food nutrition programs. Prosecutors say few meals were served, and the defendants used the money to buy luxury cars, property and jewelry. Authorities say a total of $250m was stolen from the federal program. “This $250m is the floor,” Andrew Luger, the US attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference. How did they carry out the fraud? Luger said the government was billed for more than 125m fake meals, with some defendants making up names for children by using an online random name generator. Many of the companies that claimed to be serving food were sponsored by a non-profit called Feeding Our Future, which submitted the companies’ claims for reimbursement.

Compared with ants, that is a mediocre milestone. Researchers have made the most thorough assessment to date of the global population of ants and the estimated total is a mind-blowing 20 quadrillion of them, or approximately 2.5 million for every human. It should come as little surprise considering how ubiquitous these busy and social insects are, and the fact they have thrived since the age of dinosaurs, with the oldest-known ant fossil dating back about 100m years to the Cretaceous period.

Labour candidate sees beating Boris Johnson as key to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/12/danny-beales-interview-labour-candidate-boris-johnson-seat-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jan/12/danny-beales-interview-labour-candidate-boris-johnson-seat-uxbridge-and-south-ruislip","fields":{"bodyText":"Labour’s candidate to take on Boris Johnson as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip says the party may have to win the seat for the first time to gain power at the next election. Danny Beales, 34, a councillor and charity worker who grew up in the area, admits he will have to work “exceptionally hard” to overturn Johnson’s 7,210 majority. Since being selected as candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Beales is convinced Labour can gain from local exasperation at the checkered record of the former prime minister. “I think it will be a bellwether seat – it is exactly the sort of seat Labour needs to win to deliver a Labour government. The issues in Uxbridge and South Ruislip are also the key issues nationally – on the doorstep people say they feel poorer.” Labour’s hopes of toppling the then prime minister at the 2019 general election proved wildly overoptimistic, as Johnson increased his majority by more than 2,000 votes in an outer London constituency that has been Tory since it was formed in 2010. But according to analysis in the New Statesman by the co-founder of the polling group Britain Elects, the seat is now winnable for Labour. Beales says: “I always take polls with a pinch of salt, but it’s good motivation for activists to feel we should really be going for the win.” At 34, he is too young to remember much about Labour’s landslide victory in the 1997 general election, but says his family and friends talk about the “Michael Portillo moment” when the then defence secretary lost to Labour’s Stephen Twigg in another outer London constituency, Enfield Southgate. “Potentially, there could be a ‘Boris Johnson moment’,” says Beales, “but my interest in standing isn’t about headlines, it’s because I think the area deserves a Labour MP and we desperately need a Labour government.” But he will also be targeting Johnson personally. “People deserve a full-time MP, I’ve heard so many times from people of all political persuasions that they don’t get a response from Boris’s office, and that he only turns up once a year.” Beales, who is Camden council’s regeneration chief, says: “The basic job of being a representative, is that you’re available, accessible, and responsive.” As the son of a single mother, Beales taunted his future opponent in his selection victory speech, reminding the audience that Johnson once dismissed children of single parents as “ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. It was a proud moment for his watching mother, says Beales, adding: “I couldn’t be more proud of my upbringing. It’s people like my mum and grandparents that make places like Uxbridge and South Ruislip, not people like Boris Johnson.” The selection of Beales, who is regarded as a Keir Starmer loyalist and once backed Liz Kendall as party leader, was criticised by some on the left as a stitch-up. The local selection panel was disbanded on a seemingly flimsy pretext and the process passed to Labour London, the regional party that overwhelmingly backed Beales. Asked why the panel was disbanded, Beales began to answer by saying: “I am not aware.” He was then interrupted by his smart watch, which in a computerised voice said: “I don’t know what you mean by ‘I am not aware’.” Seemingly corrected, Beales says: “I am aware that the selection committee was disbanded, I’ve never been told exactly why.” Unruffled, he adds: “Members were given a vote. I don’t know how much of a stitch-up that can be.” Beales describes himself as a “pragmatic socialist”, and says he is keen to focus away from internal Labour politics and towards the community he needs to win over. As a child he was made homeless in Uxbridge when his mother lost her job. He says the experience gave him an insight into the cost of living pressures facing voters now. Beales is head of policy and campaigns at the National Aids Trust and a proud member of the LGBT community. He expects his political opponents will try to use his sexuality to try to gain support in a socially conservative area. “Maybe the Conservatives will use it to distract from their failings in office and the failing of the incumbent to be a decent full-time MP,” says Beales. “But knocking on doors, I know people like my grandparents are worried about the cost of heating and housing. They’re worried about the ability of their kids to stay in the borough to get jobs to be afford the weekly shop. They’re not worried about LGBT people.” His grandparents, like 56% of people in the area, voted to leave the EU and have voted Conservative in the past.

Turner was taking pictures of passersby and Ivan stopped to ask him about them. Something about Ivan intrigued Turner. “He gave the impression of being homeless,” he suggests, “but also he clearly looked after himself.” Turner took Ivan’s picture and over the year or two that followed the pair would see each other quite often. Turner got to fill in some of Ivan’s story: he lived alone – dividing his time between a flat outside town and in a caravan on a scrap of land he had bought – and suffered from a form of psychosis that meant he was plagued by voices in his head. But he was also relentlessly positive, a friendly face to many in the town. At the beginning of lockdown, Turner’s marriage had just broken down and he found himself visiting and photographing Ivan more often. “I realised what I was doing in my portraits of Ivan was channelling memories of the vulnerabilities of my own difficult childhood into Ivan’s life as a vulnerable adult,” Turner says. The set-ups of the photographs and captions started to merge their histories – particularly their shared issues with religion – to ask questions about mental health and human connection. Turner calls his pictures “The Divided Self”. He half-imagines the series might go on until both he and Ivan “are pensioners sitting on a bench somewhere”. “Place is important to Ivan,” Turner says. “The picture with Foggy [the sheep] is typical. When he got his caravan he bought four sheep to live on the land. When he was away he asked some neighbouring travellers to look after the sheep on the understanding that they would keep them away from the ram. They clearly failed. There are now about 12 sheep on Ivan’s land.” The picture comes with a quote from the book of Isaiah: “He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart.” See more of Greg Turner’s photography on his website"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T19:07:20Z","webTitle":"Russia to stage ‘provocation’ at nuclear plant, warns Ukrainian military","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/18/un-chief-presidents-zelenskiy-erdogan-talks-ukraine-grain-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey’s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site. “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Video footage shared online by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant’s engine room near the turbo generator. In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania. The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea. Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN leader’s trip, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. On Wednesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Ukraine’s hydrometeorological institute also warned of contamination spreading across Europe, a BBC journalist reported. Two issues are causing deepening anxiety about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict. A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant’s operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers, despite the Russian military’s presence at the site. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling. On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world. He will then continue to Turkey to visit the Joint Coordination Centre, the body tasked with overseeing the accord. Ukraine’s fields feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide, so the abrupt halt to shipments has pushed up global grain prices at a time when famine is already threatening east Africa. The UN last month brokered an agreement to let shipments restart. So far, 24 ships have left Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, a monitoring group said. Kyiv has a backlog of 18m tonnes of grain from last year’s harvest, even as it starts bringing in the 2022 crop. It hopes to soon raise exports to 3m tonnes a month, easing world prices and clearing storage space for new grain. It will be six months on 24 August since the start of the invasion – which Russia calls a “special military operation” – and several UN security council members, including the US, Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Norway, have called for a meeting on that date. Kyiv is expected to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine in the coming weeks and has carried out spectacular attacks deep inside Russian-held territory, including on an airbase in Crimea. But despite shipments of western weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is still struggling against heavy Russian artillery bombardment along the eastern front. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video on Wednesday that the war had reached a “strategic deadlock”. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/17/lesson-northern-ireland-police-data-breach-cruelty-the-troubles","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"In Northern Ireland, even a data breach can be deadly – and the ripple effects could be disastrous | Martin Kettle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/17/lesson-northern-ireland-police-data-breach-cruelty-the-troubles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/17/lesson-northern-ireland-police-data-breach-cruelty-the-troubles","fields":{"bodyText":"Half of the people who live in these islands have no adult memory at all of the Northern Ireland troubles. Too many of those who can remember them have allowed the bombings, shootings, riots and violence to slip from their minds in the 25 years that have passed since a peace treaty was signed in 1998. But last week’s data leak by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) ought to be a wake-up call for the forgetful, and a lightbulb moment for the unaware. Nine days ago, in response to a freedom of information request whose provenance remains unclear, someone in the PSNI mistakenly put the names, initials, ranks, place of work and departments of all of its 10,000 officers and staff online for about three hours before they were removed. Especially in a profession where police and their families were, and sometimes still are, regular targets, it was a spectacular security breach, even in these more peaceful times. Then, on Monday, the full impact and the seriousness became clearer. Four documents from the leak, with names blocked out, were pasted to a Falls Road wall in west Belfast near a Sinn Féin office. Posted on the wall above them was a taunt directed at the veteran republican Gerry Kelly, convicted of the IRA’s Old Bailey bombings in London in 1973 but, for the past 30 years, a familiar Sinn Féin pillar of the peace process who now sits on the Northern Ireland policing board. The A4 piece of paper said: “Gerry, We know who Your mates Are.” The how and why of the original leak raise deep questions. So do the how and why of Monday’s wall postings, apparently confirming that the data is in dissident republican hands. Puzzling out the answers will have occupied investigators not just in the PSNI but in MI5 – and Sinn Féin – from the moment the leak occurred. The London and Dublin governments will be receiving detailed daily updates at the highest level. Central to these will be a judgment about whether the dissidents are capable, now that they armed with such priceless intelligence, of launching the kind of campaigns that the IRA waged during the Troubles. It is too soon to say if Wednesday’s PSNI arrest in Lurgan of a man suspected of collecting information of value to terrorists represents a key breakthrough. In the meantime, the rest of us should be very clear about two things. The police names and other details appear now to be in the possession of people who, if they can, will terrorise and kill some of those on the lists. At a stroke, it turns what, until last week, was only a dangerous possibility into something with potential, if it is not nipped in the bud. It may also be a recruiting officer for terrorists. The leak is a lurching event for the whole of Northern Ireland. That’s particularly true for those on the lists from Catholic backgrounds, some of whom are already rethinking their careers and lives in the PSNI. But in Northern Ireland’s tentative and incomplete post-Troubles cohesion, the consequences may ricochet in several other directions. Mishandled any further, this leak could begin to undermine multiple aspects of ordinary life, as well as affecting the bedrock issues of jobs, the economy and politics. That places even more responsibility on the shoulders of British, Irish and, above all, Northern Ireland’s politicians to prevent that possibility. In the 1990s, democratic power-sharing proved it was the only viable alternative to the violence that had caused more than 3,500 deaths in the previous 30 years. That lesson needs to be reapplied in the 2020s as a matter of priority. This means above all that Northern Ireland’s power-sharing institutions have to be reactivated. This rests principally in the hands of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), which collapsed the institutions in February 2022 in its opposition to the Northern Ireland protocol in the UK’s Brexit deal. Part of the DUP will see the PSNI crisis simply as an opportunity to press for concessions on the protocol. The party’s leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, who wants power sharing to resume, has this opportunity to draw the opposite conclusion. The PSNI crisis could be the moment to renew the peace process and rally around it. If Donaldson has an inner David Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist official Alex Kane suggested this week, this is his moment. If Donaldson has a motive to turn threat into opportunity, then so does Rishi Sunak. Restoring the Northern Ireland institutions may not have huge electoral resonance across Britain. But Sunak needs a win, and this one really matters. The UK government has a looming Northern Ireland investment conference on 12 September. Sunak will have it in his diary. It will have far more energy if power sharing has been restored than if things continue to drift. Somewhere in Whitehall, perhaps even in No 10 itself, there must be a copy of a book called Lost Lives. First published in 1999, updated in 2004, and now almost impossible to acquire, Lost Lives is a monumental and dispassionate litany. It enumerates each death of the Troubles, whoever the victim and whatever the circumstances. Like the more recent The Dead of the Irish Revolution, covering 1916 to 1921, it is a detailed roll call of the perished, not a narrative. A copy should be found for Sunak. For Lost Lives to be out of print is a scandal. But that fact is also a metaphor. The seriousness of what is at stake in the aftermath of the PSNI leak is profound. The capacity for callousness and cruelty that marked the Troubles seems to be slipping out of memory. But history can never be confined to the books.

World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukraine’s independence day on Wednesday, with the country mostly locked down because of the threat of Russian attacks. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of shelling the site. “They just started doing that, they starting all the shelling, just to take out these lines,” Kotin said. Other threats to nuclear security at the plant include vehicles packed so tightly into turbine halls that firefighters would struggle to access them if a fire broke out, and a campaign of terror against workers who have chosen to stay at the frontline plant. One was beaten to death, and another so severely injured that he needed three months to recover. More than 200 have been detained, Kotin said. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During a shift between grid systems, the plant would be reliant only on a back-up diesel-powered generator, with no further options should that fail. After only 90 minutes without power the reactors would reach a dangerous temperature. “During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” Russia seized control of the Zaporizhzhia plant in March but it is still run by Ukrainian workers. There has been increasing alarm about Russian management of the site in recent weeks, and pressure on Moscow to allow UN inspectors to visit. Kotin said inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog could be at the plant within one or two weeks to check on security, after progress in negotiations with Russia about a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Kotin is also concerned about the fire risk from vehicles packed into the turbine halls, which sit next to the two reactors still in operation. There are 14 trucks in one hall, and at least six in another, sources at the plant have told him. “In case there is a fire in the turbine hall you don’t even have a possibility to put it out or mitigate the consequences of this fire, because your fire brigades cannot get in, because any entry is blocked by the trucks, which are just packed in there,” he said. Any blaze could then potentially spread towards the reactor buildings, where a fire would have disastrous implications far beyond the immediate region. “This situation is very dangerous not only for the plant, for Ukraine, but also for the whole world because you never can say what the weather would be like and what the wind direction [would be].” Many other military vehicles are lined up under overpasses, built to house pipes and walkways between reactor and turbine complexes, Kotin said, perhaps to provide protection from drones. He praised about 9,000 workers who are still on duty at the plant, from a prewar workforce of about 11,000. Many evacuated their families but stayed at their posts because of the need for a skilled team to operate it. Modernisations to Ukraine’s nuclear plants in the wake of the Chornobyl disaster means that although the plant was built to Soviet specifications, Russian engineers don’t have the skills to operate it. “Actually, for us they are heroes, just doing their job in such unbelievable conditions,” said Kotin, who knows the plant, and its workers well because he spent most of his career there. He arrived as a young graduate and rose to become general manager. Rockets have also landed within two dozen metres of 174 spent fuel containers housed at the plant, which would be more vulnerable to weapons than the reactors, which are built to withstand the impact of a passenger jet. “It will probably withstand two explosions of maybe two missiles on one container and after that, it will be broken,” he said. “Actually we had a rocket came in just 10, 20 metres just from the site [where the containers are stored].” However, Kotin said that he hoped nuclear inspectors would be able to visit the Zaporizhzhia plant within “one, maybe two weeks”. “There is progress in negotiations … there is only modalities of the mission to finally agree between parties, and after that they will go. And actually I’ve seen some plans that they are to go at the end of the month.” He said he also had confidence that Ukrainian workers who have sacrificed so much for the plant would be able to keep it safe. “In any case, we won’t allow Russians to bring the world to the nuclear catastrophe and we will do everything just to return the plant to under our full control and operate it safely reliably, like it always been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/11/home-affairs-tried-to-water-down-report-critical-of-extraordinary-counter-terror-powers-documents-reveal","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T21:50:31Z","webTitle":"Home affairs tried to water down report critical of ‘extraordinary’ counter-terror powers, documents reveal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/home-affairs-tried-to-water-down-report-critical-of-extraordinary-counter-terror-powers-documents-reveal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/home-affairs-tried-to-water-down-report-critical-of-extraordinary-counter-terror-powers-documents-reveal","fields":{"bodyText":"Department of Home Affairs officials told researchers to water down a key report that threatened to undermine the government’s use of “extraordinary” counter-terror powers allowing individuals to be imprisoned for a crime they have not yet committed, documents show. Australia’s preventive detention regime for terror offenders, which allows individuals to be imprisoned for up to three years to prevent a future crime, has been described as “extraordinary” and disproportionate by the nation’s independent national security laws watchdog, who called for its abolishment in March and said it was causing Australia to become a “coarser and harsher society”. The powers, deployed using court-ordered continuing detention orders (CDOs), rely on the use of tools designed to assess the risk of someone committing a future terror offence or engaging in violent extremism. In 2018, the home affairs department engaged leading researchers at the Australian National University to review the accuracy of the risk assessment tools. Their report was damning, finding a lack of evidence had “serious implications” for their validity and reliability. The Morrison government was handed the report in May 2020 but sat on it and did not provide it to courts in cases where CDOs or extended supervision orders (ESOs) were being considered, denying individuals material casting doubt on the assessment process and prompting scathing criticism by defence lawyers and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM). Internal documents obtained by Guardian Australia using freedom of information laws show that, once the researchers submitted their findings, the Department of Home Affairs attempted to remove the most serious criticisms contained in the report. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The department emailed researchers in June 2020 to tell them to “reconsider” findings suggesting two of the risk assessment tools, known as Vera-2R and Radar, were not fit for purpose. It also urged them to “revisit the writing tone” to avoid suggestions that “the Australian government should dispense with both tools”. “This is the section of the report most readers will visit,” the department told the ANU researchers, referring to the report’s executive summary. “We would be grateful if you would revisit the writing tone. Some decision makers might misinterpret your findings as they are currently expressed and conclude that the Australian Government should dispense with both tools, leaving law enforcement and correctional agencies with only operational experience.” In another comment on the draft report, the department told the researchers to “reconsider how to express your finding”, apparently concerned at a suggestion that the tools should not be used. “[These] represent important elements of your research findings, but we are concerned that the finding as they are expressed suggests that the instruments are not fit for purpose. We invite you to reconsider how to express your finding here and in the body of the report.” The correspondence also refers to an earlier meeting during which, according to the department, the researchers said they “did not mean to suggest that the department should cease using the VERA2R and Radar instruments”. “We are concerned that the casual reader or a reader without a research background might conclude that this is the report’s main conclusion,” the department told the researchers. “We request a paragraph to avoid this potential misinterpretation.” The report was published with some changes, though it remained scathing and the ANU said “no changes were made to the fundamental research outcomes”. It also said the two researchers, Emily Corner and Helen Taylor, had no control over the report once it was submitted to government. “Dr Corner and Dr Taylor submitted the evaluation findings to the Department of Home Affairs in May 2020,” a spokesperson said. “Their involvement in the process ended at this point. It was then up to the Department to produce the report.” “No changes were made to the fundamental research outcomes.” After receiving the report in May 2020, the Department of Home Affairs failed to provide the report in a series of cases where CDOs or ESOs were being sought. Legal Aid lawyers have previously told Guardian Australia they were left oblivious to its existence in 25 separate cases where the government was seeking post-sentence detention or supervision of their clients. In March, the INSLM, Grant Donaldson, recommended that CDOs be abolished and ESOs be significantly overhauled, including to promote a better focus on rehabilitation. The existence of the ANU report was only revealed during the INSLM’s inquiry into the regime. Donaldson said there was “no excuse” for not having provided the report to defendants during court proceedings. The department said it could not comment because matters remained before the court, but said the “research was commissioned to contribute to the department’s understanding of violent extremism risk assessment tools, including to support the ongoing refinement of these tools by the authors”. The department has also received other reports about the risk assessment tools which are less critical of their accuracy and validity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"Power cycle: could tracking periods help female athletes break records?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/oct/23/power-cycle-could-tracking-periods-help-female-athletes-break-records","fields":{"bodyText":"It should have been a show of British sporting dominance when Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita made it to the 100-metre final of the European Championships in August. Then, unexpectedly, Asher-Smith pulled up and Neita was not quick enough for the gold, both because of cramps. Later, Asher-Smith revealed hers to be a symptom of her period and shared her frustration at its impact on her sport. If it were a men’s issue, she argued, it would have been fixed by now. It is a feeling shared by many fellow athletes and coaches, including Chelsea FC’s manager, Emma Hayes. “Once a month for potentially up to around five days, many female players have an event that can cause significant distress and impact heavily on their performance,” she wrote in the Telegraph earlier this year. “Athletes deserve a greater understanding of the array of symptoms that can crop up.” That demand is increasingly being heard. Sports science companies have begun offering consultancy packages to help athletes “work proactively” with their cycles to stay on top, and their approach has already found disciples: the coach of the US women’s football team partly attributes their 2019 World Cup win to it. Sports institutes in several European countries have also started projects to equip their athletes with similar strategies ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. But even if periods are given more attention in sport, what can anyone actually offer athletes struggling with their periods? In a field still full of unknowns, some researchers believe that understanding the menstrual cycle will not just free athletes from symptoms, but take them to new, record-breaking heights. *** For an athlete with bad period symptoms, the menstrual cycle’s fluctuating hormones and monthly bleeding are not just a fleeting annoyance. As the Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui found at the 2016 Rio Olympics when she failed to make the podium because of period fatigue, it can be the difference between winning a medal and going home empty-handed. Considering such high stakes and the fact that women’s participation in elite sport has soared – the Olympics included only 20% women in 1976 but reached gender parity for the first time at Tokyo 2020 – it is no surprise that the demand for solutions to period problems in sport has increased accordingly. At the same time, it is “absolutely true” that research is lacking, says Kathryn Ackerman, a sports medicine physician and endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital in Massachusetts. “This is something that I and my international colleagues who study women’s health and female athletes have been saying for a long time.” Women only make up 39% of participants in sports science studies, according to a study in 2014. Kirsty Elliott-Sale, professor of female endocrinology and exercise physiology at Manchester Metropolitan University, says there is research but often “it is not high-quality”. This has resulted in trends with only patchy evidence taking off, such as training or eating according to a prediction of what phase of their cycle the athlete is in. “[Speaking as] somebody who’s been researching the field for 25 years,” says Elliott-Sale, “there isn’t research evidence to support that.” But in the world of elite sport, some argue that bulletproof evidence matters less than in academia. Jessica Piasecki, a researcher of female physiology at Nottingham Trent University and the fastest female British marathon runner bar Paula Radcliffe, says that athletes want to find what works for them, not necessarily what produces a statistically significant result. “If they perceptually feel that their performance is better, then that’s great,” she says. There is a long history of doing things within elite sport that is not fully scientifically evidenced. Ice baths as a recovery technique, for example, are controversial, she says, “but loads of athletes use it because it makes their legs feel better.” One popular intervention is anti-inflammatory food. During the menstrual cycle, inflammation in the body increases at different points, and since some studies have linked such inflammation to unwelcome symptoms, the logic goes that athletes can counter their symptoms by consuming foods thought to reduce inflammation, such as turmeric, tart cherry juice and ginger, at the right time. The sports science company Orreco subscribes to this idea. Orreco has its athlete clients track their periods and symptoms with an app, and then it uses the data to formulate advice on nutrition, says one of its sports and exercise physiologists, Esther Goldsmith. According to her, this approach has helped many athletes, including players from the England women’s football team. “One of their players was really, really suffering,” she says. “We basically threw the kitchen sink at her.” Six months after implementing changes to her nutrition and lifestyle, the player’s symptoms were apparently gone. Goldsmith appreciates that the evidence is “limited and sometimes contradictory”. For example, in 2016, a review concluded that while there is some evidence that ginger can lessen period pain, it also highlighted that studies on the topic were few, small and often imperfect. But, she says, “we can’t just sit back and say, ‘No sorry, we can’t intervene because the research isn’t there.’” *** Faced with navigating such a complicated maze to deal with periods, some opt for hormonal birth control. On the pill, bleeding can be avoided altogether by skipping the usual break, and even without skipping it, the monthly bleeding will not be an actual period because the pill has blocked ovulation. This means that while athletes are on hormonal birth control, they will not have periods. That can be problematic, says Nicky Keay, a sports endocrinologist and physician. Birth control “is every woman’s choice”, she says, but in her forthcoming book, Hormones, Health and Human Potential, she details how hormonal contraception can mask the sudden loss of periods, a strong indication of the condition known as relative energy deficiency in sport (Red-S), the result of training too much and eating too little. As a driven athlete, the balance is easy to get wrong. Pippa Woolven, a recently retired runner for Great Britain, says she developed Red-S when she got a sport scholarship to the US and was keen to progress. “I increased my training load and started to experience more and more pressures surrounding body image, diet, nutrition,” she says. This did translate to quicker run times until things went awry. She felt ill and fatigued most of the time. “It became quite difficult to function as a human being, let alone an athlete.” Because she was on the pill for contraceptive reasons, she did not realise that she had stopped getting her period. The danger with Red-S is that it can affect long-term bone health, says Ackerman. When the body has an energy deficit and the menstrual cycle is suppressed, it disrupts oestrogen, which is important for maintaining bones. If athletes get Red-S in their early youth when they should be building bone density, “they’ll be at much higher risk of stress fractures, low bone density and osteoporosis,” says Ackerman. The same is true for boys and men. Their testosterone levels might fall, and as testosterone is converted to oestrogen in the body, their bone health also suffers. And like periods, Red-S symptoms for men can also feel too intimate to discuss openly. “One of the signs of Red-S in a male athlete is that they have decreased libido and they don’t get normal morning erections,” Ackerman says. “We need to normalise it and not sexualise it, but just talk about these things as signs.” It was only when Woolven got in touch with Keay that she found her way to recovery. Now, she heads up the charity Project Red-S to spread awareness. Understanding that periods are markers of health that athletes should monitor before they do permanent damage to themselves is critical, she says. In a way, it is similar to concussions in rugby. Athletes enter the sport without knowing the full extent of the risk to their health, she says. *** There are some who believe the menstrual cycle could be even more than a health marker. Ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, France’s National Institute of Sport, Expertise, and Performance (Insep) has taken an interest in the possibility that working in sync with the menstrual cycle’s hormone fluctuations could lead to gains in performance – and more medals. “We are approaching human limits of performance,” says Juliana Antero, who is heading up the Insep project Empowe’her (Exploring Menstrual Periods of Women Athletes to Escalate Ranking). In 2015, she was involved in a study that examined 3,263 world records across disciplines such as the 400-metre sprint and the triple jump, and found a consistent decrease in both the frequency and degree of improvement in new world records since the 1990s. The data revealed occasional step changes, such as the 2008 to 2009 introduction of polyurethane swimsuits, and Antero believes that understanding the menstrual cycle could provide another bump. There could be a perfect hormone level for breaking world records. And it is easy to see how, as new hormone-testing technology becomes available, athletes might better understand relationships between their hormones and their performance, and plan accordingly. The English Institute of Sport is trialling hormone saliva tests in collaboration with the company Mint Diagnostics, hoping to provide track-side results in minutes, for symptom treatment and, down the line, for performance gains. Elliott-Sale is intrigued by this idea, but remains sceptical. “I do think [tracking and managing symptoms] will make a difference for some sportswomen,” she says. If Asher-Smith’s calf cramp could have been avoided, she might have had a go at gold. But for athletes who are not greatly affected already, she believes the potential gains will be marginal. “I don’t personally think it is going to change the face of women’s sport.” She says we have to remember that many sportswomen manage perfectly well or might not even have cycles. “If I was that elite sportswoman who was underachieving because of my cycle, I’d be screaming from the rooftop ‘help me, help me’.” But, she says, “will it change a whole team, a whole squad, a nation, all sportswomen? Probably not.” Antero’s work shows that we currently know of few consistent effects of the menstrual cycle on performance, but she believes this will soon change. The menstrual cycle is incredibly individual and because the hormone levels are not consistent for each participant, trials struggle to pick anything up. But if we track the cycle of the individual, we could untangle how it affects them both negatively and positively, says Antero. “I believe we can enhance female-athlete performance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/12/london-tube-disruption-power-cut-victoria-line-piccadilly-delays","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T08:31:43Z","webTitle":"London tube faces severe disruption after power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/12/london-tube-disruption-power-cut-victoria-line-piccadilly-delays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/12/london-tube-disruption-power-cut-victoria-line-piccadilly-delays","fields":{"bodyText":"London Underground services suffered severe disruption on Monday morning due to “power supply problems”, Transport for London (TfL) said.

More than 560,000 homes were reported to be still without power in California as of early Sunday, according to data from PowerOutage.us. At least six people have died in the severe weather since New Year’s weekend, including a toddler killed by a fallen redwood tree crushing a mobile home in northern California. Forecasters have meanwhile warned yet another “atmospheric river” of dense, moist tropical air will clobber California on Monday with rain and mountain snow. That weather is just the first of five approaching atmospheric rivers – a stream of storms that will continue until about 19 January – arrived in the state this weekend. An NWS weather alert on Saturday warned that the cumulative effect of successive heavy rain storms since late December could bring rivers to record high levels and cause flooding across much of central California. The heavy recent rains have had a huge impact on the state and caused rivers and streams to overflow, sent floods down street and highways, and submerged vehicles, homes, and businesses. The storms have also whipped waves to historic heights along the California coast. Drought-hit California had been on track for another dry winter until the stacked atmospheric rivers came into play. However, most experts believe the state will need a lot more water before the long-term drought could be considered meaningfully broken."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/29/amid-the-smoke-of-war-power-in-europe-is-shifting-decisively-to-the-east","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T09:00:44Z","webTitle":"Amid the smoke of war, power in Europe is shifting decisively to the east | Jonathan Eyal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/amid-the-smoke-of-war-power-in-europe-is-shifting-decisively-to-the-east","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/29/amid-the-smoke-of-war-power-in-europe-is-shifting-decisively-to-the-east","fields":{"bodyText":"Huffing and puffing and occasionally fluffing his words during months of tense diplomatic negotiations, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has finally agreed to supply Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. The numbers involved are not impressive; as things stand, only 14 German tanks will get a fresh lick of paint with Ukrainian military markings. Still, his decision has removed a significant obstacle to Ukraine’s rearmament. Finland, Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands have already announced that they will transfer some of their Leopards and Norway and Spain are not far behind. The Leopard tank contingent could, therefore, end up being quite substantial, providing Ukraine with the ability to flush out Russian troops from their dugouts, thereby injecting much-needed mobility into a war of attrition that currently allows Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to kill civilians and pulverise Ukraine’s economic infrastructure systematically and primarily with impunity. Nato governments are relieved that Scholz has finally made the right choice, albeit only after trying everything else. The United States and Europe are “fully, thoroughly, totally united”, President Joe Biden joyfully claimed after the German tank decision became known. And reports from Berlin indicate that, far from being apologetic about his dithering, Scholz believes that he has acquitted himself well. He kept his Social Democratic party united on a profoundly controversial question. He also persuaded the Americans to supply their tanks alongside Germany’s. Sadly, much of this positive narrative is wishful thinking, for it ignores both the abrupt collapse of Germany’s influence in Europe and the continent’s profound strategic transformation because of the Ukraine war. The decision to supply Ukraine with tanks amounts to a significant deepening of western military involvement in the conflict; Ukraine’s western backers have agreed to take a higher risk because they concluded – correctly – that allowing Putin’s war of attrition to continue is far riskier. But this is just the first in many further escalatory steps that Nato governments are certain to face in the coming months, regardless of how the war develops. If the inevitable Russian spring offensive against Ukraine proves more successful than currently feared, demands will grow for the supply of fighter jets to Ukraine’s armed forces. So will suggestions of an even more direct Nato involvement in defending Ukraine’s skies. Today, that’s unthinkable. But then, supplying western tanks was also taboo until recently. Conversely, if the anticipated Ukrainian offensive does better than Nato military planners anticipate, the question of the liberation of occupied Crimea – with the expected fleeing of hundreds of thousands of Russian settlers from the peninsula – will arise. And so would the risk that the Putin regime will resort to a nuclear escalation in order to stave off total humiliation and collapse. Scholz’s propensity to take every strategic decision far too late and only under duress has already seriously damaged European security. But it could be catastrophic to the critical choices facing Nato in the months ahead. The chancellor has done little to explain to ordinary Germans what the impending delivery of tanks means for his country’s engagement or how he views the next steps in the war. Unsurprisingly, his public opinion remains divided, with “half of Germans sitting in the tank and the other half seeking to jump out”, as the Russian-born writer Wladimir Kaminer aptly put it. The only proposition Germans now accept is that Scholz lacks leadership qualities; the latest opinion polls indicate that only a quarter of voters consider him a strong leader. So, far from being transformative, Germany’s tank decision offers no reassurance that the future strategic choices of Europe’s most significant and wealthiest nation will be reached with the speed or the determination that will be increasingly necessary. Nor is there a serious appreciation in Berlin of how much Germany will need to adapt to the fundamental changes that have taken place in Europe because of the Ukraine carnage. The continent’s strategic centre of gravity has shifted decisively from its western tip, where Germany and France used to decide matters, and towards central and eastern Europe. Throughout the Ukraine war, pressure from countries such as the Baltic states and Poland forced Berlin into making a choice. These nations have gained moral authority because they were far more lucid and realistic about the danger of an imperial Russia and are also exercising a more direct and practical influence over the continent’s decision-making. This means that some of the old dreams about promoting a “European strategic autonomy” distinct from the US are redundant; Scholz indirectly acknowledged Europe’s dependence on the US last week by demanding that American tanks accompany German ones into Ukraine. It also means that Franco-German plans to uphold a clear distinction between countries in or out of institutions such as the European Union and Nato must be abandoned. Britain remains a critical player in European security, notwithstanding Brexit. Despite the absence of any formal security connection with the EU, its reputation, footprint and influence in the conduct of the Ukraine war are far more extensive than that of either France or Germany. And, conversely, no future stability and security for Ukraine are feasible without that country becoming – in substance, if not in form – a member of both the EU and Nato. Germany’s real task is to acknowledge this fundamental European transformation. Instead, Scholz still seems to believe that, as he recently put it, if Russia withdraws its troops from Ukraine, “we can come back to a peace order that worked and make it safe again”. This is utter nonsense. Germany will reassert its European importance when the guns eventually fall silent and the world looks to Berlin’s deep pockets to help with Ukraine’s reconstruction. But Germany will struggle to influence the reshaping of Europe’s security map. • Dr Jonathan Eyal is associate director, strategic research partnerships, Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Wednesday’s report criticises the initial stages of the program to build nine new Hunter-class frigates for the Royal Australian Navy – a process that occurred during the former Coalition government’s time in office. The report’s release coincided with the Labor government introducing new legislation to pave the way for another complex and expensive shipbuilding project: acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under the Aukus pact. The Australian National Audit Office (Anao) found that the Department of Defence’s management of the Hunter class procurement had been only “partly effective”. “Defence’s procurement process and related advisory processes lacked a value for money focus, and key records, including the rationale for the procurement approach, were not retained,” the report tabled in parliament said. “Contract expenditure to date has not been effective in delivering on project milestones, and the project is experiencing an 18-month delay and additional costs due in large part to design immaturity.” The report said the design issues had driven up the cost to Defence by $423m so far. But it added: “At January 2023 the project was forecast to exceed the whole of project budget approved by government by a significant amount.” The Turnbull government announced in June 2018 that the Hunter class frigates would be designed by the British company BAE Systems and built at the Osborne shipyard in Adelaide. The then government said it had made the decision after “a rigorous and comprehensive competitive evaluation process” that had also considered options from Italy’s Fincantieri and Spain’s Navantia. But the Anao found the advice provided to the government was “not complete”, because Defence had failed to make clear that a value-for-money assessment had not been conducted. Defence recommended the BAE option “based primarily on anti-submarine warfare capability”, but some documents surrounding the process were not retained, the report said. The contract management plan was established only three and a half years after the contract was executed. Responding to the Anao report, the Department of Defence agreed to two recommendations to improve its processes, but disputed the findings. “Defence demonstrably considered value for money throughout the procurement process,” the department said. But the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the Anao report “demonstrates yet again the bungling and mismanagement of critical defence projects by the former Coalition government”. The Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said the “scathing” report placed “even more question marks around the capacity of Defence to deliver” the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project. A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: “The Hunter program continues to make strong progress and we have begun building the first schedule protection block – which will be used in the first ship. We remain committed to building nine anti-submarine warfare frigates for the Royal Australian Navy.” The Hunter class frigate program is under fresh scrutiny because the Albanese government has ordered a new review of the navy’s surface fleet needs. The retired US navy Vice-Admiral William Hilarides – who has long been a source of advice to successive Australian governments on naval matters – is one of three people appointed to conduct the review over the next few months. The others are the former Department of Finance secretary Rosemary Huxtable and retired Royal Australian Navy Vice-Admiral Stuart Mayer. They will consider whether any changes are needed to the navy’s surface fleet plans in light of the decision to acquire nuclear-powered submarines. On Wednesday the government introduced a bill to clarify that the existing ban on civil nuclear power in Australia does not prevent “conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines”. The submarine program is expected to cost between $268bn and $368bn over the period from now to the mid-2050s."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2023/sep/04/tom-markus-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-04T17:02:43Z","webTitle":"Tom Markus obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/04/tom-markus-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2023/sep/04/tom-markus-obituary","fields":{"bodyText":"My father, Tom Markus, who has died aged 95, was the first professor of building science at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where he established a thriving research base and, inspired by his socialist politics and Catholic faith, made huge efforts to address housing problems in the city. In 1971 he helped set up the Assist project in Govan to rehabilitate old tenement buildings. In 1979 he founded and chaired the Right to Warmth campaign, bringing together legal, architectural and medical expertise to push for improvements in cold and damp housing. He worked to bring an end to “slopping out” in Scottish prisons, and gave evidence in the House of Commons about the dangers of coating residential buildings in flammable material – in 1984, three decades before the Grenfell fire. In all these campaigns Tom was questioning power. He believed the hierarchical hold of one group over another could only be countered by solidarity. In his book Order in Space and Society (1982), he demonstrated how buildings created ordered relationships. He launched himself into campaigning and writing, and an abiding memory is of him coming home from yet another evening spent measuring the dampness in a council flat, where a child had been coughing and wheezing. Born in Budapest, his father, Victor, owned an engineering company, Márkus Lajos, and his mother, Lili (nee Engel), was a ceramic artist. As a Jewish family threatened by growing antisemitism, they left Hungary in 1939, and came to Britain, where they found refuge. Tom studied architecture at Manchester University, where he met Beryl McDermott, a law student, and they married in 1954. Both were part of a group of socialist and Catholic students and staff in Manchester, and he was baptised during this period. Their political commitment and religious faith underpinned much of their lives together. From 1956 to 1964 he worked for the glass manufacturer Pilkington, developing an expertise in the technical aspects of building that would become the foundation of his academic career. He was appointed professor of building science at Strathclyde in 1966. After officially retiring, he carried on teaching, examining, writing, researching and campaigning until he was about 90. Beryl died in 2014, but Tom continued to take huge pleasure in family and friends. He is survived by six children, Mary, Kate, Daniel, Peter, Allan and me, and by seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-11T08:59:00Z","webTitle":"No signs Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapon, says GCHQ boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/oct/11/russia-use-nuclear-weapons-gchq-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of GCHQ has said the UK spy agency has not seen any indicators that Russia is preparing to use a tactical nuclear weapon in or around Ukraine despite recent bellicose statements from Vladimir Putin. Jeremy Fleming, speaking on Tuesday morning, said it was one of GCHQ’s tasks to monitor whether the Kremlin was taking any of the preliminary steps needed before a tactical weapon was being made ready. “The way in which the Russian military machine and President Putin are conducting this war, they are staying within the doctrine that we understand for their use, including for nuclear weapons,” Fleming said. But he added that there was no sign that Russia was engaged in any technical preparatory steps: “I would hope that we would see indicators if they started to go down that path,” the spy chief said in a BBC interview. So-called tactical nuclear weapons – which can have a destructive power about six times greater than the Hiroshima bomb – are assembled by pairing a nuclear warhead with a conventional missile with a shorter-range. They are different from the long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are controlled by Russia, the US and other nuclear powers and can be deployed rapidly for the purpose of striking against each other in an uncontrolled war. Experts say it takes time to move such warheads out of storage and it should be possible for a spy agency such as GCHQ or its US counterpart, the NSA, to monitor such movements. “It’s a visible process,” said Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear expert and senior research fellow at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research. “If it’s really rushed you are talking about hours. It will be visible and be made visible.” Last month Putin said he would use “all available means” to defend Russian territory, including parts of Ukraine that he had unilaterally sought to annex – and argued the atomic bombs dropped in 1945 by the US “created a precedent”. That prompted the US president, Joe Biden, to warn last week that the world was closer to Armageddon than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 – although aides said subsequently his comments were not based on fresh intelligence or information. Fleming’s remarks preceded a speech he is due to give on Tuesday afternoon, in which he will accuse Putin of making strategic errors in his pursuit of the war in Ukraine, partly because there are so few restraints on his leadership. Russian soldiers are running out of supplies and munitions and initial gains made by Moscow are being reversed, Fleming is expected to add in the rare public address. “Far from the inevitable Russian military victory that their propaganda machine spouted, it is clear that Ukraine’s courageous action on the battlefield and in cyberspace is turning the tide,” Fleming will say. Focusing on the Russian president directly, Fleming is expected to say that “with little effective internal challenge, his decision-making has proved flawed” and that he has engaged in “a high-stakes strategy that is leading to strategic errors in judgment”. On Monday, Moscow launched a wave of missile strikes aimed at Kyiv and other urban centres, killing at least 11 people, which Putin said was in response to the weekend bombing of the bridge connecting occupied Crimea to Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T10:09:10Z","webTitle":"Lionel Messi leaves top 100 field in wake but Premier League also shows power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/jan/27/lionel-messi-guardian-top-100-premier-league","fields":{"bodyText":"It is sometimes easy to forget that Lionel Messi retired from international football in 2016. Argentina had just lost in the Copa América to Chile, a fourth final defeat in nine years, and Messi had missed a penalty in the shootout. “For me, the national team is over,” he said. “I’ve done all I can. It hurts not to be a champion.” Luckily for Messi, and Argentinian football fans, he changed his mind two months later, in time for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers. The tournament in Russia did not bring the success he or his country had hoped for but three years later it all fell into place for the captain with victory in the Copa América. That win ensured he had his international trophy, but it also meant the pressure had been lifted. Messi was playing for Argentina with a smile again. That lifted the player and his teammates to new heights and it culminated in La Albiceleste winning the 2022 World Cup. The win in Qatar naturally had a huge impact on the voting for the Guardian’s top 100 footballers and it is not outlandish to think that Kylian Mbappé would have finished as the No 1 had France won the shootout against Argentina. But they did not and Messi ended up as the clear winner in our vote with 76% (156 out of 206 judges) of our panel picking him as their No 1. It is a stark contrast to last year’s winner, Robert Lewandowski, who was top of 53% of the judges’ lists. It is a decade since we did our first list and Messi has never been out of our top three, staying remarkably consistent and popular with the judges. The only time he fell out of the top two was in 2018 when Luka Modric usurped him and Cristiano Ronaldo, with the Portuguese in second. The Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, is obviously biased but when asked in Qatar whether Messi was the best player ever he said: “Sometimes as Argentinians it of course looks like we say that just because we are Argentinian. Maybe it’s selfish [but] I don’t have any doubt saying that: he is the best in history.” Messi failed to inspire Paris St-Germain to win the Champions League and that is reflected in the standings of which side have the most players on our list. Manchester City stay top despite, like PSG, falling to the comeback machine that was Real Madrid. Madrid are second with 11 players in the top 100, including Rodrygo for the first time, and have four of the top 10: Karim Benzema, Modric, Vinícius Júnior and Thibaut Courtois, who was outstanding in that final win against Liverpool in Paris. Bayern Munich have the fourth-most players on the list despite going out to Villarreal in the Champions League quarter-finals and despite Germany having a disappointing World Cup. Their highest-ranked player is Sadio Mané, who joined from Liverpool in the summer. PSG still suffer from having a top heavy team, with Messi, Mbappé and Neymar in the top 15 but the only teammates to join them on the top 100 being Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos. Brazil have the most players on our list with 14. Some of the biggest stars are joined further down the list by players such as Gabriel Barbosa, Bruno Guimarães, Fabinho and Thiago Silva. It shows that the rankings are not solely based on the World Cup, despite the timing of the tournament, which meant the deadline for votes was a few weeks after the final. France are also ahead of Argentina with veterans such as Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud, who is 30th after helping Milan to the Serie A title and having a good World Cup, making the top 100 alongside younger players such as Christopher Nkunku and Aurélien Tchouaméni. The strongest league, according to our panel at least, is the behemoth that is the Premier League. It is continuing to grow – albeit only by one player compared with 2021 – and has 43 representatives, with La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga staying at the same number as the previous list. It is worth noting that although we have a 35-year-old winner and the same winner as 10 years ago, there is an abundance of young, talented players coming through. It is clear to see that Mbappé is a likely future winner but there are younger players than the 24-year-old on the list who are upwardly mobile. Erling Haaland and Vinícius are 22 and in the top 10, while Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Jamal Musiala, Bukayo Saka, Pedri, Gavi and Tchouaméni are set to improve their positions. Nothing lasts for ever, they say, and that will be true of Messi being the Guardian’s No 1, but for now he is holding off the youngsters.

Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, the chief executive of the grid operator Ukrenergo, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. The grid operator Ukrenergo said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Russia freed the jailed US basketball star Brittney Griner on Thursday in a high-level prisoner exchange for the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout, who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. Joe Biden, who had made Griner’s release a top priority after she spent almost 10 months in jail on drugs charges, said in an address from the White House that he had spoken with Griner and found her “in good spirits”. The mother of Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. Russian state media reported that he had arrived back in the country. Biden expressed regret that the deal did not include Paul Whelan, an American jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government say are baseless. An anonymous US official told CNN that leaving Whelan out of the deal had been “a difficult decision” but “it was a choice to get Brittney or nothing”. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine, including of the village of Posad-Pokrovske, in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. The notorious arms dealer, Viktor Bout, has arrived back in Russia after his release from US detention in a prisoner swap with Brittney Griner, Russian state media reported. The White House has said the grant of clemency for Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, was not approved until today. Russian shelling of a town in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has left one person dead and two injured, according to the region’s governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. At least 12 houses were destroyed by the shelling in the town of Toretsk, he said in a Telegram post. Kyrylenko wrote: 1 person was killed, 2 more were wounded in artillery shelling of Toretsk. Shells hit a private sector, destroying and damaging at least 12 houses. The Russians are again cynically shelling civilians — they are continuing their terror tactics. The mother of the notorious arms dealer Viktor Bout has thanked Vladimir Putin for her son’s release as part of a swap with the US. Bout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death”, is a former Soviet lieutenant colonel whom the US justice department once described as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers. He was serving a 25-year sentence for conspiring to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of weapons that US officials said were to be used against Americans. He was released from US detention in a prisoner swap for the American basketball star Brittney Griner. He is expected to arrive in Moscow shortly. The release happened “thanks to our president”, Raisa Bout said in televised remarks reported by AFP. She said: I am so grateful. A low maternal bow to the Russian foreign ministry with Lavrov Sergei Viktorovich at its helm. She said she was also grateful to “kind people” in the US, adding: “You cannot say that all of them are evil.” Russia’s human rights commissioner, Tatiana Moskalkova, described Bout as a “wonderful man who has become a victim of American insinuations”. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from a Russian jail and is on her way back to the US, President Joe Biden said. The Russian foreign ministry said it had traded Griner for Viktor Bout, a notorious arms dealer who had been held in a US prison for 12 years. The swap took place at an airport in Abu Dhabi, Russian news agencies reported. Griner, 32, a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was arrested on 17 February. Talks to secure her release were complicated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and the subsequent souring of ties between Washington and Moscow. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said his government was working with the UN’s nuclear watchdog agency to create a safety zone around the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. Kyiv remained “in close contact” with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he said at a joint press conference with his Slovak counterpart, Rastislav Káčer, in Kyiv. Kuleba said: Of course, we are all interested in ensuring that all nuclear power plants, not only the Zaporizhzhia NPP, are safe. This is extremely difficult to achieve without stopping Russian missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, but we are moving forward step by with mutual understanding with the IAEA. There is a rule in diplomacy that nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed. Ukraine’s state nuclear energy firm Energoatom earlier today repeated Kyiv’s claims that Russia was using the site as a de facto weapons depot. Energoatom said Russia had brought multiple rocket launchers to the site and stationed them near the plant’s power unit No 6. It went on to claim that Russian forces planned to use them to launch attacks against Ukrainian positions and bridges on the western bank of the Dnipro River. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has come under repeated shelling since Moscow seized it shortly after launching its invasion in February, prompting the IAEA to call for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. Earlier, we reported that Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukraine’s energy grid and presented the strikes as a response to the explosion on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea in October. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it?” Here’s a clip of Putin speaking while attending a military awards ceremony in the Kremlin today: Pope Francis broke down and wept as he prayed for peace in Ukraine during a traditional Christmas visit to the Spanish Steps in Rome. The pope’s voice began to tremble as he mentioned the suffering of Ukrainians. He said: I would have liked to have brought you the thanks of the Ukrainian people … Reuters reports that Francis had to stop speaking and was unable to continue for about 30 seconds, and his head trembled. The crowd, which included the mayor of Rome, Roberto Gualtieri, applauded when they realised he was unable to talk and saw him crying. When he resumed the prayer, his voice was cracking. He continued: …the Ukrainian people for the peace we have so long asked the Lord. Instead I must present you with the pleas of children, elderly, mothers and fathers and the young people of that martyred land, that is suffering so much. He later tweeted that “peace is possible; disarmament is possible”. It’s 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. The Russian leader presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Putin claimed as his own, the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. He added that the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces, after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, also said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. About 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament, said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Explosions have been reported at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, a senior official said.

Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. The commodities trading firm Trafigura is to hand more than $1.7bn to its top traders and shareholders after the energy crisis, fuelled by the war in Ukraine, led to a surge in profits. Trafigura, one of the world’s largest specialist commodity traders, posted a record $7bn net profit in its last financial year, more than the previous four years combined, after making gains from the market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Its chief financial officer, Christophe Salmon, hailed an “exceptionally strong year” as profits more than doubled and revenues grew to $318.5bn in the year to 30 September, up from $231.3bn a year earlier. The $1.71bn payout to its 1,100 shareholders, including top employees, equates to about $1.56m a head if shared equally. That’s an increase of about 35% compared with 2021’s dividend of $1.12bn to about 1,000 top traders and investors. Oil and gas companies, as well as some electricity generators, have faced windfall taxes as a result of the gains made since the invasion. However, politicians have not moved to curb the profits of commodity traders. Strong trading performances have boosted multinationals including the British oil firms BP and Shell. Read the full story here: Speaking earlier, Joe Biden said Russia was treating the case of the detained American Paul Whelan “differently” but that the US “will never give up” on securing his release. Biden said: Sadly and for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up. The Biden administration has offered Moscow multiple options to secure Whelan, a US official told journalists today. From the Washington Post’s John Hudson: And from Nick Schifrin from PBS: Explosions have been heard at Berdiansk airbase in the Zaporizhzhia region. Three large explosions were heard, as well as smaller ones, near the city on the coast of the Sea of Azov. Emergency services have been reported as making their way to the scene. No casualties have been reported. Russia has used the 35th anniversary of the historic signing of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) to criticise the US for withdrawing from the agreement in 2019. At the time, the then US president Donald Trump gave his reason for doing so as “developing our own military response options,” to Russia’s missiles. Nato allies later backed the US by issuing a statement attributing responsibility for the treaty’s demise to Russia. When the treaty was signed in 1987, the agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to reduce their nuclear arsenals was hailed by some commentators as a significant step towards a non-nuclear world. This is how the Guardian reported the historic event. Vladimir Putin has vowed to continue attacking Ukrainian energy systems despite global criticism of strikes that have left millions without electricity and water at the start of winter. “There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. Yes, we do that. But who started it?” Putin said at an awards ceremony in the Kremlin, according to Agence France-Presse, adding that the criticism would “not interfere with our combat missions”. He presented the strikes as a response to a blast on Moscow’s bridge to annexed Crimea and other attacks, accusing Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said. He accused the west of “complete silence” on this and of bias against Russia. “As soon as we move and do something in response, there is uproar and clamour spreading through the whole universe,” he said. Russia has faced claims that its attacks on Ukraine’s energy systems and infrastructure amount to war crimes. The EU plans to tighten up sanctions on Russia’s military and industrial complex, pro-Kremlin media and Russian nationalist groups fighting in Ukraine, according to leaked papers. The EU’s ninth set of restrictive measures on Russia since February’s invasion of Ukraine seek to close gaps in previous rounds, with further sanctions on 169 entities “which might contribute to the technological enhancement of Russia’s defence and security sector”, according to a draft text seen by the Guardian. These companies will face restrictions on their ability to buy from Europe so-called dual-use goods – civilian products that can be turned to military purposes. Previous EU sanctions have already imposed sweeping bans on hi-tech equipment, but this package adds items that were missed off the list such as generators, toy drones, laptops, cameras and lenses. According to a separate paper, four pro-Kremlin TV companies will lose their licence to broadcast in the EU, including NTV, Rossiya 1, Pervyi Kanal and REN TV, home to some of Russia’s high-profile talkshows featuring strident pro-war commentators. A total of eight individuals are facing personal sanctions, meaning a travel ban and freeze on any assets held in the EU, including Russian officials said to be involved in the illegal transfer and adoption of Ukrainian children in Russia, as well as the leaders of rightwing nationalist groups. In a largely symbolic move, six entities will see any EU assets frozen, including nationalist groups such as the Russian Imperial Legion, the Russian Imperial Movement and Taskforce Rusich. Unlike previous rounds of sanctions, the cost for EU countries is relatively small. Some ideas, such as a ban on the once lucrative trade in Russian diamonds, are conspicuous by their absence. The measures now have to be agreed by all 27 member states before coming into force. Speaking at the White House, Joe Biden formally announced the release of Brittney Griner from detention in Russia and pledged to continue working to bring home another American jailed in the country. “Moments ago, standing together with her wife, Cherelle, in the Oval Office, I spoke with Brittney Griner,” Biden said. She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home after months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under intolerable circumstances. Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along. He thanked officials in his administration who had worked for her release, as well as the United Arab Emirates, “because that’s where she landed”. The president said “the past few months have been hell” for Griner, her family and her teammates. He also mentioned the case of Paul Whelan, another American, whose release from Russia he said he was working on. “We’ve not forgotten about Paul Whelan, who’s been unjustly detained in Russia for years.” For live developments on the release of Griner, do follow our US politics live blog with my colleague Chris Stein: Around 10,000 Ukrainian service personnel and roughly the same number of Ukrainian civilians are believed to be being held in Russian detention facilities, according to Oleksandr Kononenko, who oversees human rights in the security and defence sector on behalf of Ukraine’s parliament. Konenenko said the civilians were being detained illegally as prisoners of war because of their alleged association with the Ukrainian army or state. Kononenko said: These are the total number of confirmed people who are classed as ‘missing under special circumstances’, we do not have the exact figures. Russia has not given the International Committee for the Red Cross access [to the information]. Though the ICRC has not been given full access, it has been able to visit some Ukrainian prisoners. On Thursday, the ICRC made a rare announcement that it had visited one Russian facility and that it planned to visit another this week. “ICRC teams are reaching out to families of prisoners of war to share updates from their loved ones. Most updates are short notes of love and personal news,” read the ICRC statement. In July, Oleh Kotenko, who is in charge of wartime missing people within the Ukrainian ministry for the occupied territories, put the total number of Ukrainian service personnel believed to be held by Russia at significantly less – 7,200. Kotenko said that although Ukraine had not heard from some of those reported missing, they were believed to be alive and in captivity. After Ukraine pushed Russian forces out of parts of Kharkiv and Kherson region, it has announced several prisoner swaps. The regularity of the swaps probably indicate that Ukraine detained Russian prisoners during their offensives. The former US marine Paul Whelan is still in Russian custody, his lawyer said, after news that Brittney Griner was released in a prisoner swap with the Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. Dialogue on a possible prisoner swap for Whelan is ongoing, his lawyer said. Whelan was convicted by a Russian court in 2020 on espionage charges and sentenced to 16 years in a Russian high-security prison. He denied the charges. Joe Biden has tweeted that he has spoken to Brittney Griner, following the announcement that she has been released from Russian detention. In a tweet, he posted pictures of him meeting with Griner’s wife, Cherelle Griner, at the White House. The US basketball star Brittney Griner has been released from Russian detention in a prisoner swap for the convicted Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, US officials have confirmed. Griner was sentenced to nine years behind bars in Russia after being convicted on drug charges. A two-time Olympic gold medallist and champion, she was arrested on 17 February, a week before Russia sent troops into Ukraine, at a Moscow airport while in possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, which is banned in Russia. Bout, known as “the merchant of death”, was one of the world’s most wanted men before his 2008 arrest on multiple charges related to arms trafficking. For almost two decades, he was one of the world’s most notorious arms dealers, selling weaponry to rogue states, rebel groups and murderous warlords in Africa, Asia and South America. Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine. The Kremlin has said the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine, which Russia annexed in 2014, was vulnerable to attacks by Ukrainian forces after officials there said they had shot down a drone near a key naval base. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, the largest city in annexed Crimea, said this morning that Russia’s fleet shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Black Sea. Speaking to reporters during his regular briefing, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: There are certainly risks because the Ukrainian side continues its policy of organising terrorist attacks. But, on the other hand, information we get indicates that effective countermeasures are being taken. His comments came after President Vladimir Putin recently made a visit to the Kerch bridge, the key link between annexed Crimea and mainland Russia which was partially destroyed by an explosion in October. The Russian-installed head of occupied Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said last month that he had ordered “fortification works to ensure the safety of Crimeans” to be built on the peninsula after recent attacks. Speaking during his briefing with reporters today, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia is still set on seizing parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin claimed as his own. The Russian leader announced he had annexed four Ukrainian regions – Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk – after holding fake referendums in order to claim a mandate for his territorial claims. However Moscow does not have full control of any of the four provinces of Ukraine it says it annexed, and Peskov appeared to set a limit on the Ukrainian territory that Russia now sought to claim. Asked whether Russia planned to incorporate any more territories beyond the four regions, he replied: There is no question of that. At least, there have been no statements in this regard. But there is nevertheless a lot of work ahead to liberate the territories; in a number of new regions of the Russian Federation there are occupied territories that have to be liberated. I mean part of the Donetsk Republic, as well as what became part of the Russian Federation, and then was re-occupied by Ukrainian troops. My colleague Peter Beaumont is in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, amid worsening wintry conditions. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has called on Russia to answer for “atrocities” committed by its forces in Ukraine. Thomas-Greenfield was responding to a report by the UN’s human rights office, published yesterday, that found that at least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher. The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine. It said: The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls). Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the US’s withdrawal from a treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was a “destructive” act that created a vacuum and stoked additional security risks. The 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty had kept nuclear missiles off European soil for more than three decades, but the treaty expired in 2019 after the US and Russia failed to agree on how to keep it alive. Speaking on the 35th anniversary of the signing of the treaty by the US president, Ronald Reagan, and Soviet general secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, Zakharova said: The INF treaty had an indefinite life and was able to provide predictable restraint in the missile sphere for many years to come. Russia has claimed that its proposed safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was to “stop Ukrainian shelling”. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, made the comments this morning, according to Reuters. Both sides have accused each other of shelling the plant, which is Europe’s biggest nuclear power station. There are fears the attacks could cause a nuclear accident. Russia seized it shortly after its invasion in February. The International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog has called for a demilitarised safety zone around the plant. The Red Cross has visited Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war in the past week, and it hopes that inspections can become more frequent. Since the Russian invasion the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has seen hundreds of prisoners on both sides of the conflict. However its president, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said access had been “sporadic”. “My expectation is that these visits lead to more regular access to all prisoners of war,” the statement cited Spoljaric Egger as saying, according to Reuters. “While the recent visits are important progress, the ICRC must be granted unimpeded access to see all prisoners of war repeatedly and in private, wherever they are held.” The ICRC carried out a two-day visit to Ukrainian PoWs this week, according to Reuters. It also visited Russian PoWs last week. The UN human rights office said in November that its monitors had not been allowed access to Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia. Ukraine has introduced new emergency power cuts as it tried to repair energy infrastructure damaged in Russian airstrikes, which the national grid operator said had caused significant supply shortages. Russia targeted power facilities across Ukraine in the latest big wave of attacks on Monday, at a time of the year when energy consumption usually rises as temperatures plunge. “As of 11:00 on 8 December, because of damage caused by missile strikes to power plants and the high-voltage network, the system has a significant shortage of electricity,” the grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said the situation was complicated by the weather, with western regions facing frost, rain, snow and strong winds that were causing wires to ice over, Reuters reports, but the most difficult situation was in eastern areas, where fighting has been fiercest. “In all regions, there is a lack of energy – up to a third of what is needed,” said Oleksandr Starukh, the governor of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-eastern Ukraine. Monday’s attacks began as emergency blackouts were due to end, with previous damage repaired. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private power producer, said there were now emergency power cuts in the capital Kyiv and the Kyiv region, in the southern region of Odesa and in Dnipro, central Ukraine. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, has increased attacks on energy facilities in recent weeks, saying strikes on vital infrastructure are militarily legitimate. Ukraine says attacks intended to cause civilian misery are a war crime. The US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has produced a paper after Vladimir Putin’s meeting with the Russian presidential council on Wednesday where he said the war in Ukraine could be a “lengthy process”. Putin struck an imperialist tone. He compared himself to Peter the Great by noting that Russia controls the Sea of Azov, which the Russian tsar also fought for. The ISW said Putin seemed unwilling to go for a temporary break in fighting to regroup, as the Nato secretary general had suggested the Kremlin may look to do. “The Russian military is continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and is – so far -denying itself the operational pause that would be consistent with best military practice. “Putin’s current fixation with continuing offensive operations around Bakhmut and elsewhere is contributing to Ukraine’s ability to maintain the military initiative in other parts of the theater. Ukraine’s continued operational successes depend on Ukrainian forces’ ability to continue successive operations through the winter of 2022-2023 without interruption,” the paper said. The report’s authors added that there appeared to be friction in the Belarusian military over Russian attempts to pressure them into joining the war. “[The] ISW continues to assess that Belarus is highly unlikely to enter the war in Ukraine due to domestic factors that constrain Lukashenko’s willingness to do so.” Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, is in Zaporizhzhia, from where he has filed this dispatch as fighting intensifies in southern Kherson. The people of Nova Kakhovka on the east bank of the Dnipro River had grown accustomed to constant shelling, but in recent days they have been hearing machine gun fire as the war draws closer to what could be its next major battlefield. Despite predictions that the conflict would slow down in the winter months, civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia through the last open crossing point on the frontlines say the fighting is escalating in southern Kherson region as Ukrainian forces seek to keep the Russians on the retreat towards Crimea and beyond. “It has been machine guns lately, not artillery,” said Anna, a 78-year-old from Nova Khakovka after arriving at a police checkpoint in Zaporizhzhia. “The windows were shaking, the house was shaking. We were afraid that everything could collapse at any moment.” Read more: Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow would keep to its moratorium on deploying intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, as long as the US did not deploy such weapons in Europe or Asia. “The moratorium is still in place, but if such weapons are deployed by the United States on European or Asian territory, our approach cannot remain unchanged,” Ryabkov told the Rossiya 24 news channel according to Reuters. He made similar comments a year ago. The UK Ministry of Defence has published its daily update on the situation in Ukraine according to its intelligence sources. It said Russia had an “almost continuous trench system” for a 60km (37 miles) stretch between Svatove in Luhansk oblast and the Russian border. The MoD added, however, that the depth of the defence remained “unclear”. Svatove is a small city to the north of Luhansk city. The region has been occupied since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. The MoD said Russia’s 1st Guards Tank Army is partially deployed near Svatove but the “supposedly elite” group took heavy casualties earlier in the war, including in the retreat from Kharkiv in September 2022. “It has now been partially reinforced with mobilised reservists, although remaining well below its authorised strength of over 25,000 personnel,” the update added. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Europe lacked “critical defence capabilities” at the annual conference of the European Defence Agency on Thursday. Addressing attendees he said it made Europe vulnerable to “higher-level threats”. His comment echoes a recent remark by the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin, who said “Europe isn’t strong enough” without the US. Here is the clip: As Christmas approaches, Ukrainian authorities are taking extra steps to try to create a festive feeling despite the conflict. In Kharkiv, which was occupied by Russian troops earlier this year, a tree has been erected in a subway to protect it from artillery or missiles. Russian forces are trying to use locals in Zaporizhzhia to fight for their army to replace Russian personnel who have been killed. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in the Russian-occupied region, the authorities have issued summonses to men of conscription age in Melitopol. “The Russian occupiers plan to mobilise local residents in order to replenish current losses,” the update said. The Ukrainian army has killed another 340 Russian troops in the last 24 hours. More than 93,000 Russian personnel have been killed since 24 February, a post on Facebook by the general staff of the armed forces said. Battles on 8 December also led to the loss of two Russian battle tanks, two armoured combat vehicles and two artillery systems. A further two drones, which have been used to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure and residential areas, were shot down. These are figures provided by the Ukrainian side, which have not been verified by the Guardian. Russia’s published statistics show much lower numbers of losses. • The original key event headline on this blog entry has been corrected to make clear it was 93,000 Russian troops Ukraine is claiming have been killed. A Ukrainian pilot who shot down two missiles and five drones before ejecting from his plane has been awarded the Hero of Ukraine, the order of the Gold Star. Maj Vadym Voroshylov carried out the operation over the Vinnytsia oblast on 12 October, before ejecting from his jet after it had been damaged. A photo of him has been circulated on the internet in Ukraine this week, as he took a photo of himself bloodied but defiant afterwards, giving a thumbs-up to the camera. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy approved a government decree on Monday giving him the honour, in recognition of his service. Before I hand you over to my colleague, Harry Taylor, here are some of the latest snaps to come out of Ukraine today. The number of oil tankers waiting in the Black Sea to cross Istanbul’s Bosphorus strait on the way to the Mediterranean rose by five to 16 on Thursday, a shipping agency said, according to a Reuters report. Talks are continuing between western and Turkish officials on steps to resolve the tanker queues after new restrictions were rolled out aimed at Russian oil exports. The G7 group of countries, the European Union and Australia agreed to bar shipping service providers like insurers from helping export Russian oil unless it is sold at an enforced low price, or cap, to deprive Moscow of wartime revenue. But a separate Turkish measure in force since the start of the month has caused a logjam, requiring vessels to provide proof they have insurance covering the duration of their transit through the Bosphorus strait or when calling at Turkish ports. The Tribeca shipping agency named five new tankers longer than 200m waiting north of the Bosphorus strait to cross southbound towards the Mediterranean Sea, in addition to the 11 named a day earlier. It said no ships were scheduled to cross. At the Dardanelles strait further south, nine tankers were waiting to cross southbound, down from 12 a day earlier, the agency said. Three tankers were scheduled to pass through that strait on Thursday, two en route from Tuapse in Russia to Fujairah in the UAE and one en route from Tuzla in Turkey to Sidi Kerir in Egypt. Russian troops are reportedly taking part in tactical exercises in Belarus, according to the Russian defence ministry. Belarus has said it will not enter the war in Ukraine, but President Alexander Lukashenko has in the past ordered troops to deploy with Russian forces near the Ukrainian border, citing threats from Kyiv and the west. In a statement cited by Reuters, Russia’s defence ministry said: Servicemen of the Western Military District ... continue intensive combat training on the ranges of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus … Combat training events are held during both daylight and at night. Servicemen are shooting from all types of small arms, as well as from mortars; they hone their skills in driving combat vehicles, pass psychological obstacle courses, study tactical medicine and other disciplines.” Video clips posted by the ministry showed Russian soldiers in snow gear training near tanks in a winter landscape, firing weapons including artillery. Ukraine used domestically-modified Soviet drones to strike Russian bases hundreds of miles from its border, according to a recent Politico report. The drones reportedly struck two military airbases in Russia killing three Russian service members and damaging two airplanes earlier this week. The drones used in the attack, according to two people familiar with the operation who spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, were modified Tu-141 surveillance aircraft left over from the Soviet era. “The key success factor was a surprise. Russia just did not expect anything of this sort,” said one of the individuals, who works with the Ukrainian government. “Now they will be prepared.” Ukraine has for months requested long-range missiles and drones from its western allies, but have so far been refused. Russian forces have fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, which is still working despite taking major damage, Interfax Ukraine news agency cited a senior official as saying on Wednesday. Volodymyr Kudrytsky, chief executive of the Ukrenergo grid operator, also told a meeting arranged by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that his officials were scouring the world for the complex equipment needed for repairs. Eight recent waves of Russian air strikes on critical infrastructure have seriously damaged the grid and led to emergency and planned outages across the country. Interfax Ukraine cited Kudrytsky as saying: These attacks represent the biggest blow to a power grid that humanity has ever seen. More than 1,000 shells and rockets were fired at electrical facilities and lines, including substations.” Ukraine now has a serious shortage of generating capacity, even though consumption is down between 25% and 30% compared to the pre-war period. The system is still working, it is integrated, not broken or disconnected,” Kudrytsky said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later said Ukraine was increasing the electricity supply every day but noted problems in Kyiv and several other regions. “We should not forget ... that it is impossible to restore 100% of the energy system, as it was before the beginning of the Russian energy terror,” he said in an evening video address. “Time is needed. That is why scheduled blackouts continue in most of the cities and districts,” he continued. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy provided a battleground update in his latest national address on Wednesday evening. Regarding the Donetsk region, Bakhmut districts and other hottest spots. A very fierce confrontation is ongoing there, every metre counts.” Zelenskiy also noted Russian forces made a “brutal, absolutely deliberate strike” on Kurakhove, also in the Donetsk region. The strike reportedly killed ten people. Today [Wednesday] the Russian army carried out a very brutal, absolutely deliberate strike at Kurakhove. Precisely at civilians. At ordinary people. At the market, elevator, gas station, bus station, residential building. The list of the dead so far includes ten people, there are many wounded.” The US has denounced “loose talk” on nuclear weapons after Russian President Vladimir Putin mused on rising risks of nuclear war but said Moscow would not strike first. Putin hinted that “such a threat is rising” during a Kremlin meeting on Wednesday but assured that “Russia will under no circumstances use them first”. US State Department spokesman Ned Price, asked about Putin’s remarks, declined to reply directly but said: We think any loose talk of nuclear weapons is absolutely irresponsible.” Price said that nuclear powers around the world since the Cold War, including China, India, the United States and Russia itself, have been clear that “a nuclear war is something that must never be fought and can never be won.” We think any other rhetoric – whether it is nuclear saber-rattling or even raising the spectre of the use of tactical nuclear weapons – is something that is irresponsible,” Price said. It is dangerous, and it goes against the spirit of that statement that has been at the core of the nuclear non-proliferation regime since the Cold War.” US officials have voiced fear that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it feels routed on the battlefield and could plant a fictitious story to justify its actions. Putin dedicated some of his remarks on Wednesday to questions about the potential for nuclear war, which he said was growing more likely due to the conflict with the west. This threat is increasing, I can’t deny it,” Putin said in response to a question, adding that Russia would not use those weapons first. We have not gone crazy, we are aware of what nuclear weapons are. We have these means, and they are more advanced and more modern than those of any other nuclear country. As of today, this is an obvious fact. We are not going to wave these weapons around like a razor, running around the world, but of course we act with the understanding that they exist.” Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting en masse from the field of battle, and claimed he would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said. But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian shelling killed 10 people and wounded many others in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Kyiv’s mayor Vitali Klitschko warned of an “apocalypse” scenario for the city this winter if Russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue. Russia has fired more than 1,000 rockets and missiles at Ukraine’s power grid, Interfax Ukraine news agency said. President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack.

He claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. The risk of nuclear weapons being used in the Ukraine conflict has lessened thanks to international pressure on Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview published Thursday. “One thing has changed for the time being: Russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons. In response to the international community marking a red line,” Scholz said in the interview with Germany’s Funke media group. Talks between Russia and the United States on securing an exchange of high-profile prisoners are making only sporadic progress, a top Russian diplomat said in comments published on Thursday. The two countries have been examining ways of conducting an exchange to enable jailed Americans Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan to go free. Moscow has made it known it would like convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout to be included in any deal. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the high commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T19:57:59Z","webTitle":"Ukraine accuses Russia of destroying another dam to slow counteroffensive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-destroying-another-dam-donetsk","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing a counteroffensive launched by Kyiv. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in Kherson region, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. Ukrainian forces have moved along both sides of the river, southwards from the town of Velyka Novosilka, declaring the liberation of a string of villages: Blahodatne on the east bank; and Neskuchne, Makarivka and Storozheve on the west side. On Monday night, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said three other settlements further west along the frontline – Novodarivka, Levadne in eastern Zaporizhzhia, and Lobkove in western Zaporizhzhia – had also been taken by Ukrainian forces. The armed forces have published pictures of their units holding up flags in what were claimed to be the recaptured villages. The claims could not be independently verified, but Russian military bloggers confirmed the Ukrainian advance and reported heavy fighting overnight and on Monday morning for the next village along, Urozhaine, on the east bank of the river, straddling the road south-east towards Mariupol. Valeriy Shershen, a Ukrainian military spokesperson for that sector of the front, told the Ukrainska Pravda news agency that a dam upstream along the Mokri Yaly had been blown up by occupation forces, causing flooding on both banks. Shershen said the Russian aim had been to “slow down Ukraine’s counteroffensive” but claimed it had failed. The dam appears to have been at the village of Klyuchove but its destruction could not be independently verified. On Sunday, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, celebrated the announcement of the latest village to fall, Storozheve, thanking the marines who recaptured it and adding: “It will be the same with every settlement until we liberate all Ukrainian land.” Ukrainian officials have otherwise been tight-lipped about the counteroffensive, other than to note small territorial gains around Bakhmut, on the northern Donetsk front. The villages along the Mokri Yaly River mark the first settlements to be liberated after a week of counteroffensive, and Kyiv has made much of the capture of these small villages, aware that Ukrainians are nervous after seeing videos of wrecked Ukrainian tanks and armoured vehicles from failed assaults farther west along the line, in Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian military officials have privately called for patience and pointed out they had so far not committed the bulk of Kyiv’s 12 brigade-strong western-armed assault force to the battle. “By the way, we didn’t move our main forces yet,” a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. “So there are grounds to believe in the best.” Kyiv is frustrated that western capitals have so far not pronounced verdicts on responsibility for the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Officials have pointed out that it would have been almost impossible to cause that amount of damage from external shelling to a structure designed to withstand a tactical nuclear bomb, that it must therefore have been blown up from the inside, and that the Russians had complete control of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station at the time. The Ukrainian security service has published an audio clip of what it said was two Russian soldiers talking about how a Russian sabotage unit had been responsible. Maliar said that in the wake of the disaster, Russia was moving its forces from the left (eastern and southern) bank of the Dnipro in Kherson region to other parts of the frontline. She suggested Russian forces had blown up the dam to make it much harder for Ukrainian assault troops to cross the flooded lower Dnipro, and therefore shorten the front they had to defend. Downstream of the wrecked dam, Ukrainian authorities said the flood waters were beginning to recede at up to 5cm an hour. Upstream meanwhile, the reservoir continued to drain, leaving vast expanses of mud flats and dead fish. According to officials in Kyiv, more than 72% of the reservoir’s capacity, 14,395 cubic kilometres of water, had already been lost. In Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-controlled right (northern) bank of the Dnipro across from the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the water had receded so far that it was impossible to determine its level. Ukraine’s environment minister, Ruslen Strilets, said that despite the disappearance of the reservoir, the nuclear plant had sufficient water to keep its reactor cores and spent fuel cool and prevent a meltdown. “Regarding the power plant, the water level in the plant’s ponds is stable and sufficient to meet the plant’s needs. The situation is now under control,” Strilets said in a television interview. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is due in Ukraine this week hoping to visit the plant. Grossi said on Sunday that his experts needed to check discrepancies in measurements of water levels of the reservoir."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2023/aug/12/for-the-record-observer-corrections","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-12T22:02:29Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/aug/12/for-the-record-observer-corrections","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/aug/12/for-the-record-observer-corrections","fields":{"bodyText":"• A photograph by Jane Bown captioned in last week’s edition as showing the blind and deaf disability advocate Helen Keller was in fact of the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (‘When on my travels please drop the myths.

Sundar Pichai also called for a global regulatory framework for AI similar to the treaties used to regulate nuclear arms use, as he warned that the competition to produce advances in the technology could lead to concerns about safety being pushed aside. In an interview on CBS’s 60 minutes programme, Pichai said the negative side to AI gave him restless nights. “It can be very harmful if deployed wrongly and we don’t have all the answers there yet – and the technology is moving fast. So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely,” he said. Google’s parent, Alphabet, owns the UK-based AI company DeepMind and has launched an AI-powered chatbot, Bard, in response to ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by the US tech firm OpenAI, which has become a phenomenon since its release in November. Pichai said governments would need to figure out global frameworks for regulating AI as it developed. Last month, thousands of artificial intelligence experts, researchers and backers – including the Twitter owner Elon Musk – signed a letter calling for a pause in the creation of “giant” AIs for at least six months, amid concerns that development of the technology could get out of control. Asked if nuclear arms-style frameworks could be needed, Pichai said: “We would need that.” The AI technology behind ChatGPT and Bard, known as a Large Language Model, is trained on a vast trove of data taken from the internet and is able to produce plausible responses to prompts from users in a range of formats, from poems to academic essays and software coding. The image-generating equivalent, in systems such as Dall-E and Midjourney, has also triggered a mixture of astonishment and alarm by producing realistic images such as the pope sporting a puffer jacket. Pichai added that AI could cause harm through its ability to produce disinformation. “It will be possible with AI to create, you know, a video easily. Where it could be Scott [Pelley, the CBS interviewer] saying something, or me saying something, and we never said that. And it could look accurate. But you know, on a societal scale, you know, it can cause a lot of harm.” The Google chief added that the version of its AI technology now available to the public, via the Bard chatbot, was safe. He added that Gooogle was being responsible by holding back more advanced versions of Bard for testing. Pichai’s comments came as the New York Times reported on Sunday that Google was building a new AI-powered search engine in response to Microsoft’s rival service Bing, which has been integrated with the chatbot technology behind ChatGPT. Pichai admitted that Google did not fully understand how its AI technology produced certain responses. “There is an aspect of this which we call, all of us in the field call it as a ‘black box’. You know, you don’t fully understand. And you can’t quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong.” Asked by the CBS journalist Scott Pelley why Google had released Bard publicly when he didn’t fully understand how it worked, Pichai replied: “Let me put it this way. I don’t think we fully understand how a human mind works either.” Pichai admitted that society did not appear to be ready for rapid advances in AI. He said there “seems to be a mismatch” between the pace at which society thinks and adapts to change compared with the pace at which AI was evolving. However, he added that at least people have become alert to its potential dangers more quickly. “Compared to any other technology, I’ve seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle. So I feel optimistic,” he said. Pichai said the economic impact of AI would be significant because it would impact everything. He added: “This is going to impact every product across every company and so that’s why I think it’s a very, very profound technology.” Using a medical example, Pichai said in five to 10 years a radiologist could be working with an AI assistant to help prioritise cases. He added that “knowledge workers” such as writers, accountants, architects and software engineers would be affected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2023/apr/30/lporachlinmakela-review-royal-festival-hall-london","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-30T13:45:38Z","webTitle":"LPO/Rachlin/Mäkelä review – a powerful performance of Shostakovich, Mahler and Larcher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/30/lporachlinmakela-review-royal-festival-hall-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2023/apr/30/lporachlinmakela-review-royal-festival-hall-london","fields":{"bodyText":"That the violinist Julian Rachlin could follow a knockout concerto performance with an encore as long, demanding and fabulously intense as Ysaÿe’s single-movement Sonata No 3, without skewing the balance of the rest of the concert, gives some indication of how powerful this programme was. This was an extraordinary evening from Rachlin, the London Philharmonic and Klaus Mäkelä, the 27-year-old Finn already lined up to be the Concertgebouw’s next chief conductor. Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No 1 is a long and gruelling play for a violinist but one that Rachlin seemed visibly to be enjoying even halfway through the finale. His deliberate, careful phrasing at the very beginning set the tone for a performance in which nothing was thrown away, not even in the most frenzied episodes, which Mäkelä drove hard and fast. In the long lines of the final movement Rachlin’s violin continued to sing out even as the orchestral sound swelled behind him; by the end he seemed unvanquishable. Something invincible courses through Thomas Larcher’s Symphony No 2 as well: is it the sea, fear, or the will to live? This 2016 work, subtitled Kenotaph, is a searing commemoration of the thousands of refugees who had drowned in the Mediterranean. It’s a dazzling piece of writing that manages to evoke terror with its sounds of heavy sea swell and panic with its jangling tintinnabulations, but is also almost playful in its light-handed way with references and with timbre – a fleeting touch of Bach, a wheezy accordion, rasping percussion that seems periodically to leach the pitch from the rest of the orchestra. Its scope is Mahlerian, and it sounded like a masterpiece here, Mäkelä drawing a performance of huge assurance from the LPO. Following the Larcher with the Adagio from Mahler’s 10th Symphony felt absolutely appropriate – and yet Mäkelä’s assertive approach, emphasising the angularity of its melodies, didn’t quite let it achieve transcendence. It was still moving, though, and the fact that even this piece could feel anticlimactic in context just speaks of the impact of what we had already heard."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T17:05:03Z","webTitle":"Germany to delay phase-out of nuclear plants to shore up energy security ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","fields":{"bodyText":"Germany is to temporarily halt the phasing-out of two nuclear power plants in an effort to shore up energy security after Russia cut supplies of gas to Europe’s largest economy. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Monday that the power plants, Neckarwestheim in Baden Württemberg and Isar 2 in Bavaria, are to be kept running longer than planned in order to be used as an emergency reserve until the middle of next year. Habeck said that after a stress test carried out with four grid operators, considered worst-case scenarios, they had come to the conclusion that “hourly crisis-like situations in the electricity supply system during winter 22/23, while very unlikely, cannot be fully ruled out”. He insisted that Germany had “very high supply security” and that the two nuclear plants should remain “on standby until mid-April 2023, in order, if necessary, to provide an additional contribution to the electricity grid in southern Germany”. The nuclear power plants would be available for operation, and fully staffed, but only on standby and would not produce electricity unless it was deemed necessary. He insisted that Germany would continue to stick by its plans – regulated by law – to withdraw from nuclear power. The plants were due to be mothballed by the end of December, the last of Germany’s nuclear power plants to cease working, after a dramatic 2011 decision by Angela Merkel, the then chancellor, in reaction to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The extraordinary upending of energy markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has however led to a dramatic rethink. Power bills across the continent have been soaring in light of dwindling supplies, putting households and businesses under extreme pressure as winter approaches. The sense of urgency increased when Russia failed to turn on the fifth and last functioning turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which had carried gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. Moscow cited faults on the line, which it said were linked to the sanctions imposed on it. Discussions on extending the lifetime of the plants have triggered a heated debate in Germany, where nuclear power has been a source of controversy for decades. An announcement by Habeck, a leading figure in the anti-nuclear Green party, on restarting the plants would once have been unthinkable, but the party has come under increasing pressure, especially from its coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, to pause the phase-out. Many in the FDP hope that today’s announcement may lead to a complete rethink on the phase-out policy, arguing that nuclear power would help Germany achieve its zero-carbon emission goals sooner, as well as helping to secure long-term energy security. The Green party has rejected this position. “In the winter, our towns and cities will in part be darker because of the fact we have to save electricity. In this situation we should not forgo safer and climate-friendly ways of producing electricity such as nuclear power. This requires more than just extending their operation,” said finance minister Christian Lindner, who is head of the FDP. Already Germany had been forced to restart mothballed coal-fired power plants, considered the most environmentally damaging source of fuel, which Habeck has stressed was a temporary and painful but necessary measure. So far polls show that the majority of Germans are understanding of the need to at least temporarily revert to nuclear power, given the urgency of the situation, even if they don’t like it. Habeck has also been trying to fill Germany’s gas storage facilities, using supplies from Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. Despite Russia’s total switch-off, storage levels stood at just under 86% on Monday. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said on Monday that the failure to resume supplies from Nord Stream 1 after the impromptu maintenance work was owing to “problems with pumping gas [that] arose due to sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Extending the lifetime of the plants is, though, not expected to boost Germany’s energy supplies by much. Habeck has said they make up just 2% of Germany’s electricity output. He had repeatedly ruled out resurrecting the plants, while chancellor Olaf Scholz had said it “could make sense”. Scholz unveiled a new series of inflation relief measures on Sunday, amounting to 65bn euros and encompassing everything from a rise in child support to assistance in housing benefit to cover high energy bills.

After high-level talks in Brisbane largely focused on military cooperation, Blinken confirmed that the Australian government had raised the case with the US on multiple occasions, and said he understood “the concerns and views of Australians”. But he pointedly added that it was “very important that our friends here” in Australia understood the US concerns about Assange’s “alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of our country”. The key announcements after the meeting on Saturday included that the US would increase the “tempo” of visits of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. The US also plans to step up rotations of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and introduce new rotations of US army watercraft, while pledging to help Australia to start domestic manufacturing of missiles within two years. The US assured the Australian government that the attempts to secure congressional support for the Aukus deal remained on track, even as some Republicans push for greater funding for US production. But Blinken’s defence of the US charges against Assange will be seen as a blow to the campaign to free the Australian citizen. Assange remains in Belmarsh prison in London as he fights a US attempt to extradite him to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars as well as diplomatic cables. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, confirmed she had raised the case with the US government. At a joint press conference alongside Blinken, Wong said: “We have made clear our view that Mr Assange’s case has dragged for too long, and our desire that it be brought to a conclusion, and we’ve said that publicly and you would anticipate that that reflects also the position we articulate in private.” Wong added, however, that there were limits to what could be achieved in talks between governments “until Mr Assange’s processes have concluded”. Blinken, speaking second, told reporters that as a general matter of policy the US did not comment on extradition proceedings. “I really do understand and certainly confirm what Penny said about the fact that this matter was raised with us, as it has been in the past, and I understand the sensitivities, I understand the concerns and views of Australians,” he said. “I think it is very important that our friends here understand our concerns about this matter.” Blinken said the US Department of Justice had indicated that Assange was “charged with very serious criminal conduct”. “The actions that he has alleged to have committed risked very serious harm to our national security, to the benefit of our adversaries, and put named human sources at grave risk – grave risk – of physical harm, and grave risk of detention,” Blinken said. “So, I say that only because just as we understand sensitivities here, it’s important that our friends understand sensitivities in the United States.” Assange’s brother, Gabriel Shipton, said it was now up to the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to “put Australians’ views in front of the president himself” during a forthcoming visit to the US. “Secretary of state Antony Blinken’s snub to Australians demanding Julian’s freedom cuts deeper knowing the American who allegedly leaked the information has been free since 2017,” Shipton said. The former US military analyst Chelsea Manning’s sentence was commuted by the Obama administration in 2017. An adviser to the Australian Assange Campaign, Greg Barns, also responded to Blinken’s comments. “Australia is the US’s closest ally,” Barns said. “Mr Blinken needs to understand the overwhelming view of Australians which is that enough is enough. Julian must be released immediately and be able to rejoin his family.” Australian federal politicians from across the political spectrum wrote to the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, in April to argue that case “set a dangerous precedent” for press freedom and would damage the reputation of the US. The 48 MPs and senators, including 13 from the governing Labor party, said the charges – which include 17 counts under the Espionage Act and one count under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act – pertained to Assange’s actions “as a journalist and publisher” in publishing information “with evidence of war crimes, corruption and human rights abuses”. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has argued the prosecution of Assange “imperils journalism everywhere and undermines the United States’ reputation as a safe place for press freedom and free speech”. Blinken and Wong were joined by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, for annual talks known as Ausmin. The meeting was overshadowed by an Australian defence force helicopter training accident near Queensland’s Hamilton Island on Friday night that left four crew members missing. Marles, the deputy prime minister, said at the outset of Saturday’s talks that they were meeting “with heavy hearts”, with a search for the four members continuing, while Blinken said: “We’re thinking of them, we’re thinking of their family, their friends, comrades.” As dozens of Republicans in the Senate flex their muscle on Aukus legislation on Capitol Hill – demanding extra funds to boost US domestic production – Marles said he and Wong were “both legislators” and “very much understand the heat and light that comes with the passage of legislation”. “We are absolutely assured by Tony and Lloyd, but also in fact by the efforts that we’ve undertaken ourselves, in speaking with those on the hill, that there is a bipartisan commitment to Australia acquiring the capability to operate nuclear-powered submarines,” Marles said. Austin defended the adequacy of the US level of investment into its own submarine production, but did not rule out considering an increase in funds: “We will continue to make sure that all the pieces are in place as we proceed.” He said the US had committed to “help Australia produce guided multiple-launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, by 2025”. “We’re racing to accelerate Australia’s access to priority munitions through a streamlined acquisition process,” Austin said. “We’re also thrilled to announce that we’re taking steps to enable Australia to maintain, repair and overhaul critical US source munitions.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T23:01:43Z","webTitle":"Police watchdog for England and Wales demands new powers amid trust crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of the police inspectorate in England and Wales has demanded sweeping new powers to compel police forces to tackle what he described as the worst crisis in law and order in living memory. In his first annual assessment as head of His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS), Andy Cooke said there was a limited opportunity to restore public trust in police before it was irreparably damaged. “Public trust in the police hanging by a thread,” Cooke said. He said the crisis in public confidence in the police was partly due to a series of “dreadful scandals” including the murder of Sarah Everard by the serving Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens and the 48 rape convictions of David Carrick, another Met officer. Such scandals could have been tackled earlier if the HMICFRS had the power to compel forces to follow its recommendations rather than relying on the current system of voluntary compliance, Cooke said. He expressed frustration at repeated failures of police forces, including the Met, to act on police inspectorate warnings first raised in 2016 over officers abusing their positions with victims for sexual purposes. “In those seven years, we’ve had some truly horrendous acts by police officers,” he said as he launched the report. “I’m not saying that wouldn’t have happened if they’d done our recommendations earlier. But if I could direct around those issues, as opposed to recommending, a lot more would have been done a lot quicker.” He added: “Too often we’ve seen forces failing to act, or not acting quickly enough, to address our recommendations.” Cooke urged the government to introduce legislation to make it a legal requirement for police forces to follow directions from the inspectorate on issues of public safety. His report also demands a role for HMICFRS in the recruitment of chief constables and other senior officers to improve the calibre of police chiefs. He called for “substantial reform” of police vetting and recruitment processes, “including for chief officers”. Cooke said too much police time was being wasted filling gaps left by cuts to public services. He endorsed a plan by the Met to stop attending emergency mental health calls. “So much of policing time has been diverted to other parts of a broken system … it takes time a way from catching criminals,” he said. “Many of these other public services are under financial pressure, too, and can’t meet their own demand. For example, in 2022 the police attended 600,000 incidents relating to mental health … It is not the job for policing to treat mental health.” Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, a force he joined in 1985, said: “I can’t recall a time when the relationship between the police and public was more strained than it is now.” He complained of a “stark decline” in offences bought to justice, with the charge rate falling by two-thirds since 2015. “The police aren’t helped by a system of policing funding which is not fit for purpose and a criminal justice system which is dysfunctional and defective,” he said. He pointed out that the backlog of crown court cases had reached record levels last October. Cooke said such “widespread systemic failings” also damaged public trust in the police. In a wide-ranging report, Cooke insisted that stop and search was an effective way of deterring crime and showing police visibility on the street. But he said police leaders should explain why it had been disproportionally used against black people. He said: “That doesn’t mean that the police are being racist … There’s also more disproportionality for victims. It is four times more likely as a black man to be murdered than a young white man.” Cooke urged police forces to avoid political campaigns. “It is not their role to champion social change,” he said. “The police need to prioritise the issues that matter most to the public. Forces are failing to get the basics right.” The National Police Chiefs’ Council chair, Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said the report highlighted the “range of challenges in meeting the needs of communities across the UK” as well as “the dedication of officers, staff and volunteers”. “Policing must continue to do more to earn back the trust and confidence of the public, which we know has been eroded over recent years,” he added. “To do so, we remain focused on preventing crime and disorder, listening to communities’ concerns … and providing consistently high-quality services in responding to emergencies, investigating crime and keeping people safe. “The report also rightly recognises the pressure on the criminal justice system and mental health services and the serious impact this has for society in accessing justice and care.” Suella Braverman, the home secretary, welcomed the report, saying: “I equally share his concern that policing needs strong leaders, a greater focus on the basics and issues that matter most to the public – and to be more visible in communities. “This is why I’ve been calling for common sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/aug/09/tv-series-like-oppenheimer-manhattan-where-to-watch-stan","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-08T15:00:32Z","webTitle":"Before Oppenheimer, there was Manhattan: this underrated drama is a must-see","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/09/tv-series-like-oppenheimer-manhattan-where-to-watch-stan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/aug/09/tv-series-like-oppenheimer-manhattan-where-to-watch-stan","fields":{"bodyText":"Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer may have set off some existential crises and Wikipedia binges, but before that there was Manhattan. When the show launched in 2014, Mad Men was ending and television networks were looking for other historical dramas that would capture that same audience; those with a predilection for character-driven stories with a cerebral bent, an emotional anchor and stylish production. Edged out by more zeitgeisty shows such as The Americans and Halt and Catch Fire, Manhattan was criminally underwatched and was cancelled after two seasons in 2015. But with the success of Oppenheimer, now’s the time to consider trying Manhattan – but go in knowing you should not expect to learn the ins and outs of nuclear fission or second world war geopolitics with any robust fidelity. Manhattan is a (very) fictionalised telling of the drama, secrecy and breakthroughs of the Los Alamos nuclear bomb project. Most of the characters are not real but loosely drawn from real-world counterparts; the only two actual scientists to pop up in the show are J Robert Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr. General Groves, played by Matt Damon in Oppenheimer, is only sometimes referenced. Manhattan instead tells the story of life on “the hill”: those working and living in the secretive Los Alamos compound. It’s a rich tapestry of the triumphs and failures of the teams charged with creating a superweapon to stop the deranged dictator laying waste to Europe. Initially framed as a rivalry between the promising young physicist Charlie Isaacs (Australian American actor Ashley Zukerman, who you may recognise as Succession’s Nate Sofrelli) and the esteemed but authority-challenging Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey), Manhattan’s 23 episodes had the time and space to dive deep into the thorny moral quandaries of what it means to work for a greater good. The ethical dilemma of creating such a weapon and its appalling potential is never far from the surface. But perhaps where it’s most compelling is in its commitment to its wider ensemble. There’s Charlie’s wife Abigail (Rachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel), a woman from a rich family whose unhappiness in her marriage leads her to explore other ventures. There’s Frank’s wife Liza (Olivia Williams), a doctor and botanist who had to sacrifice her career for her husband’s work but who is unwilling to sit idly and play house. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning There are the other scientists on the hill, including Helen Prins (Katja Herbers), a Dutch physicist constantly fighting against the constraints placed on her as a woman, and Reed Akley (David Harbour), Frank’s competition working on an opposing project. Manhattan deftly services the personal dramas of its characters along with their professional challenges while throwing in doses of intrigue, espionage and military power plays. The West Wing’s Richard Schiff recurs as an intelligence officer, while CSI’s William Petersen joins in season two as a hardman and proselytising general. (Speaking of West Wing alumni, Manhattan’s directors include Thomas Schlamme, Christopher Misiano and Bill D’Elia.) The show, created by Sam Shaw (Masters of Sex, Castle Rock), tries to hit many notes, and while it’s not always perfect – I’d say it starts off shaky and doesn’t hit its stride until episode four – it skilfully weaves together the paranoia, hope and exhaustion of a moment in history which changed the world. The writing and the performances are excellent – so if Oppenheimer wasn’t enough for you, Manhattan is a dynamite series. Manhattan is streaming on Stan.

From contraception to HPV vaccines to the politics of pain relief in childbirth, much of what many of us “know” comes from old wives’ tales, fleeting appointments with GPs or advice from tipsy aunts. For every enlightened pal who lets you know some side-effects your doctor didn’t mention, there is an equally ill-informed Twitter account broadcasting that the morning-after pill leaves you infertile or the pill increases the chances of your child having ADHD. With such sophistry and illusion around the facts, there’s ample space for terrible “wellness” advice, such as blaming cramps on Mercury being in retrograde or Gwyneth Paltrow selling jade eggs to insert into your vagina to “balance hormones”. Snake oil and other potentially harmful alternative treatments can get more traction when the side-effects of progesterone are ill-researched, black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth than their white counterparts and waiting lists for Mirena coils are, as this programme tells us, up to a year long. I remember sitting in the same room as another young mother, each doing our postpartum health centre visits, and hearing the copper coil and the Mirena coil explained to her as exactly the same. As a long-term Mirena coil user, who at one point had periods so agonising my vision would blur, I wanted to scream to her: “One will probably make your periods lighter or disappear and the other will likely make them heavier and more painful!” There are reasons to go with a copper coil, but there are significant differences that are outlined in detail by one of the nurses interviewed by Davina McCall in this documentary. Unlike her, I kept this information to myself and said nothing to the stranger. Now, years later, I can’t help but imagine how justifiably angry she would feel watching Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution. It’s a one-off documentary looking at the current state of contraception in the UK. McCall had a terrible time on the pill herself as a teenager, and having seen one daughter go through something similar while her other daughter was absolutely fine, she investigates just what choices are available to us, why the information about them is so unreliable and why accessing the best options for our physical and mental health is a minefield. McCall talks to medical experts, politicians, researchers and regular people about the consequences of contraception. Even though many of them give hugely helpful information, and McCall goes so far as to be filmed having her own Mirena coil replaced on camera – talking us through the experience including the brief moments of discomfort – there are still glaring holes in the research that she cannot compensate for. McCall’s doctor explains that there is only limited research on the side-effects for some contraceptives – from weight gain to loss of libido to volatile mood swings – as they are regarded as acceptable consequences for women to endure for birth control. The documentary features some heartbreaking testimony from those who started the pill only to be overcome by depression, leaving their relationships and careers in disarray. Others who couldn’t bear it any longer resorted to unreliable fertility tracking apps, which led to unwanted pregnancies. In the middle of a mental health crisis, it’s shocking to hear how little we know about the ramifications of these medications on depression and anxiety when these people can testify to these drugs causing a seismic shift in their mental state. Unlike in Europe, the doctor explains that women in the UK have to work the system if they want to be prescribed anything other than the cheapest contraception (the combined pill microgynon) and to get an alternative, such as a coil, an implant or simply a different pill. While NHS doctors can prescribe the Mirena coil as a treatment for painful periods, this doctor tells McCall that she isn’t commissioned to do it simply because a patient wants effective contraception. These hard-to-swallow truths are ones that Pill Revolution tries to present in as palatable a way as possible. McCall is as charming and smiley as ever, at one point donning a sparkly red gown to create a camp, miniature gameshow within the programme. There are “true or false” rounds about popular contraception myths and a spinning roulette wheel where literal guinea pigs get to “win” the many possible symptoms from taking the pill. But McCall also demonstrates her skill as an interviewer capable of shifting into a more serious mode. When she meets Maria Caulfield, the minister for women’s health strategy, she holds her to account. The minister comes off as defensive and keen to spin the appearance into a showcase of her plan to fund women’s health hubs – where contraception advice and treatments will be available – and assure McCall that £25m has been allocated to make this a reality. McCall responds firmly: “That sounds like a lot of money, but when you’ve cut a billion pounds from health, and lots of that would have been used for sexual and reproductive health, putting £25m back in, it feels like a drop in the ocean.” As she leaves the interview, McCall is noticeably deflated. “It’s one step forward after many steps backwards.” There are some glaring gaps in the narrative. Class, race and disability aren’t really broached when it comes to access and care. Nor does the programme dive into the fact that some of the issues around contraception access are rooted in a desire to suppress women’s sexual freedom. But it is still a powerful documentary that will leave many viewers making more informed decisions about their bodies, saving them from pain – and potentially saving lives as well. And if the woman from the health centre is reading this, I’m sorry I didn’t yell. • Davina McCall’s Pill Revolution was on Channel 4 and is available on More4 • This article was amended on 9 June 2023 to clarify that it was one doctor’s comment on prescribing the Mirena coil and not NHS guidelines."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2023/jul/21/emily-blunt-women-pressured-oppenheimer","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-21T04:00:33Z","webTitle":"Emily Blunt: ‘Women are still pressured to be warm and likable.

Then the lead fell ill. Could she learn The Caucasian Chalk Circle overnight? No need! “She was already off-book,” says her sister, Felicity Blunt. “Em had been watching the whole time in rehearsal, not gossiping like everyone else.” Felicity, 17 months her senior, is a literary agent. When she reads manuscripts, she says: “If I’m thinking: ‘Is it good?’ it’s not good. If it’s great, you can’t stop thinking about it.” Such was the case seeing her little sister smash Brecht in the gym that night. “It was just incredible. She made it look so easy.” The drama teacher was also floored. “It was very, very impressive,” says Alfred Bradley, now retired, but still in touch with his former pupil. “A really mature performance for one so young.” When the curtain fell, he was mobbed by people asking why he hadn’t cast her in the first place. He should have, he says. Even then, “she had a mission, a focus and a fortitude” rare among adults, let alone children. He can still picture her “ready, crouching in the wings”, before a crowd scene in Twelfth Night. “Those big, blue eyes incredibly alive to what was going on.” She had just turned 11. Blunt is now 40 and the biggest British female movie star of her generation: currently pipping Knightley and Mulligan; a natural successor to Weisz and Winslet. You can trace the lineage back further – some Dench deprecation, a little Mirren wither. A very shredded Maggie Smith. In her new movie, she plays another early starter. Kitty Puening was a botanist and one-time US Communist party campaigner who had four husbands before she was 30, the last of whom was Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan’s huge and chewy new drama shows how Kitty sustained Robert through his development of the weapon in remotest New Mexico and during a later campaign to smear him for espionage. Yet she was far from your cookie-cutter supportive spouse (sample line: “The brat is down! Where are the martinis?”). “There was something flighty and wild and nonconformist about her,” says Blunt. “It was a time where contortions were happening to women, as they tried to kind of mould themselves into perfect housewives. But Kitty was a terrible mother and she wasn’t a very good housewife – and had no desire to be one.” Simmering in a pinny was a fate shared by “a lot of women with great minds – that brilliant brain gone to waste at the ironing board. I know so many women of a certain age who are angry at their lives being defined by being someone’s mummy or someone’s wife. And I have empathy for that. It’s OK that that’s not enough for them.” Blunt is speaking over video, two miles down the road. It is the final day of the Oppenheimer press tour; in fact, it is the final day of press for actors in the Sag-Aftra union for the foreseeable. The air is hectic, the schedule scrambled. The premiere that evening has been moved forward an hour so its cast can walk the red carpet without crossing a picket line. She is pro-strike: “I am a big believer in unions getting exactly what they want.” She is also pro-resolution: “I’m a huge believer in getting our crews back to work – the people who will suffer most.” For Blunt, the industrial action is also quite well timed. A few weeks ago, she mentioned in a podcast that she was taking a year off to spend with her daughters, Hazel, nine, and Violet, six, and her husband, the actor and film‑maker John Krasinski. Actually, she says, that has been overplayed: “I’m not quitting Hollywood. It’s OK, guys. Just taking a little bit of downtime.” But she does want to make the most of motherhood before they are teenagers – “I adore babies and children” – a feeling channelled into recent hits such as the Mary Poppins sequel and two Quiet Place thrillers. Kitty, meanwhile, according to Oppenheimer’s biography, “had absolutely no intuitive understanding of children”. There are multiple scenes of her being frosty towards inconsolable tots. Particularly stressful to shoot was one showing the couple driving home with their two-year-old, Peter. The young actor was “distraught, kicking off, screaming, so clingy with his mum, just exhausted. Snot pouring out of his nose.” As the cameras reloaded, Blunt sang him to sleep. They did four further takes, with the child conked out in her arms. Nolan chose the first version, “where I looked like the worst mother in the world”. Over the phone, he grins at the memory: “It was hard. Emily is an amazing mother and made this child feel immediately so comfortable and loved. I’m not sure Kitty shared that.” In fact, his film blunts Kitty’s claws. According to the book, she left both babies with friends for months. Oppenheimer died alone because his wife found his final-hours regression to infancy “pitiful”. “Just horrific,” says Blunt. “She was pretty ruthless in so many ways. She worshipped Robert, but also really called him on all his shit.” Still, Blunt gamely attempts empathy. Perhaps some people are just allergic to weakness? And don’t label Kitty an alcoholic: surviving on cigarettes and martinis at Los Alamos was understandable, she says. Plus, Robert’s genius got him a free pass denied to his wife. His gender, too? “Yes, I think so. I wonder what the world would feel if it was Kitty Oppenheimer who created this bomb.” When he was writing the film, says Nolan, “I thought about running away from Kitty. She is a frightening character.” He recruited Blunt to “humanise” her, then was surprised how keenly she embraced Kitty’s worst angles: “No vanity, no fear of humiliation, no wanting to control the way she would appear.” In her mid-20s, Blunt told this paper that “bitchy gets boring” – a line, she says today, from a time when she was “still working out how to talk to journalists”. It is a good one. Back then, fresh from breakthroughs in My Summer of Love and The Devil Wears Prada (“Such a cow, but terribly funny and likable,” says Bradley), Blunt was worried about typecasting. But over the past 15-odd years, she has leaned into women with acid tongues and hearts of flint: the bruised FBI agent in Sicario; Tom Cruise’s relentless survival trainer in Edge of Tomorrow; the vengeful mother in The English. Even softer outings, such as The Girl on the Train (gaslit drinker) and The Young Victoria (rare corset), climax in shows of steel. In this autumn’s Pain Hustlers, she plays a hardscrabble single mother who shuts her eyes to the effects of the fentanyl she is helping to distribute. Maybe bitchy is just richer? For female actors, she says, “I think there is still a pressure to be likable, and sort of warm and understood, and men are not held to that same standard. No one cared if Leonardo DiCaprio was likable in The Wolf of Wall Street.” In Oppenheimer, Kitty attacks Robert for being “so fucking gentlemanly”. Are women, broadly speaking, more forthright? Yes, says Blunt, “but I could equally generalise and say a lot of women tend to try to dance around things because we’re not often given a platform to speak honestly. Or you’re considered too ambitious or emotional if someone appears to be speaking their mind with spirited opinion.” Kitty was revolted by her husband’s desperation to atone for his sins. “She just wanted him to own it. You see that explosion of frustration and rage start to build. I remember Chris saying to me: ‘She’s wild, she’s unpredictable, the drinking is now out of control, but she’s right!’ And she was always right, and she knew it.’” Blunt likes righteous anger. She is great at flashing eyes and squashed small talk. “I’m always really awestruck by people who are so completely comfortable in their own skin and uncompromisingly own who they are,” she says. “People for whom there’s nothing blurry about their conviction of themselves.” Kitty’s husband may have been the flakier half of the marriage, yet it was he who was elevated to role of quasi-messiah, with acolytes to wow and, sometimes, exploit. Has anyone ever captivated Blunt like that? She thinks for a few seconds. Nolan, she says – inevitably, but convincingly: “I’ve never met anyone as authoritative. When he walks in, the air changes in the room.” (He is duly flattered: “You want to be held in high regard by Emily. Her opinion matters.”) Who else? Malala Yousafzai, she says. This also feels genuine, if a no-brainer. “I was blown away by her serenity and sweetness after so much trauma.” (Yousafzai, too, is touched to make the cut and emails to say she was struck by Blunt’s calmness: “The first time we met we had tea and talked for a long time. She just puts you at ease.”) Anybody else? Felicity. “So devastatingly brilliant and funny. She continues to be such a vital presence in my life. A source of such comfort and ease.” Such choices suggest Blunt is not someone easily swayed by false prophets. They are also one of the reasons I ring her sister (plus, because of the strike, no actors are available). I read the quote back to her. Felicity splutters. “That is probably the most extraordinary compliment anybody will ever manage to pay me,” she says. “That’s really more moving than I was expecting from this call. I’m gonna kill her! How dare she embarrass me like that?” The sisters grew up in Roehampton, a leafy south London suburb, and attended Ibstock Place, then a small private school that promoted learning through play. Their parents – Oliver, a QC, and Joanna, a former actor – had the girls and then, a decade later, two more children. The timing cemented their bond. “We were fellow travellers through all the big moments,” says Felicity. “New school, puberty, first boyfriends, no boyfriends, first jobs, no money, first hangovers. She’s always been there.” Their dependency is mutual, she says. At Emily’s 40th this year, Felicity said in her speech: “I wouldn’t know how to be me without you.” In their late teens, they rented a flat in Edinburgh, “which is where we really fell in love with one another”. Emily was in a school play they had taken to the festival. It got her an agent, then the agent got her a role in a Peter Hall production in the West End as Judi Dench’s granddaughter. Film roles swiftly followed. Looking back, says Felicity, it was very swift: no drama-school buffer, solo in Los Angeles at 19. “She had to be so independent from such a young age,” she says. “At the time, it seemed fine. Now, I look back and think: ‘Jesus Christ!’ And she’s sane! That’s amazing.” The sisters separately tell me they share a secret language. Felicity clarifies: mostly, it is just knowing what the other is thinking. But they do also call each other “Slothy” and converse in cod-Mrs Doubtfire accents: “Deeply irritating for other people. But our husbands are incredibly indulgent about it because thankfully they happen to love both of us.” Felicity met her husband, Stanley Tucci, at Emily’s wedding in 2010 (at George Clooney’s place on Lake Como in Italy). That the two main adults in her life are very famous gives her unusual authority on how that can affect people: “I’m endlessly glad I get to go to the bathroom and not be followed.” She talks of “bodyguarding” Tucci when they are out with their children; of the ways social media is “such a strange and murky part of being a public figure”; and of “watching and learning from Em. She’s so careful and dextrous about how she manages the personal versus the private.” Officially, Blunt is not on social media. “But,” she says, groaning lightly, “I have been prone to getting occasionally pulled into lurking on Instagram, and it just makes you feel terrible. I don’t feel good after doing it. I don’t feel like I’ve done anything beneficial to myself. I feel a little bit wobbly. Like I’ve wasted some time.” There is a great line in the film, in which Oppenheimer tells a friend that only a fool or an adolescent would presume to understand someone else’s relationship. Today, you could add to that number every consumer of celebrity news. Blunt’s relationships – with her husband and with her ex-boyfriend Michael Bublé – have been picked over by strangers for two decades. “I have always tried to see speculation as white noise,” she says. “I’m not always successful. Sometimes it’s going to permeate.” Her policy now is resignation. “I remember someone saying to me years ago: how you relate to the issue is the issue.” Things beyond her control are less reconcilable. “I am very easily overwhelmed by the idea of the vastness of the never-ending universe,” she says. Contemplating black holes “would be the depths of hell”. She is shaky on the nuclear physics casually strewn through the movie – and uneasy about more recent technological advances: “AI unnerves me. It’s human nature to propulsively want to keep inventing new things. But do we have to put into action everything that we create? Does it better us? Or does it really start to eviscerate what it is to be human?” She leans back on the bed in her hotel room. “Sometimes I’m like: oh my God, I’m such a dusty old fart about this stuff. But I can’t wrap my head around how beneficial it will be to us, as people, in our souls.” As the strikes have highlighted, actors hate AI – Blunt, perhaps, even more than most. Her business is built on a gift for reading people; AI would make a nonsense of that. Back at school, acting boosted her confidence so much that it cured a stammer. Yet the stammer helped the drama, too. Had she been chatting, she would never have committed that Brecht epic to memory. “It might have been formative, because she learned early to observe and soak it in,” says Felicity. “My husband always tells me: ‘When a scene doesn’t work, it’s because the other person isn’t listening. They’re just waiting to say their line.’” Her sister’s trump card, she thinks, is that she pays attention: “I think she’s highly attuned and sensitive to people’s behaviour. And I also feel she knows herself and, in the best sense, likes herself. Emily goes to bed happy. She works really hard. Her children and her husband are at the centre of everything. She’s a good friend. She’s a brilliant actress. She’s loving. She doesn’t have anything to prove.” She pauses. “I think she’s the best person I know.” • Oppenheimer is in UK cinemas from 21 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T21:10:10Z","webTitle":"Thousands flee homes as collapse of dam is blamed on Russian forces","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-blowing-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-near-kherson","fields":{"bodyText":"Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and an ecological disaster has been unleashed on southern Ukraine by the collapse of a major hydroelectric dam on the Dnipro River, which Kyiv said was blown up by Russia in a desperate attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam an “environmental bomb of mass destruction” and said only liberating the entire country could guarantee against new “terrorist” acts. He blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion. “It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside, by shelling. It was mined by the Russian occupiers. And they blew it up,” Zelenskiy tweeted. “This is the largest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades.” Satellite images of the dam in the days leading up to the collapse showed it was in a worsening state. A picture from Monday this week showed part of the roadway along the top missing and apparent damage to at least one sluice gate below. CNN reported that analysis of other, lower-resolution imagery suggested the damage had occurred between 1 and 2 June. On Tuesday, damage turned to catastrophic failure. Aerial footage showed the dam missing a broad mid-section with the reservoir behind, which had been at record levels, pouring over it and roaring downstream. Towns along its path were inundated, complete houses could be seen floating away in the waters, while pets and wild animals scrambled to survive. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. He said people were being evacuated and would be taken by bus to Kherson city and then by train to Mykolaiv and other Ukrainian cities, including Khmelnytskyi, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi and Kyiv. In Kherson city, the water level rose over 3 metres over the course of Tuesday, and by mid afternoon was still rising by 6cm to 8cm every half hour in low-lying areas, according to hydrologist Larysa Musian, who was taking depth measurements on a Kherson street corner. Relief workers on the right bank of the river had to work under fire. “The biggest difficulty right now is not the water. It’s the Russians on the other side of the river who are shelling us now with artillery,” said Andrew Negrych, who was coordinating relief efforts for a US charity, Global Empowerment Mission. In Nova Kakhovka, all the animals except ducks and geese drowned, according to the animal welfare organisation Uanimals. “We tried hard to preserve the zoo during the occupation and now it no longer exists,” the group quoted the zoo management as saying. The disaster will have damaging effects that could last for generations, from the immediate potential for loss of life to the thousands of people forced to abandon their homes and farms. It is expected to have a catastrophic effect on the ecology of the region and will sweep mines from the banks of the Dnipro into villages and farmland downstream. It also robs Ukraine of long-term capacity for generating hydroelectric power. The loss of the upstream reservoir threatens water supplies to the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and Crimea, and has long-term implications for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant 120 miles (200km) upstream. Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said the hydroelectric plant and dam had been blown up at 2.50am local time (0050 BST) on Tuesday. “Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories,” Yermak told the Guardian. “Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Ukrainian hydroelectric power corporation said the dam had been destroyed by a bomb placed in one of the turbine halls on top of it. The dam collapse happened on the second day of Ukrainian offensive operations likely to mark the early stages of a mass counteroffensive. It could affect any Ukrainian plans for an amphibious assault across the river. “The purpose is obvious: to create insurmountable obstacles on the way of the advancing [Ukrainian army] … to slow down the fair final of the war,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Twitter. Rishi Sunak said if Russia was responsible for the destruction of the dam in Ukraine, it would be a “new low” for Moscow in the invasion. Speaking to reporters on board his official plane to Washington last night, the UK prime minister said: “If it is intentional it would represent the largest attack on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine since the start of the war.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he had no independent information about the circumstances of the collapse but added: “One thing is clear: this is another devastating consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, and Janez Lenarčič, European commissioner for crisis management, issued a joint statement warning the attack could be a war crime. “It represents a new dimension of Russian atrocities and may constitute a violation of international law, notably international humanitarian law,” they said. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said at a televised town hall meeting: “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension.” Local Russian authorities in the city of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling. The Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed official from the Kherson emergency services as saying the dam had collapsed from structural weakness under water pressure. Zelenskiy called an emergency meeting of his national security council on Tuesday. “Russian terrorists,” Zelenskiy said on Twitter. “The destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam only confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land. “Not a single metre should be left to them, because they use every metre for terror. It’s only Ukraine’s victory that will return security. And this victory will come. The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else.” Prokudin posted a video to Telegram in which he said that as a result of the damage to the dam, “water will reach a critical level in five hours” and that evacuations had begun. Russia’s state-run news agency Tass cited emergency services saying 80 settlements could be affected. A Russian military blogger, Rybar, said 11 out of 28 spans in the dam were destroyed after explosions at 2am, though this could not immediately be verified. Another blogger said there were no reported missile attacks on the dam before the breach, while videos circulated on Russian channels were said to be of civilians evacuating. Vladimir Leontiev, the head of the Russian-occupied administration of Nova Kakhovka city, on the southern bank of the Dnipro, initially denied the dam had been blown up, according to the Ria Novosti news agency, but he was later reported to confirm there was “damage” and blamed it on shelling. Interfax quoted an unnamed representative from regional emergency services as saying the collapse was the result of a catastrophic structural failure. “The dam could not stand it: one support collapsed, and flooding began,” the representative said, adding that there were no attacks on the hydroelectric power station overnight. Last month, it was reported that water levels in the reservoir had reached a 30-year high as the Russian occupiers had kept relatively few sluice gates open, according to experts. David Helms, a former US air force and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist who has monitored the dam, said on Twitter: “The Russians allowed the reservoir to fill to record levels; if the dam failed ‘naturally’, it certainly failed due to six weeks of over-topping and stress on the structure.” The areas most under threat from flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Earlier modelling of such a disaster suggested Kherson city would not bear the brunt, but the harbour, the docklands and an island in the south of the city are likely to be inundated. It is unclear how many people could lose their homes. There could be two further serious side-effects: the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant upstream could lose access to water for cooling as the reservoir drains away, and the water supply to Crimea could also be severely affected. Four of the six reactors at the nuclear plant are completely shut down, and two are on “hot shutdown”, producing a small amount of energy for the plant itself and the neighbouring town. The International Atomic Energy Agency said in a tweet its experts at the plant were monitoring the situation. It said there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant”. A Moscow-backed official in the Zaporizhzhia region was quoted by a Russian news agency as saying there was no “critical danger” to the plant yet. The dam, a Soviet power project, was completed in 1956 and was 30 metres high, holding back a vast reservoir of 18 cubic kilometres of water. It sits about 20 miles (32km) upstream from Ukrainian-held Kherson. Zelenskiy warned last November that Russia was plotting to blow up the two-mile structure and that doing so would cause “a large-scale disaster” affecting people living downstream."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/aug/23/my-brother-is-dying-but-eon-keeps-calling-him","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-23T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"My brother is dying but E.ON keeps calling him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/23/my-brother-is-dying-but-eon-keeps-calling-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/aug/23/my-brother-is-dying-but-eon-keeps-calling-him","fields":{"bodyText":"My younger brother was recently admitted to a hospice for end-of-life care. I hold lasting power of attorney (LPA) for him and manage his financial affairs. My brother has an outstanding electricity bill and I have asked for E.ON to send it to me for payment. I sent it the LPA document and have many times asked it to communicate through me. However, it persists in harassing my brother for payment with emails, texts and phone calls. It confuses and distresses him enormously. I’ve complained but to no avail. JF Norwich This incompetence has added immeasurably to your family’s suffering at this grievous time. The day after you wrote to me, you say E.ON called your brother twice in one day as he lay in his hospice bed. In vain have you explained his situation and provided your own contact details. It is, of course, a simple matter to rectify the problem, as E.ON discovered when I alerted its press office. Two hours later you received an email from its escalated complaints team explaining that, due to human error, your details were not added to your brother’s account after the second set of LPA documents were received. The first set was apparently mislaid on arrival. In recompense, E.ON has waived the £81.47 owing on the account. A spokesperson said: “We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and distress this has caused. We’ve given feedback to the advisers involved. We’ll also be including this as an example in future training to staff.” E.ON’s response to vulnerable customers is deeply concerning. Last month I reported on an elderly heart patient with a prepayment meter who stopped heating his home or cooking food for a year after being threatened with legal action over a £13,000 bill for a stranger’s energy, and on a mother and daughter forced out of their flat because E.ON debited their top-up payments to service the debt of a previous tenant. In June, E.ON was forced to pay £5m in compensation after the energy regulator Ofgem found “severe weaknesses” in its customer services, especially call handling. Ofgem said: “With market conditions challenging for consumers, with many facing financial difficulties, Ofgem believes it is imperative suitable customer service arrangements are in place. Failure to do so means consumers face imminent and significant harm.” Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.
