The Gambling Commission, which regulates the industry, said PPB Counterparty Services, trading as Paddy Power and Betfair, would pay £490,000 for breaching social responsibility rules. The fine relates to material sent to customers who had signed up to Gamstop, a nationwide scheme that gamblers can use to voluntarily block themselves from betting sites, often in response to concerns they may be addicted. Gambling operators are supposed to remove anyone who signs up to Gamstop from their marketing databases within two days, under the conditions of British gambling licences. But on 21 November 2021, due to “human error”, self-excluded Paddy Power customers with an Apple device were sent a notification advertising the opportunity to bet on Tottenham Hotspur v Leeds United. The Gambling Commission did not say how many people received the message. Paddy Power Betfair, owned by global gambling operator Flutter, is the latest in a string of operators to pay a penalty this year for failing to act in a socially responsible way. Previous penalties include a record £19.2m fine meted out to William Hill for “widespread and alarming” failures, including allowing customers to lose tens of thousands of pounds within minutes of opening an account. The litany of failings has emerged despite increased scrutiny on the £10bn-a-year sector, as the government drew up proposals for tighter regulation. The resulting white paper, published last month, generally envisages a crackdown on online gambling, including tougher affordability checks and limits on online slot machine stakes. But most of the proposals have been put out to a year-long consultation. Paddy Power initially appealed against a higher penalty related to its transgression, before agreeing to pay a £490,000 penalty on condition that it dropped the appeal. The company will also hire an independent third party to carry out an audit of its marketing processes. Ian Brown, chief executive of Flutter in the UK and Ireland, said: “Flutter’s ambition is to lead the industry in safer gambling and we apologise for this mistake. The push notification in question was sent in error and, once discovered by our team, we took immediate steps to rectify the issue and proactively notified the Gambling Commission.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T10:40:25Z","webTitle":"Inter claim Coppa Italia and offer City a glimpse of their knockout power | Nicky Bandini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2023/may/25/inter-coppa-italia-fiorentina-champions-league-manchester-city","fields":{"bodyText":"Lautaro Martínez had not even got his hands on the trophy and already they were asking him about the next one, his TV interviewer rushing through a conversation about the Coppa Italia Inter retained on Wednesday night to get to a question about the Champions League final in Istanbul. “I want to keep going,” said the Argentinian. “I want to keep on winning.” He has established quite a habit. In the last six months, Martínez has claimed three trophies – starting with a World Cup in Qatar last December, following up with a Supercoppa, and now the Coppa Italia. His first goal cancelled out an early deficit for Inter against Fiorentina, the second secured a 2-1 win. The Nerazzurri were favourites for this final, but anyone who imagined it to be a formality could not have been paying attention. Fiorentina beat them at San Siro in April and were drawing with them as late as the 94th minute of their previous league game. Vincenzo Italiano has shaped the Viola into a relentless, in-your-face team who navigated to the finals of this competition and the Europa Conference League. Italiano was described by one former sporting director as a “little [Pep] Guardiola” and has named the Manchester City manager as his inspiration. His Fiorentina team press from the front without the ball and build from the back with it, with centre-backs as auxiliary playmakers. Wednesday’s opening goal was an example of what it looks like when it works. Inter gave the ball away in a seemingly innocuous position and in the blink of an eye it had been advanced to Giacomo Bonaventura, who fed Jonathan Ikoné on the left corner of the box. He took one touch before nutmegging Matteo Darmian with a pass back across the area. Nico González arrived at full speed to finish on the far side. Since missing out on the World Cup triumph due to injury, Fiorentina’s Argentina winger has been making up for lost time. González’s return was instrumental in lifting his club out of a winter slump and he scored twice in the second leg of the Europa Conference League semi-final away against Basel last week, carrying them to a 5-4 aggregate win. On this occasion, however, Inter were quick to recover. Martínez equalised in the 29th minute, running on to Marcelo Brozovic’s through pass and drilling into the bottom corner. He put his team ahead in the 37th, volleying home brilliantly from Nicolò Barella’s cross. Those were his 100th and 101st goals for Inter but more importantly his ninth and 10th since the start of April – a figure bettered only by Karim Benzema and Callum Wilson in Europe’s top five leagues. The greatest criticisms of Martínez in Italy have centred on his streakiness, the way he seems to vanish for weeks at a time. When he is on form, he can look unstoppable. He was in that mode on Wednesday. Shortly before his equaliser, Martínez had shed the 6ft 5in Nikola Milenkovic like a twig catching his shoulder on a stroll through the woods, casually brushing him off before sending Edin Dzeko through on goal, only to see the Bosnian fire over the bar. Inter ought to have put the result beyond doubt. They had further chances either side of the interval, Romelu Lukaku entering the game and testing the Fiorentina goalkeeper Pietro Terracciano himself before presenting Robin Gosens with an open goal after bulldozing to the byline on the right. The German, under pressure from Dodô, could not hit the target. And then they nearly blew it. Luka Jovic, on as a 70th-minute substitute for Fiorentina, executed the smoothest of drag-backs to wrong-foot Darmian, but could not beat Samir Handanovic at the near post. The striker should have done much better moments later, when Dodô’s cross found him unmarked, but his header sailed harmlessly across the face of goal. The emotions at full time showed how much this cup meant on both sides. Several Fiorentina players were in tears, overcome with exhaustion and frustration. This was their 57th game of a marathon season, and a chance to claim a first piece of silverware since 2001. They were painfully aware of how it might have ended differently had they taken their chances in the second half. Inter, meanwhile, celebrated retaining a trophy that validates the good work they have done under Simone Inzaghi. Their league form has been disappointing this season, a team expected to challenge for the title finding itself 20 points behind the leaders Napoli with two games to play, having lost 12 out of 36 games. They have lacked consistency but believe they can be a match for anyone when their focus is right. There is something about cup competitions that seems to bring the best out of them, and especially from their manager. Inzaghi had already won the Supercoppa twice and Coppa Italia once at Lazio. In two seasons at Inter, he has a perfect record in both. The Nerazzurri have lost only a single game of knockout football out of the 20 they have played under Inzaghi: the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Liverpool last February. They won the return at Anfield but exited 2-1 on aggregate. Inter supporters may hold on to statistics such as these – another being that Inzaghi has won seven out of eight finals in his managerial career – as the Champions League showdown with Manchester City looms. The team itself cares less for statistics than the feelings of confidence that winning brings. “We know it will be really difficult,” said Hakan Calhanoglu of the final against City. “But it’s only one game. Of course we believe we can do it. We have believed ever since the start of the Champions League, after [the win against] Barcelona.” Fiorentina have a continental final of their own to come against Premier League opponents, West Ham, whose manager David Moyes was in attendance at the Stadio Olimpico. Italiano had acknowledged even before the Europa Conference League semi-final that he wanted to win that competition the most. “You can’t be defeated after a match like this one,” he said on Wednesday. “We played on a level footing with a Champions League finalist. We are really disappointed, but we will take lots of positives with us to Prague. We need to take revenge for ourselves and go there convinced we can bring that trophy home.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T22:00:06Z","webTitle":"Anthony Watson hails power of visualisation in England return","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/mar/03/anthony-watson-try-england-six-nations","fields":{"bodyText":"Anthony Watson’s try for England against Wales last week came with a sense of deja vu. An obvious feeling of cathartic release, too, after spending so long out with injury, but underlying it all, a familiarity. For Watson had scored the try before, diving into the left-hand corner and dotting the ball down with his right hand. In fact, he had done so only days earlier during one of his visualisation blocks – a preparation method the 29-year-old winger swears by. “I don’t really judge my quality of games by tries but to be able to score in the corner was nice and something I had spent a lot of the week visualising,” he says. “That is how I try to calm myself down before games. It is weird how it happened exactly how I had pictured it. Literally in that corner, because I was playing on the left wing and it was finishing with the ball in my right hand in that kind of style.” Watson has been using visualisation techniques – as both a way to prepare for matches and cope with long-term injuries – for years. It started from his work with the renowned mind coach Don Macpherson and he does it a handful of times, 20 minutes on each occasion, in the buildup to a game. An NFL fan, Watson chuckles when it is put to him how the Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers recently spent four days in a darkness retreat – “I don’t think I’m ready for that” – but techniques such as those he does use are increasingly commonplace in sport. Wayne Rooney used to talk about having a “memory” before the game and would seek out the kit man to find out what colour he would be wearing to enhance the process, and Watson believes it is of increasing importance in rugby. “It has happened a few times when I have scored,” he says. “The power of visualisation is so important. I have scored tries and it has ended up exactly how I had it in my head. It starts off with just what it would look like from a bird’s eye view and then what it would feel like for me. It all starts with my work with Don Macpherson, that stuff puts me in good stead for what lies ahead and it just calms me. That is the only time I think about the game, in those periods of visualisation. It gives me blocks, periods of allowing myself to focus on what I need to then letting it go. “It is common now. There is a greater respect for the power of mental techniques to prepare for games. Everyone is different, what will be useful for some people and completely useless for others. I just found it really helpful in terms of blocking out periods to think about the game, and it allows me to be chilled out and do whatever I want to do outside that. More and more people are finding techniques that work for them, as opposed to trying to rev up to 100 five minutes before a game. “There is value in athletes just connecting back to themselves, but things move at a million miles an hour in sport and unfortunately you can get caught up in what [the media] writes, both positive and negative. I think that sometimes it’s important to step away from that entirely and remember who you are, not what people think you are.” Watson was making his first England start for almost two years against Wales having suffered a debilitating ACL injury in October 2021 before niggling calf, hamstring and quad problems struck at the wrong time as far as international windows were concerned. The road to recovery has been difficult but visualisation has helped along the way. “It’s something that I have done a bit with long-term injuries,” he says. “More to calm me down when thoughts start spiralling, that’s when I try to go back to that kind of stuff and come back to a more relaxed mindset. Sometimes it’ll be just to calm myself down, for sure. But most of the time it’s scheduled, I’ll know if I need to do it this evening or tomorrow evening. It’s on my own. If you saw me doing it you would probably think I look crazy!” With England enjoying a training camp in Brighton during the second fallow week of the Six Nations the focus has been on continuing Steve Borthwick’s rebuild before attentions turn to France’s visit to Twickenham when they reconvene in Bagshot on Monday. So what does Watson have planned for next Saturday? He laughs and insists the script has not been finalised, but France should be wary of a player finally fit again and reaping the rewards of seeing things differently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T17:44:50Z","webTitle":"Putin’s timeline for storing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus is hard to believe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/vladimir-putin-timeline-storing-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus-is-hard-to-believe","fields":{"bodyText":"Like a lot of what Vladimir Putin says about nuclear weapons, his suggestion that Russia would start storing its bombs in Belarus may add up to less than it appears. In February last year, Putin said he was putting Russia’s nuclear arsenal on high alert, but there was no perceptible change in the country’s nuclear posture, or any unusual movements of its weapons. Putin and the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, have been hinting at some kind of nuclear basing arrangement for some time. Over a year ago, the Belarus leader staged a referendum to change the constitution to allow for that. What Putin is threatening this time is to take another couple of steps along that road, starting the training of Belarus aircrews in early April to pilot aircraft carrying nuclear bombs, and to finish storage facilities for tactical nuclear weapons by 1 July. Nuclear experts are sceptical of such ambitious timelines, and point out that Russia has been working on a nuclear weapon storage facility in Kaliningrad for at least seven years and it is still not clear whether the bombs have actually arrived there. So far, no satellite imagery has surfaced that might suggest something similar is being built in Belarus. “I’ve looked around at some of the likely bases and I don’t see anything that indicates construction of a nuclear storage site,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists. “But you can’t rule it out. You can bet a lot of people are combing over the country right now.” Putin had suggested a nuclear announcement was on the way earlier in the week, saying Russia would respond to Britain’s decision to supply armour-piercing shells to Ukraine made of depleted uranium. Such shells are toxic enough to require special handling and pose an environmental threat, but they are by no means nuclear weapons. In his remarks on Saturday, Putin did not dwell on the issue and attributed any such linkage to Lukashenko. Instead, he focused on a longstanding gripe of Moscow’s about the US nuclear-sharing arrangements with five of its allies: Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Turkey. Under that arrangement, the US stores B61 gravity bombs (about 100 in all) in those countries and their aircrews are trained to fly planes carrying them in the event of nuclear war. Russia argues this is a violation of the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and just last week, Putin’s joint statement with Xi Jinping said: “All nuclear-weapon states should refrain from deploying nuclear weapons abroad and withdraw nuclear weapons deployed abroad.” Putin’s announcement about Belarus suggests he has changed his mind about that principle since Tuesday. However, he can expect the global backlash to be muted due to widely shared impatience over many years with the US-Nato sharing arrangements. Those arrangements are not technically in violation of the NPT as they predated the treaty. The Soviet Union accepted them and at the time, Moscow could deploy its nuclear weapons in Belarus or any other of its republics. But when Belarus, Ukraine and the republics became independent, it lost that right. The US sharing deal with its allies, and the proposed Russian arrangement with Belarus, also get around NPT restrictions by not formally transferring the stored weapons to the host government until a war begins. For non-weapon states and arms control advocates, however, that is a cynical dodge and against the spirit of the NPT. The Obama administration contemplated withdrawal of the B61s from Europe as a move towards disarmament, but some European allies resisted any move that might suggest the nuclear umbrella was getting thinner, and then relations with Moscow worsened again. Rather than being removed, the bombs were modernised, and the new version, the B61-12, is in the process of being transferred to Europe. “The new bombs are a whole new wave of weapons coming in and that’s of grave concern to European populations,” said Susi Snyder, the programme coordinator of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. “Putin calling this out and threatening to do the same thing is putting a spotlight on a problem that has existed for quite some time and that the rest of the world has also been trying to draw attention to and remedy.” Kristensen argued, however, that Putin has in large part himself to blame for the continued presence of B61s in Europe, through his seizure of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014. He said: “There’s no doubt in my mind that if Putin had not started what he’s doing there in 2014, it’s very likely that the nuclear weapons would have been withdrawn by now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-26T14:14:58Z","webTitle":"Russia accused of taking Belarus ‘nuclear hostage’ with deal to station missiles there","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/26/russia-accused-of-taking-belarus-nuclear-hostage-missile-deal-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has accused Russia of destabilising Belarus and making its smaller neighbour into “a nuclear hostage”, after Vladimir Putin’s announcement that Moscow has made a deal to station tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. The country’s opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said the move “grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people” and reflected the further subjugation of Belarus under Russian control. The Russian president’s suggestions that the move would not breach non-proliferation agreements and that it was consistent with similar arrangements that the US has with several of its European allies was given short shrift in Kyiv. Oleksiy Danilov, the head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. Mykhailo Podolyak, another senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mocked Putin’s plan, saying the Russian leader was “too predictable”. “Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing &amp; all he can do is scare with tactics,” Podolyak tweeted on Sunday. Nato spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said on Sunday: “Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. Nato is vigilant and we are closely monitoring the situation. We have not seen any changes in Russia’s nuclear posture that would lead us to adjust our own. “Russia’s reference to Nato’s nuclear sharing is totally misleading. Nato allies act with full respect of their international commitments. Russia has consistently broken its arms control commitments.” Putin has repeatedly made nuclear threats or escalated nuclear rhetoric after the full invasion of Ukraine, but this is the first time he has announced a plan to station nuclear weapons in another country. The Russian president said on Saturday that he was acting after negotiations with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, who he said had “long raised the question” of a nuclear deployment on his country’s territory. Earlier in the week, Putin threatened a response to Britain’s announcement that it would supply Ukraine with armour-piercing tank shells made with depleted uranium, and mentioned the shells again in his remarks on Saturday, but his justification of the move rested mainly on the presence of about 100 US nuclear bombs in Europe. “There is nothing unusual here either: firstly, the United States has been doing this for decades,” Putin said. “They have long deployed their tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of their allied countries. We agreed that we will do the same, without violating our obligations – I emphasise, without violating our international obligations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.” Lukashenko staged a referendum in February last year, revoking Belarus’s non-nuclear status, but the opposition rejected the vote as meaningless under conditions of political repression and following the 2020 presidential election that kept him in office, generally agreed to have been rigged. “Russia’s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus directly violates the constitution of Belarus and grossly contradicts the will of the Belarusian people to assume the non-nuclear state status expressed in the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus of 1990,” Tsikhanouskaya said. “This unacceptable development, making Belarus a potential target for preventive or retaliation strikes, became possible because of the illegal seizure of power by the illegitimate regime of Lukashenko.” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Belarus it could face further sanctions if it hosted Russian nuclear weapons. “Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons would mean an irresponsible escalation and threat to European security. Belarus can still stop it, it is their choice. The EU stands ready to respond with further sanctions,” Borrell said in a tweet. Moscow has 5,977 nuclear warheads in its inventory, according to the Federation of American Scientists, and has long had the capability to strike a target anywhere in the world. The US has slightly fewer, at 5,428. The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation estimates that there are about 100 US nuclear weapons – airborne gravity bombs – stored in Europe across six bases in five countries, although they are retained in US control. The US played down concerns about Putin’s announcement and the potential for Moscow to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine. “We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon. We remain committed to the collective defence of the Nato alliance,” a senior US administration official said. The official noted that Russia and Belarus had been speaking about the transfer of nuclear weapons for some time. Analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a note late on Saturday that the risk of escalation to nuclear war remained “extremely low”. They said: “ISW continues to assess that Putin is a risk-averse actor who repeatedly threatens to use nuclear weapons without any intention of following through in order to break western resolve.” However, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons called Putin’s announcement an extremely dangerous escalation. “In the context of the war in Ukraine, the likelihood of miscalculation or misinterpretation is extremely high. Sharing nuclear weapons makes the situation much worse and risks catastrophic humanitarian consequences,” it said on Twitter. While the Belarusian army has not formally fought in Ukraine, Minsk and Moscow have a close military relationship. Minsk allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine last year and the two nations stepped up joint military training. On Sunday, Putin dismissed suggestions that Moscow was forging a military alliance with Beijing, claiming instead that western powers were building a new “axis” similar to the partnership between Germany, Italy and Japan during the second world war. “We are not creating any military alliance with China,” Putin said on state television. “Yes, we have cooperation in the sphere of military-technical interaction. We are not hiding this. Everything is transparent, there is nothing secret.” China and Russia signed a “no limits” partnership accord in early 2022, weeks before Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Beijing has refrained from criticising Putin’s decision and has touted a peace plan for Ukraine. The Russian president named Australia, New Zealand and South Korea as being in line to join a “global Nato” and referenced a defence agreement signed by Britain and Japan earlier this year. “That is why western analysts … are talking about the west starting to build a new axis similar to the one created in the 1930s by the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy and militarist Japan,” Putin said. His words reflect his ongoing attempt to suggest that Ukraine is run by Nazis and that its western supporters are hellbent on menacing Russia. Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union and was subjected to devastation at the hands of Hitler’s forces, has consistently rejected those parallels as spurious pretexts for a war of imperial conquest.

Origin Energy, owner of the 2880MW Eraring plant near Lake Macquarie, also said on Friday that “nothing had changed” on the plan to shut the coal-fired power station no sooner than August 2025. Both dismissed a News Corp report on Friday that the government had already decided to operate Eraring beyond 2025 because of delays in the construction of new generation capacity such as Snowy Hydro’s 2.0 project and transmission lines. A spokesperson for the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said all options remained on the table, as stated previously. The “arms-length” health check survey of the state’s power sector was still being worked on, the spokesperson said. “Our report is due in early August and the government will consider its response in due course.” The previous Coalition government had been in talks for about nine months over the future of Eraring prior to Origin’s closure timing announcement in February 2022. Under market rules, a generator is required to declare any plans to shut a major facility three and a half years prior to the exit from the grid. Coalition insiders have said the cost of extending even half of Eraring’s four units beyond 2025 exceeded $300m a year, excluding the cost of the coal. That sum has probably risen further since, and the new Labor government should consider better uses for the spending, they said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Origin, for its part, considered the expense would be compensated at least in part by the revenue the state would glean from selling the power. The company, one of Australia’s biggest energy firms, would also likely be among the customers to serve its own retail customers. Former and serving government officials have also said NSW’s renewable energy road map legislated by the Coalition had the flexibility to be accelerated to reduce the risk of a capacity gap should Eraring close entirely in 2025. A tender process for long-term energy storage in the form of big batteries, for instance, could be expanded. “If the firming tenders are successful, reliability will be fine,” one person familiar with the process said. That said, Sharpe has held two briefings for the media to underscore the seriousness of the state’s energy security. Major renewable energy zones, for instance, were running a couple of years behind plans, and costs were higher as governments in many parts of the world seek to accelerate decarbonisation of the power grids. Separately, one of Australia’s oldest and dirtiest power stations has said it expects to run four years longer than previously forecast. The Vales Point plant, also located near Lake Macquarie, had been slated to shut in 2029. Its new owner, Sev.en Global Investments, said in a statement it has advised the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) they plan to keep the coal-fired power station going until 2033. Built in 1978, the 1,320MW plant supplies about a 10th of NSW’s electricity. The government sold it to Delta Energy in 2015 for a $1m, and it was then on-sold last year to the Czech billionaire Pavel Tykač. “As the 2029 date draws closer, Delta has been able to estimate plant technical capabilities with a greater level of accuracy,” the company said in the statement. “Given the uncertainties surrounding the capacity of electricity resources over the next 10 years and the urgent need to maintain system security throughout this period, Delta considers it a responsible step to advise AEMO of the availability of Vales Point Power Station’s capacity,” it said. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW chief executive, Jacqui Mumford, said extending Vales Point “would make it almost impossible for NSW to reach its emission reduction targets”. “Between 2017 and 2022 this power plant averaged 6.7m tonnes of carbon emissions per year,” Mumford said. “That’s equivalent to the emissions from 2.2m cars – over half the entire passenger vehicle fleet in NSW.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/jul/14/i-had-no-power-wand-to-force-people-into-bed-kevin-spacey-tells-court","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-14T14:48:58Z","webTitle":"I had no power wand to force people into bed, Kevin Spacey tells UK court","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jul/14/i-had-no-power-wand-to-force-people-into-bed-kevin-spacey-tells-court","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/jul/14/i-had-no-power-wand-to-force-people-into-bed-kevin-spacey-tells-court","fields":{"bodyText":"Kevin Spacey dismissed sexual assault allegations against him as “absolute bollocks” as he denied waving a “power wand” to force people into bed with him. In combative exchanges at Southwark crown court on Friday, the Oscar-winning actor denied that the “crotch grab” was his “trademark move”. He also rejected claims that he used his power and influence as the “golden boy of the London theatre scene” to convince men to sleep with him. Spacey, who was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre from 2003 to 2015, told a packed courtroom: “I did not have a power wand that I waved in front of people’s faces to make them go to bed with me. I respect when people tell me they’re not interested and that’s what I’ve done my whole life.” He said that at times he was “promiscuous”, adding: “It doesn’t make me a bad person.” He continued: “I am sure if I wanted to I could have had sex all the time with lots of people, but I didn’t.” Spacey, 63, denies charges including sexual assault and indecent assault against four men in their 20s and 30s between 2001 and 2013. Three of the four complainants accuse him of aggressively groping them. Wearing a navy suit and a light blue shirt, Spacey appeared in the witness box on Friday for a second day to face questions from the prosecutor, Christine Agnew KC. She said to him: “You suggested yesterday that you’re just a big flirt but I’m going to suggest you’re wrong about that, you are just a big sexual bully.” Spacey replied: “Yes, that’s your term.” At times Spacey appeared vexed by Agnew’s comments and had to be told by the judge, Mr Justice Mark Wall, to answer her questions. During one heated exchange, the prosecutor suggested Spacey had assaulted a man he met at a West End theatre in the mid-2000s. The man has accused Spacey of groping him “like a cobra” after making a “barrage of vile comments”. Agnew suggested Spacey had “grabbed him by the crotch”. Spacey shot back: “Absolute bollocks.” Agnew continued: “Yes, because that is exactly where you did grab him, isn’t it?” “Really?” Spacey replied in apparent exasperation as he looked to the judge. Wall told him to answer the question being put to him. “Did he accuse me of grabbing his bollocks?” Spacey continued, and when the judge said “yes”, Spacey told the court: “I did not.” Agnew suggested Spacey “got turned on and decided to go for it”, and the actor replied: “You are just making it up now.” The judge told him: “You must answer the question. If the question is improper, I will stop it. Counsel is putting to you the prosecution case as to what you did and why you did it.” The judge was forced to intervene on a number of occasions, telling Spacey at one point to concentrate on his memories “rather than trying to analyse the evidence”. Responding to allegations made by an aspiring actor who has accused Spacey of drugging him before performing oral sex on him while he was asleep in his flat in the late 2000s, Spacey said: “We were in a romantic situation. I don’t know who made the first move, but we were consensually together in a romantic situation. “He did not fall asleep and I did not perform oral sex on him while he was asleep, despite what he has shockingly accused me of.” When Agnew suggested the complainant had been asleep, Spacey said: “That’s your theory.” “Well, that is the prosecution case,” Agnew responded. Spacey replied: “And it’s a weak one.” Spacey said he had a consensual “naughty” relationship with another accuser in the early 2000s. The man has claimed that on one occasion he was driving Spacey to a party hosted by Elton John when Spacey grabbed his penis with such force that he almost crashed. Spacey denied the claim, saying: “I would never have grabbed anyone’s penis so hard that they would have shouted out.” He added of their relationship: “It was somewhat sexual, but we never actually had sex and at no point did our parts emerge.” Spacey also denied grabbing the crotch of a man at his Cotswolds holiday home after meeting the complainant at a pub near Oxford in the early 2010s. “I can only tell you that we had all had a lot of drinks and, I think millions of people know what this experience is like, you make a pass at someone and you figure out you got the wrong signals and you’re embarrassed and you try to move on from that. It happens,” he said. Spacey is said to have smoked pre-rolled cannabis joints with the complainant and others. He told the court: “It is very usual that I have a number of cannabis joints ready and rolled. I like to get high.” Spacey denies 12 charges: seven of sexual assault, three of indecent assault, one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent, and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The trial continues."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T00:24:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 493 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The top US military officer, Army General Mark Milley, said he was unsurprised that progress in Ukraine’s counteroffensive was slower than some people and computers might have predicted. “This is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview published on Friday. CIA director William Burns called Russian spy chief Sergei Naryshkin after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The call was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, the Wall Street Journal said. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday he was certain Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed in his country would never be used. Lukashenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin have acknowledged that some tactical weapons have arrived in Belarus and the remainder would be put in place by the end of the year. “As we move along, we become more and more convinced that they [the weapons] must be stationed here, in Belarus, in a reliable place,” Lukashenko said. A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) has claimed. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/mar/02/alex-murdaugh-trial-key-moments","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T00:21:26Z","webTitle":"Violence, corruption, power: key moments of Alex Murdaugh’s trial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/02/alex-murdaugh-trial-key-moments","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/mar/02/alex-murdaugh-trial-key-moments","fields":{"bodyText":"The trial of Alex Murdaugh for the killing of his wife and son captivated the US as a deep south gothic story of violence, corruption, money and power. It was an intricate story that played out over weeks of a televised courtroom drama that saw hundreds of journalists flock to a poor slice of rural South Carolina, turning the tiny town of Walterboro into a media circus. Here are some of the key moments: Murdaugh’s decision to testify against his defense team’s advice On the stand, Murdaugh admitted that he had been at the crime scene – a dog kennel on the family estate – on the night of the murders but maintained he had left before the killings took place to nap and to visit his mother. That countered his longstanding claims, made in taped interviews soon after the bodies of wife Maggie and son Paul were discovered, that he had not seen the pair for 90 minutes. He told that story on the night of the murders and again three days later. On the witness stand, he said that paranoid thinking brought on by an addiction to painkillers had caused him to lie to investigators. “I wasn’t thinking clearly,” he said. “I don’t think I was capable of reason, and I lied about being down there, and I’m so sorry that I did.” His own legal team had been against Murdaugh testifying but he insisted. Defense mistake that allowed prosecutors to bring in financial motive Another key point came when an apparent mistake by Murdaugh’s defense team allowed prosecutors to introduce evidence of the disbarred lawyer’s financial crimes that the state claimed motivated the murders by creating a distraction that would gain sympathy and time. The circuit court judge Clifton Newman said that the defense had “opened the door” to allowing Murdaugh’s financial situation brought into evidence after defense lawyers questioned witnesses on the stand about his character and if Murdaugh had any reason to kill his wife and son. Newman then said the jury was “entitled to consider whether the apparent desperation of Mr Murdaugh because of his dire financial situation and threat of being exposed … While motive is not a necessary element, the state must prove malice, and evidence of motive may be used to prove it.” Murdaugh later admitted to stealing from his law firm and clients. “I hate the fact that I did it. I’m embarrassed by it. I’m embarrassed for my son,” he said under cross-examination. “I’m embarrassed for my family, and I don’t dispute that I did it.” The Snapchat video Another shocking moment came earlier when prosecutors introduced cellphone video Paul Murdaugh sent to a friend minutes before he was killed. It showed a chocolate Labrador retriever and three voices could be heard in the background. During his testimony, Murdaugh admitted one of the voices was his. “Mr Murdaugh, is that you on the kennel video at 8.44pm on June 7,” defense attorney Jim Griffin asked, “the night Maggie and Paul were murdered?” “It is,” Murdaugh said. The defendant misspeaks? It did not help Murdaugh’s defense case that when he was shown crime scene photos he told police investigators: “It was so bad, I did him so bad.” But at his trial, Murdaugh’s lawyers said he’d actually said: “They did him so bad.” The taped was played to the court at 1/3 speed but the exact phrase was indiscernible. “I still hear him say ‘I’,” Jeff Croft, an agent with the South Carolina law enforcement division, testified. No one else in the frame Perhaps most crucially for some observers, there were no other suspects in the case. The defense’s two-shooter theory that rested on a gunman being less than 5ft 4in – according to their interpretation of the gunshot trajectories – was never fleshed out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T19:40:53Z","webTitle":"‘Strength and femininity’: Victoria Beckham power dresses in Paris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/mar/03/strength-and-femininity-victoria-beckham-power-dresses-in-paris","fields":{"bodyText":"For Victoria Beckham, rising to the challenge of a Paris catwalk show began at ground level with the 6in platform heels she wore on the Eurostar journey from London. “I suppose I feel a bit more pressure because it’s Paris, but I embrace that,” she said before her show. “And it’s a good way to wear-test the shoes to see if they are comfortable.” Beckham is one of three names who flew the flag for British talent on a single day at Paris fashion week. At just 26, Harris Reed, who describes his style as “romanticism gone non binary”, made his debut on Friday as the new creative director at Nina Ricci. It came as the athlete Dina Asher-Smith joined Schitt’s Creek stars Catherine O’Hara and Dan Levy for an all-star front row at Loewe, which is designed by Jonathan Anderson. The star of Beckham’s front row was her 11-year-old daughter Harper, who had designed her own trousersuit for the occasion. (“She had a very clear vision,” noted her mother.) On the day of the show, Beckham’s label announced it had turned a profit in 2022 for the first time, with revenues rising 42% to £58m. Paris fashion week has been headlined by a return to power dressing, a vibe shift which Beckham reflected in “the biggest shoulders I’ve ever done. A jacket with a broad shoulder, and legs poking out, that’s what feels desirable to me now. That combination of strength and femininity.” Beckham put shoulder pads in her dresses for the first time; jeans had knife-sharp front creases stiffened with resin. A hit of humour cut through the glamour and polish as what appeared from a distance to be silk fringing turned out to be acrylic hair extensions. Reed chose a venue as French as they come for his Nina Ricci show – the former Air France headquarters in the shadow of Napoleon’s tomb – but opening with curve model Precious Lee in polka-dotted sheer taffeta was a mission statement about bringing more diverse and inclusive casting to Paris. The designer recently told Vogue that “Paris shows have always struggled a little bit because there’s a lot of white cisgender girls who are a bit underweight … looking at the French shows [and] I was like: ‘I don’t see femininity expressed in a way that feels curvaceous.’ And that’s deeply important to the inclusivity, to the femininity, that I want to bring to the helm of this brand.” He is introducing a broader-size run at the brand. The show was a stride into new territory for a house closely associated with the soft-focus, chiffon-draped adverts for its L’Air du Temps perfume. The house motif, a pair of doves, turned up here as metallic nipple pasties. Anderson put his catwalk in a 14th-century chateau as a form of show-and-tell. He “confronted history” at Loewe this season – after a decade of ignoring the house’s archives, his latest handbags are based on 1970s bestsellers – and wanted his audience to do the same. So he had them cross a wooden drawbridge and pass beneath a turreted arch to reach the catwalk. This was a high-concept event, from the stage set – Lara Favaretto’s art installation of 10,000kg of coloured confetti – to the peel-on, peel-off knitwear which will be available to purchase as stickers. Avant-fashion can feel chilly and antiseptic, but Anderson makes it sing by tuning into how clothes express thoughts and feelings. The unconscious defensive gestures of holding an elbow with the opposite hand to create a barrier with one arm, or of pulling sleeves down to conceal your hands, were baked into the way the fabric fell. A silk duchesse dress seemed to be suspended precariously from one gold clasp at the collarbone, bringing a mood of high-drama fitting that channelled the energy of a special night out. Anderson, backstage after the show, called it “emotional engineering”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/20/the-terrible-power-of-the-state-to-ruin-lives-was-exposed-by-the-case-of-andrew-malkinson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-20T07:02:40Z","webTitle":"The terrible power of the state to ruin lives was exposed by the case of Andrew Malkinson | Sonia Sodha","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/the-terrible-power-of-the-state-to-ruin-lives-was-exposed-by-the-case-of-andrew-malkinson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/20/the-terrible-power-of-the-state-to-ruin-lives-was-exposed-by-the-case-of-andrew-malkinson","fields":{"bodyText":"We like to think that our criminal justice system locks up criminals and exonerates the innocent. A comforting working assumption; but the reality is more complex. High-profile miscarriages of justice – and the years some spend wrongfully in prison – are signs that the system sometimes gets it dreadfully wrong. One way of designing out wrongful convictions is through a demanding evidentiary threshold: to convict someone, juries need to be “sure” that a defendant is guilty. The flipside of this is that the probably-guilty have to be allowed to walk free. But jury deliberations are only one part of the process and are certainly not sufficient to prevent serious miscarriages of justice, as the horrific treatment of Andrew Malkinson has shown. Malkinson last month had his rape conviction overturned by the court of appeal after 17 years in prison. His case has been plagued by serious failings at every turn. Greater Manchester police failed to disclose key evidence undermining the prosecution’s case against him to his defence team at the time of his trial, including key witnesses’ criminal convictions and important photographic evidence. This only came to light 15 years later, as a result of extensive legal action by the charity Appeal. Three years after his 2004 conviction, the DNA of another man was found in a “crime specific” spot on the victim’s clothing by a nationwide forensic review. The police and the Crown Prosecution Service were notified, but a CPS lawyer said there was no need for further work unless the case was brought to appeal, and then his focus would be on “bolstering” the case against Malkinson. Malkinson applied twice to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) – the body charged with reviewing whether potentially unsafe convictions should be referred to the court of appeal – citing this new evidence, but the CCRC did not use its considerable investigatory powers to look at the original police file or request new DNA tests, and rejected his applications. It was only after the Appeal charity commissioned its own tests and uncovered the disclosure failures that Malkinson’s third application to the CCRC was successful, which resulted in the court of appeal overturning his conviction. No one can give Malkinson back those 17 years. It is a reminder of the awesome power the state has to ruin people’s lives through corruption or incompetence. And it cannot be written off as a terrible but exceptional mistake. That such clear DNA evidence emerged makes Malkinson’s case unusual, but the fact that it still took him more than a decade to clear his name – with considerable time and resources invested by a campaigning charity – points to something seriously amiss in our justice system and the way it can produce, then fail to rectify, wrongful convictions. The issue starts with the way crimes are investigated and prosecuted. The police’s role is to independently investigate crimes without prejudice; the CPS’s to make independent decisions about whether there is a strong enough case for the state to prosecute. They are not supposed to be “for” or “against” a defendant; they are statutorily obliged to disclose to the defence evidence that undermines their own investigation or case. Yet even the most well-meaning police officers and CPS lawyers are human beings: it would take almost superhuman faculties not to become invested in a case against someone you really think did it. They operate in a system with shrinking resources, despite the greater volume of digital evidence involved in modern police work, and in a context of political pressure to increase conviction rates. In our adversarial legal system, the main check on the independence of the police and the CPS is the defendant’s legal team. Yet deep cuts to legal aid mean that defence lawyers are operating on shoestring budgets, and there are serious questions about the quality of defence that people can access. If a defendant has been wrongfully convicted, the appeals process is stacked against them. It can be difficult to find someone to represent you on legal aid in the first place. Some experienced lawyers and academics think that the court of appeal is itself too reluctant to quash wrongful convictions. The CCRC was set up as an independent body to assess whether potentially unsafe convictions should be referred to the court of appeal, but it has been rendered unfit for purpose through funding cuts; worrying evidence hints at political interference. There is a lack of accountability over its decisions: the only potential challenge is through judicial review, an extremely expensive process. Malkinson is far from the only person turned down by the CCRC who went on to overturn their conviction. Victor Nealon’s application to appeal was rejected twice; his rape conviction was, like Malkinson’s, eventually overturned on the basis of DNA tests commissioned by his own legal team. All this has led one former senior judge to argue that it has become harder than ever to challenge wrongful convictions; a damning assessment in light of the high-profile miscarriages of justice such as the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six that led to the establishment of the CCRC in the first place. Ultimately, we have a justice system that embeds a naively optimistic view of human psychology – it relies on the independence of the police, CPS lawyers and judges while real-world pressures and biases tug against that – while significant reductions in resourcing have eroded some of the checks and balance on their decision-making. Add a political desire to improve conviction rates and you have a recipe for more miscarriages of justice. The penalties are severe, most obviously for the person wrongfully convicted. The government may have now changed the rules around financial compensation, so that someone no longer has it docked because of “savings” they made on housing as a result of being unjustly convicted, but people must actively prove their innocence in order to get any compensation at all; Nealon did not qualify. But there are also penalties for the victim, who has to learnthat her attacker has gone unpunished, and for society at large, because the real perpetrator remains free to reoffend. While it is poor, minoritised and overpoliced communities who disproportionately suffer the consequences, miscarriages of justice can affect anyone. Making sure that those who stand accused of terrible crimes get due process may not be a popular cause, but it is fundamental not just to the rule of law but to public faith in the justice system. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said that all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday, but two generators were damaged in the process, delaying the restart of two reactors. Kotin said repeated shutdowns caused by more Russian missile attacks could cause extensive damage, with a potentially severe impact on Ukraine’s power supply and possibly on nuclear safety. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on a residential area in the city of Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, according to the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko. The Ministry of Defence in the UK said Russia had resorted to removing the nuclear warheads from cruise missiles and launching them with just ballast in their nosecones, with the aim of diverting Ukraine’s air defences and doing some damage just from the sheer force of their impact on targets. “Whatever Russia’s intent, this improvisation highlights the level of depletion in Russia’s stock of long-range missiles,” the ministry said in one of its daily assessments of the invasion. Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia could carry out another mass missile attack on infrastructure in the middle of this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, was seized by Russian forces in March and it has been off the grid since September, amid frequent shelling of the area around it. Ukraine’s three other nuclear power plants – Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi – have not been directly targeted in recent Russian missile strikes, but their safety could be threatened by further attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. Missile attacks last Wednesday on high voltage cables, transformers and substations triggered the first ever simultaneous emergency shutdown, or “scram”, of all four plants. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is becoming increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement. Kotin said: “In all the 40 years of operation of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, nothing like that has ever happened.” He emphasised that the plants were designed with multiple levels of protection against the kind of disastrous meltdown and explosion at Chornobyl in 1986. When the power grid failed under Wednesday’s attack, the reactors immediately scrammed to isolate themselves and diesel-powered generators started working to power the water circulation through cooling pools where spent fuel is kept. However, repeated attacks leading to more emergency shutdowns would impose enormous strain on all the components of the plants, from the core to the steam turbines to the generators, as result of rapid contraction and then expansion again when a plant is restarted. Kotin likened the process to driving a car at 200 km/h and then coming to an emergency stop. “You have all kinds of consequences, like your valves will warp – and there are a huge amount of valves between the reactor and the turbine,” he said. Ultimately, he added, the damage could have an impact on nuclear safety. Oleh Korikov, Ukraine’s chief inspector for nuclear safety, said each time there was an emergency shutdown, the risks multiplied. “Any use of the scram system may cause an accident,” Korikov told the Observer. “With this shutting-down process, it increases the probability of some malfunction of equipment or some mistake by personnel.” The diesel generators can keep the cooling and other safety systems going, but they do not produce enough power to restart a power plant. After an entire electric power system has shut down, that process is called a “black start” and it gets progressively harder the longer the shutdown lasts. A complicating factor is that the shutdown of a nuclear reactor produces an isotope of xenon in the fuel rods that absorbs neutrons, slowing down fission and adding to the difficulty in booting it back up. The stopping and restarting all requires substantial skill on the part of the plants’ Ukrainian staff, and the pressure on them is considerable, particularly the workers at the Zaporizhzhia plant, who are operating under armed Russian surveillance. In early October, Moscow declared the plant was part of Russian territory and therefore was under the supervision of Rosatom, the Russian nuclear power company. Staff at the plant have been put under pressure to sign documents acknowledging they were working for a Rosatom subsidiary. “Some people signed it but not many,” Kotin told the Observer. “There was a huge push from the beginning but right now it has stopped. The occupiers just stopped all the rhetoric they used before, like ‘this is Russia for ever under Rosatom’.” Some observers see this change in attitude as a sign that the Russian occupiers of the plant may be intending to withdraw. Kotin added that a second signthey may making contingency plans to leave was systematic looting. “They are starting to steal everything they can see, and they have packed their bags to get out from there,” he said, while emphasising there was no clarity over the Russians’ intentions. A former Zaporizhzhia worker who has been in contact with current employees said they had seen no signs of Russian departure. On the contrary, they said, soldiers at the plant were making preparations for a long winter, moving their sleeping quarters to the canteen. Grossi has been trying for months to negotiate the creation of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear plant where shelling would be prohibited, but Ukraine is insisting that such a zone should be completely demilitarised. “It is illegal for heavy weaponry to be within a civilian nuclear object. They actually use it like a military base for the protection of their heavy weaponry, which they have put in the turbine halls of units [reactors] one and two,” Kotin said. “This is a completely awful situation for fire safety. If there is a fire emergency, then you can’t mitigate it, because you just cannot get access – because all the free space in the turbine halls is packed with all these vehicles.” He said it was unclear whether there were any explosive materials stored in the turbine halls. The militarisation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is adding to the constant pressure on the staff, who are faced with the task of keeping two of the reactors in “hot shutdown” mode – a delicate operation – to provide some power and heating to the plant and the next-door town of Enerhodar, where the workforce lives. “If you have armed people breathing down your neck in the control room, it’s just an incredibly dangerous situation,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “If you have the three other nuclear power plants without any off-site power, and you can’t restart them because the grid is down, it’s like three enormous ticking timebombs,” Budjeryn added. “All of this combined means we’re talking about the most dangerous moment for nuclear security so far.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-02T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Power of touch: how blind women are helping detect breast cancer in India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/jun/02/power-of-touch-how-blind-women-are-helping-detect-breast-cancer-india-acc","fields":{"bodyText":"The most satisfying part of Ritika Maurya’s work is reassuring the anxious. “Women fear coming for breast examinations,” says Maurya. “What if a lump is found in my breast? Will that be the end of my life? These are some of the questions that haunt them all the time.” Maurya is, she says, “still learning to be good at this”. As a blind child, she had a sheltered upbringing with protective parents who rarely let her leave the house. Now aged 23, she is a trainee medical tactile examiner (MTE) at Enable India, a disability rights organisation in the southern city of Bengaluru – part of a project where visually impaired women are taught to use touch to detect breast lumps or changes that might mean a lurking cancer. Maurya chats with her clients about their day, offers them water and holds their hands. She loves her work. Devised by a German gynaecologist, Dr Frank Hoffmann, through his social enterprise Discovering Hands, the method was brought to India in 2017 and has also expanded to Colombia, Mexico, Austria and Switzerland. However, the programme has been paused in Colombia and Mexico since the pandemic. Visually impaired women use braille-marked documentation tapes to measure the breast centimetre by centimetre. Each examination lasts 30-40 minutes and findings are passed on to a doctor who decides on any further assessment. MTEs can detect “lumps as tiny as 6-8mm, as opposed to the larger, 10-20mm ones sighted physicians are able to find”, Hoffman says. His system was introduced in India by the NAB India Centre for Blind Women and Disability Studies (NABCBW) in Delhi, where a study this year of tactile examinations on 1,338 women found 78% of malignant cancers were detected and only 1% missed. An earlier study in 2019 comparing the diagnostic accuracy of doctors and visually impaired MTEs found “clinical breast exams by MTEs with impaired vision appear to have an accuracy level similar to that of examinations by physicians or a combination of both”. Training was expanded to Bengaluru in 2020 by Enable India. Its founder, Shanti Raghavan, says they want breast-cancer screening to be available in “every village” of India. Since 2017, 18 MTEs have been trained in Bengaluru and Delhi; six are now employed in cancer hospitals. The next eight trainees, of whom Maurya is one, are about to graduate and the next cohort will be chosen soon after. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. In India, it is the leading cause of death from cancer among women, but 60% of cases are diagnosed at stage three or four of the disease, resulting in a significant reduction in survival rates. MTEs are a useful tool in the fight to change that picture says Dr Poovamma CU, a surgical oncologist at Cytecare, a hospital in Bengaluru that employs two of the women. “Women are uncomfortable about doing breast self-examinations and often don’t realise there’s a lump in their breast until it has grown to 4cm or 5cm,” she says. “Routine breast cancer screenings by MTEs in urban and rural communities and workplaces, where mammograms and ultrasound machines cannot reach, can make a significant impact in India, where robust government-run screening programmes don’t exist,” she says. Maurya, who has no vision in one eye and can only see shapes from the other, says her impairment heightens her tactile abilities – and science supports her. A blind examiner also means women feel more comfortable undressing, she says. Moving 1,300km (830 miles) away last July to Bengaluru, where she shares a room with another trainee, was a huge step for Maurya, whose world in Indore had been restricted to her home and family: her parents did not let her leave the house alone. “They would say: ‘What if you bump into something and hurt yourself?’” she says. “I felt awkward and uncomfortable talking to anyone, thinking that I had no talent and skills.” There are estimated to be 15 million women in India with visual impairment but only 5% of them have a chance to earn a living, according to NAB. For Maurya, the programme struck her as a rare opportunity. “I wanted to prove myself and show others that I could survive in this world,” says Maurya, who convinced her parents to let her try it. At Enable India, Maurya was given a white cane and mobility training so she could start moving independently from the NGO to her accommodation. She learned human physiology and anatomy, using 3D models, and was awe-struck, realising how much she had missed out on. “I felt, ‘oh, I could have studied science in school as well’, if only if I was taught through the ‘touch and feel’ methodology,” Maurya says. In the past year, the trainees have trekked to Thottikallu Falls, 30 miles from Bengaluru, and played golf for the first time. Maurya’s next step is a three-month internship at a Bengaluru hospital. “The training has helped me accept my disability,” she says. “Being an MTE gives me the feeling that I have a unique quality to do something that only I can do as a disabled woman.” This reporting was funded by the European Journalism Centre"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/mar/18/how-many-ex-pms-does-it-take-to-sink-australias-nuclear-submarine-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-17T14:00:44Z","webTitle":"How many ex-PMs does it take to sink Australia’s nuclear submarine deal? | Paul Karp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/18/how-many-ex-pms-does-it-take-to-sink-australias-nuclear-submarine-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/18/how-many-ex-pms-does-it-take-to-sink-australias-nuclear-submarine-deal","fields":{"bodyText":"How many former prime ministers does it take to sink eight nuclear submarines? Malcolm Turnbull was quick to share his concerns about the $368bn Aukus submarine purchase announced this week after 18 months of planning, but the opposition to Aukus was led by that Labor war horse: Paul Keating. And spectators of politics were treated to the best and worst of Keating at the National Press Club on Wednesday. Keating was at his weakest when defending China, deflecting questions about its human rights record by arguing mistreatment of Uyghurs is disputed. Challenged on how he could claim China is no threat to Australia, Keating responded “because I’ve got a brain”, labelling the question “dumb” and focusing only on the remote possibility of a land invasion. Trade sanctions are “not a threat” and cyber-attacks were also brushed aside because Russia and the US do them too. Yet amid all the free character assessments dished out, it was Keating’s reading of the internal dynamics of Labor that were the most perceptive. Keating assessed that in September 2021, when Scott Morrison sought Labor support for Aukus and nuclear submarines, Penny Wong was determined to prevent a “khaki election” and run the “smallest small-target strategy” by agreeing with the Liberals. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Anthony Albanese actually got out ahead of this criticism, noting in February in our political editor Katharine Murphy’s politics podcast that he would have pursued the Aukus alliance anyway because defence officials would have supplied the same advice. Keating took aim at Albanese for saying elsewhere that he was “very proud” to have provided bipartisan support for Aukus within 24 hours. The only way you could make such a decision – with its huge cost and implications for international relations – is “if you have no perceptive ability to understand the weight of the decisions you’re being asked to make”, Keating said. “It’s what other people call incompetence.” The defence minister, Richard Marles, countered in conversation with my colleague Daniel Hurst that the party didn’t decide “from scratch”, he was already “deeply immersed” since 2016 in the strategic thinking about submarine capability. Still, Keating said that Albanese had “no mandate” to agree to Aukus, predicting that when Labor branch members cotton on “there will be a big reaction”. If you were making a Frankenstein monster to scare Labor’s leftwing membership base, Aukus has some pretty alarming nuts and bolts: ever-closer alignment with the US, high level nuclear waste to be stored in Australia and hundreds of billions of defence spending. But the announcement front-loaded the winners from the plan (jobs for South and Western Australia). The losers are back-loaded: a nuclear waste dump, whereabouts TBD; $3bn of mystery cuts elsewhere in defence TBA; and a barney over where to put the east coast base, which locals at Port Kembla oppose. Few so far seem genuinely spooked by it. The Maritime Union and shipbuilding unions, including the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, wanted conventional submarines. Doug Cameron, a former AMWU secretary and Labor left senator, and Peter Garrett, the former environment minister, both bagged Aukus. One hard-left former union official and Labor staffer revealed on social media that his local branch had passed a resolution (before the announcement, incidentally) calling for a withdrawal from Aukus and abandonment of nuclear submarines – but whether that catches on is unclear. For the parliamentary Labor party, it seems the imperative of continuing Albanese’s honeymoon run trumps everything. That position may come under strain as parliament marks the 20th anniversary of the Iraq war invasion, a military decision which Labor rejected from opposition – a big call Keating says they got right and the sort of thing that might inspire more opposition to integration with the US system. Labor MPs this week were remarkably united, locked in behind a policy that has been set for so long and well-briefed on the specifics of its price tag and why it is necessary. They say their phones haven’t blown up. Josh Burns, the member for Macnamara in inner south Melbourne, said people respected what was a “serious policy” and an “important decision” for the country. Graham Perrett, the member for Moreton in Brisbane, said “people are aware the world is very different, even from 2013. “We know there is a changed set of circumstances – not just in Ukraine … we know that our local patch is different.” Even the question of how to pay for Aukus didn’t spark a fight . That was partly because the cost over four years is purportedly budget neutral and partly because the kite-flying exercise on reforming stage three tax cuts was already tried last year by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. For now, it’s no official change. That left the crossbench, particularly Senator David Pocock and the Jacqui Lambie Network, as the only ones joining the dots between the $368bn-over-30-year spending on Aukus and the $250bn over 10 on the stage-three tax cuts. A dishonourable mention this week goes to Peter Dutton for his suggestion that bipartisan support for cuts to the national disability insurance scheme could pay for Aukus. All the opposition leader needed to tell the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson was the Coalition would support appropriate savings but not Labor tax hikes. Instead he singled out one vulnerable category of welfare recipient, doubling down the next day after the announcement rather than taking the opportunity to clean up. Albanese got the line right on 3AW on Thursday: Aukus should be considered separately to measures to pay for it, because revenue and taxes are not reserved for a particular purpose. All in all, the sell has started well for Albanese: so far the critics are few and familiar, and the federal party remains united behind an enormous undertaking."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-17T04:09:59Z","webTitle":"Aukus nuclear submarine deal will be ‘too big to fail’, Richard Marles says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/17/aukus-nuclear-submarine-deal-will-be-too-big-to-fail-richard-marles-says","fields":{"bodyText":"Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine deal with the US and the UK will rapidly become “too big to fail”, the deputy prime minister has said. Richard Marles made the comment in an interview with Guardian Australia’s politics podcast, pushing back at the idea the multidecade Aukus plan could be vulnerable to political changes in both the US and the UK. He also predicted that broader diplomatic efforts to stabilise the relationship between Australia and China would “continue largely unaffected by what has been announced during the course of this week”. As the minister for defence, Marles has been at the centre of the Aukus planning. He said he had felt the “gravity” and “responsibility” of this week’s announcement of sweeping, staged plans that involve Australian spending of up to $368bn by the mid-2050s. One point of contention has been the Australian promise to provide $3bn in funding over the next four years to subsidise the submarine production base in the other two countries, mostly the US, and what guarantees there were that the US would actually proceed with selling three to five Virginia-class submarines to Australia in the 2030s. Asked what contracts or agreements sat underneath the high-level political commitment announced in San Diego this week, Marles said the project was “a shared endeavour of the three countries”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “There is going to be a legal underpinning to this … and there is going to need to be a treaty-level document between our three countries, so there is a whole lot of legality which will be worked through,” Marles said. “But in so many ways this transcends that [given] the sheer size of the decision to share this capability with Australia. And having taken the step of doing that, which we’ve done, puts all three countries in a position where it’s too big for it to fail on the part of any of those countries.” Marles said all three countries were “deeply committed to each other’s success in this project” and that was what gave him “a sense of assurance that this is going to play out in the way that we want it to play out”. “This must work for the US, this must work for the UK, as much as it must work for Australia,” he said. Despite Beijing’s strong criticism of the Aukus deal this week – which has included labelling it a cold war-era pact that would be dangerous for the region – Marles said Australia’s push for a productive relationship with China would continue. “China invests, obviously, in its own defence capabilities; we are doing that in respect of ours,” he said. “In terms of the relationship between our two countries and the way in which we speak to each other and the way in which we engage, I really do think that the project of seeking to stabilise that will continue.” Marles also addressed questions about whether the submarines could become obsolete, given that an Australian National University report, Transparent Oceans?, found that scientific and technological advancements predicted oceans were “likely” or “very likely” to become transparent by the 2050s. “Just as there is a lot of effort going into illuminating the seas, there is a lot of effort going into creating more stealth around a submarine,” Marles said. “You could flip the question and say: how confident are we that the veil of the sea will be lifted by 2050 such that we don’t need a submarine capability? Well, that would be a negligently risky call to make on the part of any Australian government.” Marles said the fact many countries were investing heavily in submarines showed that they would be “really useful parts of military capability for decades to come”. “But precisely because there is an effort to illuminate the sea is why a submarine capability, based on a diesel-electric power system, is going to be through the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s a comparatively diminishing capability, because more of that will be able to be seen.” The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons said this week that the best way for Australia to reassure the region about the submarine plan would be to sign and ratify the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. It is Labor party policy to do so, but only “after taking account” of several factors, including the need for an effective verification and enforcement architecture and work to achieve universal support from other nations. The nuclear weapons states including the US have opposed the treaty, arguing it is out of step with the current security environment. Marles said Australia wanted “a world where there are no nuclear weapons”, and had sent observers to the first meeting in Vienna last year. “A meaningful contribution to the removal of nuclear weapons needs to involve the engagement of the countries which have the nuclear weapons,” he said. “We completely get the intent of it, and we agree with the intent of it … but what the treaty needs to seek to achieve is universality in terms of those countries signing up to it, so that’s the issue.” • Hear the full interview with Richard Marles on Guardian Australia’s politics podcast"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T10:37:14Z","webTitle":"Clinton optimistic about power sharing in Northern Ireland after DUP talks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/18/bill-clinton-optimistic-power-sharing-northern-ireland-dup-talks","fields":{"bodyText":"Bill Clinton has expressed optimism that there will be a breakthrough in Northern Ireland’s political deadlock and a restoration of power sharing. The former US president made the prediction on Tuesday after meeting Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, which holds the key to resolving the crisis. “I left that meeting more optimistic than I entered it,” Clinton, 76, told the BBC. Rishi Sunak’s post-Brexit deal with the EU had brought a political solution “pretty close”, he said. “So I expect that, in the not too distant future, the barriers to bringing up the government again will be removed because everybody knows that economically, socially and politically, they would be worse off if they packed it in over the current level of disagreement.” The comments fuelled speculation Donaldson intends to end a DUP boycott that has paralysed the Stormont assembly and executive for more than a year. Clinton is in Belfast this week with his wife, Hillary, for a conference at Queen’s University to mark the Good Friday agreement’s 25th anniversary. He shared a platform on Monday with the former British and Irish prime ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, who exhorted the DUP to revive Stormont. Donaldson has shunned the conference, prompting criticism from some participants. One, who declined to be named, said it was “shocking” given that George Mitchell, a former US senator who chaired peace talks in the 1990s, had made the trip despite being treated for leukaemia. Mitchell is 89. Clinton, who helped pave the way for the Good Friday agreement, declined to elaborate on his talks with Donaldson. “I’m here as a friend of the peace process and a friend of hope,” he said. The DUP collapsed power-sharing to protest against post-Brexit trading arrangements with Great Britain, which it said damaged trade and Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. It welcomed aspects of Sunak’s Windsor framework, that amended the arrangements, but wants further changes. There is speculation Donaldson could move to restore devolution after local elections on 18 May. This would anger some hardline loyalists and unionists but be welcomed by most people in Northern Ireland as well as London, Dublin, Brussels and Washington. In a keynote speech to the conference on Tuesday, Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the DUP the Stormont impasse posed the “single biggest threat” to Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. He urged unionists to “put the union first, restore the devolved institutions and get on with the job of delivering for the people of Northern Ireland”. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s foreign minister, swelled the chorus in a speech that said the best way to honour those whose lives were lost or destroyed during the Troubles was to collectively rediscover the spirit that made the 1998 agreement possible. “The essential next step is for the politicians of Northern Ireland to assume their responsibilities, fill the roles and institutions created by the Good Friday agreement – all of them – and get to work to secure the futures of the young people of Northern Ireland, and the generations to follow,” Martin said. Clinton is due to return to Derry on Tuesday, the scene of a rapturous visit in 1995, to pay tribute to the late political leaders John Hume and David Trimble, who shared a Nobel peace prize for sealing the Good Friday agreement. All living former UK prime ministers have been invited to a gala dinner in Northern Ireland on Wednesday to mark the agreement’s anniversary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/12/australia-nearing-record-amount-of-solar-panel-uptake-to-beat-rising-power-prices-analysts-say","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-12T01:00:02Z","webTitle":"Australia nearing record amount of solar panel uptake to beat rising power prices, analysts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/12/australia-nearing-record-amount-of-solar-panel-uptake-to-beat-rising-power-prices-analysts-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/12/australia-nearing-record-amount-of-solar-panel-uptake-to-beat-rising-power-prices-analysts-say","fields":{"bodyText":"Rooftop solar is on track for another near-record annual installation tally as households seek to beat rising power prices with new or bigger photovoltaic systems. In the first six months of 2023, households and businesses added about 1.46 gigawatts of new solar capacity in small-scale systems, about a fifth higher than a year earlier, according to Green Energy Markets. For June alone, almost 250 megawatts of new capacity went on to rooftops, 13.2% more than for the same month in 2022. Higher electricity prices in the past year have stoked demand for solar panels, the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets, Tristan Edis, said. With a further increase of as much as 25% being imposed from this month, 2021’s record for new capacity of about 3.2GW set in 2021 may come close to being broken. “It’s tracking at the second highest it’s ever been,” Edis said. “I think it’s going to continue to be a robust year in terms of sales because of power prices … and by the end of the year, [new capacity] is probably going be similar to what it was in 2021.” Australia has the world’s highest per-capita solar energy penetration, with almost one in three homes hosting PV panels. Even in winter, more than a quarter of the electricity used in the eastern states is being generated on rooftops during the peak of sunny days such as Tuesday, according to the OpenNEM website. The ongoing strength of rooftop solar installations contrasts with the sharp slowdown in new investments for large-scale solar farms in recent years. Rystad Energy, a data group, estimates approvals for utility-scale renewable projects sank by 75% since 2018 in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with supply chain issues, transmission project delays and a lack of backup storage capacity to blame. NSW was the state most affected by delays in project approvals, “putting it at real risk of not approving enough capacity in time to meet its 2030 target of 12GW of operational utility solar PV and wind”, Rystad said. Existing solar farms were facing curtailment in some regions, such as western Victoria, where generation capacity exceeded the capacity of the grid to transport electricity to users. During the first quarter of 2023, average curtailment rose by a third from a year earlier in the national electricity market, the Australian Energy Market Operator said. “There’s been a whole heap of solar farms added [in Victoria],” Edis said. “Almost all the duration between 11am and 1pm has been curtailed. It’s been spilled.” Edis said governments were better off promoting the take-up of “plenty of rooftop solar” until grid connections improved and big batteries became cheaper. Instead, states have been winding back support for solar and batteries for the home. South Australia, for instance, has ended its batteries support plan and Victoria is phasing its out, Edis said. The rooftop solar industry was “just ticking along” at an annual pace of 3.2GW “but we’re probably capable of doing a lot more”, he said. “We don’t have to upgrade transmission there.” Of new systems being bought, many are replacements of small units by larger ones as some households took advantage of falling prices. “You’re actually getting to have a second go at the low-hanging fruit” of the most suitable rooftops, Edis said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T14:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","fields":{"bodyText":"We should be wary of simple declarations about the increasingly rapid transformation of the electricity grid. The government has been given a sharp reminder of this after leaning too heavily on pre-election modelling that suggested its policies to boost renewable energy could lead to a $275 cut in bills by 2025. You never know when a Vladimir Putin-shaped villain might disrupt international fossil fuel markets, wreck your assumptions and leave you accused of breaking an election pledge. Peter Dutton doesn’t have this excuse. The most generous thing that can be said about his foray into the debate over electricity last week is that he might want to get a broader range of advice. Giving his budget reply speech, the opposition leader said the Coalition wanted more renewable energy, but it just wasn’t possible yet, and it was a mistake for the government to allow ageing and expensive fossil fuel power to be phased out now. More specifically: “The technology doesn’t yet exist at the scale that is needed to store renewable energy for electricity to be reliable at night, or during peak periods. That is just the scientific reality.” To put it mildly, this is not the consensus opinion of experts in the field. David Osmond, a Canberra-based engineer with the global energy developer Windlab, is among those with a markedly different, evidence-based take. For more than a year, he has been posting weekly results from a live simulation tracking what would happen in Australia’s main electricity grid if it relied primarily on renewable energy. Using a live stream of electricity data from Opennem, he adjusted inputs to see what would happen if there was enough wind and solar energy to supply 60% and 45% of demand respectively. He added enough short-term storage, likely to be in the form of batteries, to supply average demand for five hours. The results are encouraging. They suggest close to 100% of demand – 98.9% over a 61-week period – could be delivered by solar and wind backed by existing hydro power and the five hours of storage. Nearly 90% of demand was met directly by renewable energy and 10% had to pass through storage. Achieving it would require a major expansion of transmission, as proposed by Labor under its Rewiring the Nation policy. The 1.1% shortfall mostly came when it was less sunny in late autumn and winter. Other technology would be needed to fill that hole. Osmond believes for now that would probably be fast-starting gas-fired power plants that are already connected to the grid, don’t run most of the time and can be called on quickly. There was nothing to suggest new ones were needed. It means a small amount of fossil fuel generation remaining in the grid, but less gas would be burned than now and, crucially, no coal power would be required. In the longer term, the backup could possibly come from cleaner sources – probably pumped hydro, maybe hydrogen or biofuels. None of these necessarily make economic sense the way solar and wind do – it is hard to justify a plant that would hardly ever be used – but could be needed in the context of the grid. An alternative would be to over-build solar and wind so there was always enough capacity online. By Osmond’s admission, this is a simplified model that assumes, for example, that electricity transmission links between regions can be delivered efficiently. No one should assume that the transition will be straightforward. The point is the technology already exists, and is comparatively cheap. From there it is a matter of design, engineering and, importantly, cost management. The last bit necessary to ensure the lights stay on is likely to make up a disproportionate amount of the overall cost. But the evidence says a renewable energy-dominated system is comfortably the cheapest form of generation if done right. Plenty of other studies have reached similar conclusions. The big one is the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan, a roadmap for the optimal future grid that was released in June. It backed an accelerated build of available technology to reach 83% of renewable generation by 2030, 96% by 2040 and 98% by 2050 as the best, most likely option. Presented with this evidence, Dutton and the Coalition continue to opt for none of the above. They appear to have joined a small band, including many in the usual right-wing media echo chambers, convinced that the evidence presented is wrong. Dutton was mostly dismissive of batteries in his budget reply, and implied small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – a commercially unproven technology that has been repeatedly delayed and more expensive than promised – could be the answer that ensures cheap energy. No evidence has been presented to suggest SMRs are needed to meet demand in Australia, given the country’s wealth of renewable options. Never mind that no independent evidence has been offered to suggest it could compete on price. If SMRs prove economically viable and safe elsewhere there is nothing to stop Australia considering their use, perhaps at remote off-grid industrial sites. It will be a good thing if they are viable, given not every country has ample alternatives to fossil fuels. But they are not designed to do the job needed here – to turn on occasionally and fill gaps in a system running on cheaper, renewable energy. Rather than an endlessly reheated debate about nuclear – the Coalition is holding another review, so expect plenty more of this – Australians would be better served if its politicians had a close look at a major report last week by the International Energy Agency. For the first time, the IEA forecast that fossil fuel use across the globe would peak in the next few years as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated a shift to clean fuels. It found existing policies would soon lead to coal use falling and demand for gas would plateau by the end of the decade. The declines will be much faster if, as expected, climate action continues to ramp up. Australia has one of the world’s largest fossil fuel export industries. It is supporting massive developments expected to last until late into the century as though nothing much is going to change. The significant climate impact of these developments is still routinely overlooked by the major parties on the grounds the gas and coal are burned overseas, and therefore somehow not Australia’s problem. But what about the economic and social impact of their potentially rapid decline? Now there’s an issue truly worthy of more parliamentary debate and action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power. In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices. The IEA report showed that clean energy investment has accelerated well beyond spending on gas, coal and oil as governments become increasingly concerned about developing secure, homegrown energy sources. However, the IEA report warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine has also prompted increased investment in upstream oil and gas, which is expected to rise by 7% in 2023 in a return to 2019 levels. At the same time global coal demand reached an all-time high in 2022, in part owing to record high gas prices, which has spurred estimated coal investment for this year to nearly six times the levels that are aligned with global 2030 climate targets. Birol said the single most important barrier facing the expansion of renewable energy remains problems with projects being able to connect to electricity grids. “We are seeing a pipeline of projects in Europe, US and Asia and Africa where the grid is the main problem. If you cannot reduce permitting time we will not be able to see the rapid expansion of renewables,” he said. In the UK, developers of renewable energy projects have complained that they have been forced to wait for more than a decade to connect to the electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/aug/25/york-bloom-flower-power-kew-anila-quayyum-agha-henri-fantin-latour-art-weekly","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-25T11:30:00Z","webTitle":"York gets flower power, Kew goes immersive and Wendy Red Star heads to London – the week in art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/25/york-bloom-flower-power-kew-anila-quayyum-agha-henri-fantin-latour-art-weekly","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/aug/25/york-bloom-flower-power-kew-anila-quayyum-agha-henri-fantin-latour-art-weekly","fields":{"bodyText":"Exhibition of the week Bloom Images of flowers, including still-life paintings by the wonderful Henri Fantin-Latour, Jan van Os and others, and an installation by Jade Blood. • York Art Gallery until 8 October Also showing Markéta Luskačová Retrospective for this Prague-born photographer of British society, including her sympathetic images of children. • Stills Gallery, Edinburgh, until 7 October Anila Quayyum Agha – All the Flowers Are for Me An immersive installation inspired by Islamic architecture and its refined use of light. • Kew Gardens, London, until 17 September Flora Yukhnovich and Daniel Crews-Chubb Big splashy colour-pumped paintings that respond to the Ashmolean’s collection. • Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, until 14 January Paul Bril to Wendy Red Star A chance to see prints and drawings recently collected by the museum from Bril’s European baroque art to a radical work by Apsáalooke (Crow) artist Wendy Red Star. • British Museum, London, until 10 September Image of the week After surrendering at the Fulton county jail in Georgia in relation to charges of election interference, Donald Trump had his booking photograph taken: an instantly famous image which joins a long list of celebrity mugshots, from Bugsy Siegel to David Bowie, telling the story of American culture and politics from the wrong side of the police photographer’s lens.

Where Pieter painted carnivals, war and plague, Jan specialised in flowers. His still lifes helped to put this gentle, metaphysical subject at the forefront of European art at the end of the Renaissance. His flower pieces were collected in Italy and imitated from Spain to Holland. This is a wondrous example of their richness and complexity. You lose count of the colours and forms of all these blooms. The artist’s own emotions are on show among the petals. He doesn’t look at these natural specimens clinically but with a soft poetic lyricism.

The chancellor also confirmed that the existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators, the energy profits levy (EPL), will be raised from 25% to 35% and extended by two years, until March 2028. From 1 January, a tax will also apply to “low carbon electricity generators”, including wind, solar and nuclear, levied at 45%. This is higher than the 40% rate trailed before the budget. Hunt said he expected the two taxes to raise £14bn next year. Treasury officials will meet energy bosses on Friday to discuss the proposals. Shares in the power station owners Centrica, Drax and SSE initially fell sharply moments after Hunt’s announcement, but later rallied as it emerged that the energy generator levy would be less onerous than feared. Oil and gas stocks were broadly unmoved. The chancellor said that most countries were still paying for the consequences of the pandemic and that this had been worsened “by a made-in-Russia energy crisis”. He had “no objection to windfall taxes if they are genuinely about windfall profits caused by unexpected increases in energy prices. But any such tax should be temporary, not deter investment and recognise the cyclical nature of energy businesses”. The surge in gas prices, in part fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has handed a surprise lift in profits to oil and gas companies, and generators including nuclear and biomass power stations and windfarms. The changes mean the EPL will raise a further £20bn over the next six years, to £40bn in total. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that oil and gas tax receipts, including the energy profits levy, will reach £14.9bn this financial year, double its March forecast. It said estimates for 2023-24 had quadrupled, to £20.7bn including £10.8bn. “The latter would be an all-time high for oil and gas revenues in cash terms, and the highest as a share of GDP since 1985-86,” it said, adding that volatility in energy prices meant these revenues are “particularly uncertain”. However, the energy profits levy has been criticised as it does not extend to the excess cash generated by oil and gas giants’ trading, refining and forecourts divisions. Hunt did not alter the levy to reach these windfalls. Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, said: “This so called windfall tax and budget doesn’t go anywhere near what’s needed to protect UK citizens that are being dragged into poverty, and barely touches the sides of the immense profits that energy companies have been amassing.” The OBR said onshore corporation tax, including the electricity generator levy, should raise £9.9bn next year. The levy is forecast to raise £14.4bn from 2022 to 2028. The generator levy was not as onerous as companies and investors had feared. The tax will be levied on “extraordinary profits”, made on electricity sold above £75 per megawatt hour. Power currently trades around £260 per MWh. Energy consultancy Aurora said future UK power prices are trading around £350/MWh and are forecast to remain above £225/MWh, making the levy more generous than the EU’s €180/MWh revenue cap. The government resisted calls to levy the tax on gas-fired power plants, which have also seen a rise in profits, arguing they were seeing higher costs and were exposed to “unique market risks”. Hydroelectric and battery storage facilities, oil and coal power stations were also omitted. The move to restrict profits on electricity generators represents a departure from the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to cap the revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, which would have been in line with the EU’s “revenue cap”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T11:17:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine faces ‘winter humanitarian crisis’ with energy grid on the brink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine faces a winter humanitarian crisis unless it can prevent a collapse in its electricity supply caused by the relentless campaign of Russian bombing, the chief executive of the country’s national grid has said. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive of Ukrenergo, said “virtually all” large non-nuclear power stations in the country had been hit, as well as more than 30% of the network’s routing substations. Describing the position as critical, the energy boss said Ukraine had asked western countries for badly needed spare parts last week – and repeated calls for more missile defence systems to help prevent damaging attacks. “This is the biggest missile attack on electricity infrastructure in history. Therefore, the impact is huge. Unfortunately the situation is critical. They are trying to specifically destroy the Ukrainian power system, and this supplies tens of millions of the population,” he said. If the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”, Kudrytskyi warned, adding that despite Ukrenergo’s efforts, it was not possible to repair the grid as fast as it was being destroyed. “It’s much easier obviously to launch missiles than to restore substations,” he said. The focus now is on keeping the lights on. “Before these missile attacks, the main goal was to supply as much energy as our customers need. However, now we’re speaking about the survival of the system,” Kudrytskyi told the Guardian during an air raid warning in Kyiv. Electricity was also necessary to sustain gas supplies, the chief executive said. “If the customers will spend too much time without electricity, and if heating systems have no connection to electricity, that will create big, social humanitarian problems.” He said Russia wanted to create “a humanitarian catastrophe” in Ukraine. Power cuts lasting several hours have become increasingly frequent in most areas of the country after a sustained Russian bombing campaign aimed at the electricity network that began last month. For now Ukrainians appear to be coping with the additional uncertainty and hardship without much complaint, accepting it as an unavoidable challenge they must overcome. Under the heading “No Power?”, a co-working space in Kyiv, Kooperativ Kyiv, has advertised that it has two electricity supplies and two internet suppliers so that people can work uninterrupted by the outages. “We’ll get through these times together,” read the advert. Ihor Sudakov, who lives next to a power station in east Kyiv that has been repeatedly hit, said he had attempted to prepare for further outages. “We’ve bought power banks – we keep at least three charged at a time,” he said. “We’ve also ordered this type of charging station that can charge a fridge and stove. Our building only has electricity so if the electricity goes we need to be able to cook.” As a double backup, he said, he had bought a propane camping stove. “I’m not worried that Russia will try to hit the [Kyjv] power station again – I know they will. It’s part of their terrorist tactics … so it’s about trying to be as autonomous as possible.” An attack involving 55 cruise missiles and five drones took place on Monday, aimed at the country’s hydro plants for the first time. Russian missiles targeted the electric infrastructure of the hydro plants, Kudrytskyi said, but not the dams themselves, which are considered more resilient. Although 44 of the missiles were said to have been intercepted by Ukraine, the damage caused on Monday was significant, the chief executive said. “It was in line with the scale of the attack, which was very big. This was a massive attack; massive damage [was] inflicted.” On Monday, 350,000 homes lost power in Kyiv and 80% of the water supply was disrupted after the attack, although both had been restored on Tuesday. Another 20,000 remained without supply in the Kyiv region, said the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba. In Kharkiv, where the main power station was damaged on Monday, Kharkiv hospital number 4 has been running on a reduced voltage – 180W instead of 220W – and there were concerns that this may damage the hospital equipment, said Oleksandr Dukhovsky, the head of paediatric surgery at the hospital. He said the hospital had fewer than five days’ worth of diesel to supply its backup generators. “We are not scared but we understand we need to be careful,” said Dukhovsky, adding that hospital staff were not losing faith and were willing to do what was necessary to win against Russia. Ukrainian officials do not release pictures of the damage to power plants and substations because they do not want Russia to precisely see what impact the attacks are having, but some facilities are acknowledged to have been destroyed. In Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is now less than 50% controlled by Russian forces and their proxies after recent Ukrainian advances, utilities have been intermittent or absent for months. Dmytro Myshenin of the NGO Vostok SOS, based in Kramatorsk, said that supplies had improved in a few towns but were still absent in places deemed too close to fighting, or very damaged. Towns such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk had had their water and gas supplies reconnected after the frontline was pushed back and people had returned, he said. But in areas closer to the frontline, people have now spent months living in dire conditions without running water and gas and some also without electricity. “There are many people surviving with portable wood-fired stoves and there aren’t enough of them,” said Myshenin. “We need more of everything.” A week ago, Ukraine sent out lists of replacement parts it needed to the US, UK, EU, and other western countries because “we need a lot of this equipment now”, Kudrytskyi said. He added that there was an urgent need for “western defence systems, which have proven to be very efficient against Russian missiles”. But the chief executive rejected claims that Ukraine could have better prepared. “We’re asking for defence systems all the time. I mean, this is not something new,” he said. “It’s not about our military needs. It’s about humanitarian catastrophe that has to be prevented for tens of millions of people in Europe.” Kudrytskyi said it would be possible for Ukraine – which used to be energy self-sufficient before the Russian attacks – to purchase electricity from Europe. But this would only be a partial help because of the damage to the country’s grid, which would make it harder to route electricity across the country, he said. “We can buy some energy from the EU because the Ukrainian power system is connected to the European power grid,” Kudrytskyi said. “However, we might be unable to deliver this important energy to certain regions, if the grid is damaged.” He also warned there was a danger of transmission bottlenecks. Large cities were at particular risk, he said, because of their huge energy demand. Among these, he listed the country’s main urban centres of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T17:51:52Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Belarus says transfer of nuclear weapons from Russia has begun –  as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-russian-rebels-belgorod-attack-raid-anti-putin-militia-latest-news","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Russia moved ahead on Thursday with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, claimed that the relocation of some of the weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, according to reports. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has begun withdrawing its forces from the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and transferring its positions there to regular Russian troops, according to its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were reportedly said to have been captured fighting in Bakhmut. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it described as the “complete lack of results” in an investigation to identify who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. Ukraine said on Thursday it had shot down all 36 Iranian-made drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks which it claims likely targeted key infrastructure and military facilities. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Dutch prosecutors have seized a plot of land near Amsterdam that belongs to Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law, a joint investigation by the Guardian and two other media organisations can reveal. The plot of land in Duivendrecht is owned by Jorrit Faassen, a Dutch businessman who was married to Maria Vorontsova, the Russian president’s elder daughter. An entry in the Dutch land registry shows that the plot of land was seized on 12 May by the national public prosecutor’s office for financial, economic and environmental offences. The agency is responsible for enforcing sanctions compliance. Dutch cadastre documents show that the land plot was seized as part of a criminal investigation. You can read more of this exclusive, by my colleagues Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer, here: America has long asked Ukraine not to use US-provided military equipment to carry out attacks inside Russian territory, Gen Mark Milley, the top US general, said on Thursday. Milley, who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said his office was looking into imagery appearing to show vehicles allegedly used in an attack around the Russian border region of Belgorod. But he said the US position against such US equipment being used inside Russia was clear to Kyiv, Reuters reports. During talks held this week in Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence minister personally thanked Ben Wallace for the UK’s continued military support for Ukraine, the Ministry of Defence has said. The UK defence secretary met his counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, during a visit to the Ukrainian capital, after the UK provided Ukraine with long-range precision strike capability earlier this month. British sources have said giving Storm Shadow missiles was compatible with the UK’s signature to the voluntary missile technology control regime, which is intended to limit the proliferation of cruise missiles. Wallace said in comments released on Thursday: I was pleased to visit Kyiv again to meet with my good friend Oleksii Reznikov to discuss the next stages of Ukraine’s fight against Russia’s illegal invasion. The UK continues to offer equipment, training and advice to Ukraine’s armed forces. I also visited some of the military commanders who have been so bravely pushing back Russian forces. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that it had scrambled fighter jets to escort two US strategic bomber planes away from the Russian border as they flew over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports. “The crew of the Russian fighter aircraft identified the aerial targets as two US air force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said in a statement. The US aircraft did not cross the border and the fighter jets returned to their home airfield, it added. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Ukraine said on Thursday that it would open more embassies in Africa, as it announced its intention to stage a historic summit with leaders from the continent. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, made the comments in a statement to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union). He said: We have recently adopted our first African strategy and intensified our political dialogue with many countries on the continent. This year, we are going to establish new embassies in different parts of the continent and plan to hold the first Ukraine-Africa Summit. I invite the leaders of your countries to take part in this important event. In a lower section, the address read: “We are hearing calls for peace from various countries and leaders. We support them as such and think they need to be directed first and foremost to Russia as the country that started this war.” Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president, confirmed on Thursday that the relocation of some tactical nuclear weapons from Russia to Belarus had already started, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russia signed a deal with its close ally Belarus earlier on Thursday about the storage of the warheads at a special facility that should be finished in just over a month’s time. It is unclear at this stage how many nuclear weapons would be kept in Belarus. Tactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield, and have a relatively short range. Speaking in Moscow, Lukashenko said “the movement of the nuclear weapons has begun,” AP reports, but he was not clear whether any actually had arrived in his country. Lukashenko, who sparked rumours of being seriously ill when he cut short a Victory Day appearance in Red Square on 9 May before resurfacing in public on 15 May, was attending a meeting of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council with Vladimir Putin and the leaders of Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plan for the nuclear deployment, Moscow’s first outside Russia’s borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, was announced by Putin in an interview with state television on 25 March. The Russian president has said the west is fighting an escalating proxy war against Russia. The US government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds, AP reports. The Danish foreign ministry has confirmed that its ambassador had been summoned by Russia over the Nord Stream investigation (See 12:34), and said authorities in Denmark, Germany and Sweden were continuing their investigations, Reuters reports. “Denmark has been providing ongoing updates to Russia regarding the investigation’s progress and responding to their inquiries. We will continue to do so,” the ministry said in an email. Unverified footage appears to show a drone speedboat attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs in the Black Sea on Wednesday. The video appears to show at least one of the drones getting extremely close to the ship, though it remains unclear whether or not any damage was done. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines last year. The head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner has claimed his forces have started pulling out of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine and handing over control to the Russian military. Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts, Hanna Maliar, the deputy minister of defence, said. Russia and Belarus signed a deal formalising the procedure for deploying Russian nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, AP reported. Control of the weapons will remain with Moscow. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after reports claimed that emergency services had been called to the building. Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said on Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. The European Commission has repeated calls for China to play a constructive role in establishing peace in Ukraine, Reuters reports. “The EU expects China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to play a constructive role (...) and to recall the necessity to respect the principles of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity (...) by unconditionally withdrawing all forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders,” the EU said in a statement on Thursday. Last week, Li Hui, China’s special representative for Eurasian Affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine and met Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a European tour that Beijing billed as its effort to promote peace talks and a political settlement. He is set to visit Russia on Friday. Finland will provide Ukraine with additional military aid worth around €109m, with the package containing ammunition and anti-aircraft weapons, Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential office, has been quoted by the Kyiv Post as saying. Finland is also among the European countries helping Ukraine defend itself on the battlefield, sending Leopard tanks to assist in combat. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinisto, for the military package, which he says is “urgently needed on the battlefield”. Zelenskiy tweeted: I thank Finland and President @niinisto personally for the prompt implementation of our agreements reached in Helsinki. The 16th package of defense assistance to Ukraine, which will include anti-aircraft systems and ammunition, is urgently needed on the battlefield. Together to victory! Anton Gerashchenko, a former minister and adviser to Ukraine’s interior minitry, has shared an unverified clip that purports to show a drone attack on the Russian naval vessel the Ivan Khurs yesterday. Russia claimed on Wednesday it had repelled three unmanned vessels that attempted to strike the reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea, but the video appears to show that at least one of the drones got extremely close to the ship, even though it remains unclear if any damage was caused. On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence issued this statement: Today at 05:30am, the Ukrainian armed forces made an unsuccessful attempt to attack the Ivan Khurs ship of the Black Sea fleet with three unmanned speedboats. [The Ivan Khurs] is performing tasks to ensure the safety of the operation of the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Turkey. All enemy boats were destroyed by fire from the standard armament of a Russian ship 140km north-east of the Bosphorus. The ship Ivan Khurs of the Black Sea fleet continues to fulfil its tasks. The chair of Ukraine’s parliament has offered words of reconciliation over second world war-era mass murders that have strained relations with its neighbour and strategic ally Poland for 80 years. Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers that the two countries should work together to identify and honour Polish victims buried in Ukraine, sounding a new tone in contrast to the recent angry reaction of Ukraine’s ambassador to Polish expectations of an apology. About 100,000 Poles were massacred in 1943-44 by Ukrainian nationalists and others in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine. “Human life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,” Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers. “With this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.” Poland this year is marking the 80th anniversary of the 1943-44 massacre. Entire villages were burned down and all their inhabitants killed by the nationalists. Poland calls the events a genocide. An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians died in retaliation. Associated Press reports Stefanchuk thanked the families of the victims for cultivating a memory that “does not call for revenge or hatred, but which serves as a warning that nothing like that can ever happen between our nations again”. He said identification and honoring of the victims “without bans or barriers” is “our joint moral and Christian obligation.” Poland’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Łukasz Jasina, had last week said that on the 80th anniversary Poland was expecting an apology from Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s ambassador to Poland, Vasyl Zvarych, reacted by saying that any suggestions of what Kyiv or Zelenskiy should do were “unacceptable and unfortunate”. Here are some of the latest pictures from Bakhmut. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian private military contractor Wagner, claimed on Thursday that his forces had started pulling out of the city. Ukraine, which denies that Bakhmut has fallen to Russia, insisted it still controlled a “micro district” of the devastated city and said it was still advancing on the flanks, AFP reports. There has been an update on the reports of the alleged detention of two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia (See 06:56am): The Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said the saboteurs working for Ukrainian foreign intelligence had laid explosives on 11 pylons of the Leningrad and Kalinin nuclear power stations. “The plan of the Ukrainian special services was to prompt the shutdown of the nuclear reactors, disrupt the operation of the nuclear power plants and cause serious economic and reputation damage to the Russian Federation,” the FSB said in a statement. The attacks were due to take place on the eve of the 9 May anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, added the FSB, which said the saboteurs had been recruited in 2022 by Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service. These claims could not be independently verified. The Leningrad station, located on the Gulf of Finland close to St Petersburg, is Russia’s biggest atomic power plant. The Kalinin nuclear power station is 350km north of Moscow. Ukraine has secured the release of 106 captured soldiers in a prisoner exchange with Russia on Thursday, according to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. The soldiers, including eight officers, were captured fighting in the devastated eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut that Russia says it has captured, but where Kyiv’s forces claim they still have a small foothold, Reuters reports. “Every one of them is a hero of our state. Many of the ones we are returning from captivity were considered missing. The relatives of these people have gone through a difficult time,” said Andriy Yermak, the senior official. There was no immediate information available about the forces Russia received from Ukraine in exchange. Here is some more reporting on the exchange from The Kyiv Independent: Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the ambassadors of Germany, Sweden and Denmark to protest over what it said was the “complete lack of results” of an investigation into blasts that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year. In a statement, the ministry accused all three countries of trying to conceal who was behind the blasts, adding that it was unhappy about what it called the opaque nature of the investigation and its refusal to engage with Russia. According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives. The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries have said the explosions were deliberate, but have yet to determine who was responsible. The two countries and Germany have been investigating the incident. Japan scrambled jet fighters after spotting Russian military planes over the Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan on Thursday, the defence ministry said. It detected one Russian information-gathering aircraft IL-20 flying round-trip from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Pacific and another IL-20 flying toward the waters near Sado Island before turning toward the continent, Reuters quotes the ministry as saying. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The EU agreed on Thursday to suspend restrictions on imports from Ukraine for a further year after warding off an import ban on grain imposed by some EU nations, Reuters reports. The Council of the EU, the grouping of EU governments, said in a tweet that EU ministers responsible for trade had agreed to the extension at a meeting on Thursday. The EU lifted tariffs and other restrictions for an initial 12 months in June 2022. In reaction to the news, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged for the “temporary liberalisation” to become permanent, as he continues to seek EU accession for Ukraine. He tweeted: As we move towards the EU, this temporary liberalization should become permanent – without any exceptions or restrictions. I am grateful to all EU members for their support, which brings us closer to the EU accession. Last month, EU governments agreed to extend the suspension of duties and quotas on imports from Ukraine by a year to help its economy during the war with Russia. Ukraine gained EU candidacy status in 2022 at record speed, but while it was an initial step to membership, the process usually takes many years to complete. In addition to Russia announcing on Thursday that five Swedish diplomats are to be expelled from the country (See 09:46), Moscow has additionally announced its decision to close its consulate in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September, Reuters reports. We reported earlier (See 10:27) that Russia is said to have replaced Wagner private military units with regular troops in the outskirts of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian mining city that has been largely devastated by a year of deadly fighting. Reuters has new quotes from Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, who had an update after reports of Wagner forces withdrawing from the eastern Ukrainian city and handing over their positions to regular Russian troops. Maliar wrote in comments on the Telegram app: “In Bakhmut’s outskirts, the enemy has replaced Wagner units with regular army forces. Inside the city itself Wagner fighters remain.” She also said that Ukrainian forces still have a foothold in the south-western outskirts of the city. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, claimed that the number of Russian attacks in the area had fallen in the last three days, and that there had been two military engagements in the last 24 hours, though shelling continued. You can read more on the fighting raging in Bakhmut here: Unverified footage of drones being shot down over Kyiv last night has been posted by Anton Gerashchenko, an advisor to the minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. He tweeted: Another sleepless night for many of us. Another attack on Kyiv. We hold on, go to work in the morning, thankful to our air defense and all our friends who keep Ukraine in their hearts and bring our Victory closer. Russia unleashed a barrage of drones against Kyiv in its 12th nighttime air assault on the Ukrainian capital this month, but the city’s air defences shot all of them down, Ukrainian authorities claimed on Thursday. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. Yesterday he warned of a new revolution in Russia if leaders did not improve their handling of the war. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counter-offensive coming from Ukraine that would be marked by a single significant shift of gear. He wrote: “Once again about the counter-offensive. This is not a ‘single event’ that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow.” Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down 36 out of 36 Shahad drones launched into Ukraine by Russia overnight. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that some areas of Chernivtsi were left without power after lines were damaged by falling drone debris. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine” as the two countries signed an agreement on the positioning of nuclear weapons in Belarus. During a visit to Minsk Sergei Shoigu said “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. Kremlin spokesperson Dimitry Peskov said Russia had always held Kyiv responsible, and that it didn’t really matter exactly which Ukrainian units were behind it. Podolyak on Thursday responded by saying Ukraine had nothing to do with the “strange and pointless” attack. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brink tweeted: “After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative.” Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. State-owned Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, but later reported the ministry saying there was none. Earlier today Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak sought to downplay the idea that there was a counteroffensive coming from Ukraine that would mark a significant shift of gear. He tweeted: Once again about the counteroffensive. Without further questions. 1. This is not a “single event” that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon. 2. These are dozens of different actions to destroy the #Russian occupation forces in different directions, which have already been taking place yesterday, are taking place today and will continue tomorrow. 3. Intensive destruction of enemy logistics is also a counteroffensive. However, as my colleague Dan Sabbagh, our defence and security editor, notes: “Except, at some point, Ukrainian ground forces will need to attack with sufficient combat mass …” Russia has replaced its Wagner private military units with regular soldiers in the outskirts of Bakhmut but the group’s fighters remain inside the devastated city, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday. Her comments appeared at least partially to confirm an announcement by Wagner founder Yevgeny Prigozhin that his group had started withdrawing its forces from Bakhmut in east Ukraine and handing over its positions to regular Russian troops. Yesterday, Julian Borger reported for the Guardian from Kyiv that Progozhin had said that 20,000 of its fighters have been killed in the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. He also warned that Russia could face another revolution if its leadership does not improve its handling of the war. Prigozhin pointed to the social disparity underlined by the war, with the sons of the poor being sent back from the front in zinc coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said in an interview posted on his channel on the Telegram messaging app. “First the soldiers will stand up, and after that – their loved ones will rise up. There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.” Reuters reports Russian prosecutors have asked a court to recognise crimes committed by Nazi Germany in the Moscow region during the second world war as a genocide against the peoples of the Soviet Union. Russia said on Thursday it would expel five Swedish diplomats in what it said was a retaliatory measure for Sweden’s “confrontational course” in relations with Russia. The Russian foreign ministry said it was responding to the expulsion of five of its diplomatic staff from Sweden last month, which it called an “openly hostile step”. Relations between the two countries have worsened since Sweden last year announced its intention to join Nato after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Reuters reports the Russian statement said ties had “reached an unprecedented low”. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide said on Thursday that Ukraine had nothing to do with a “strange and pointless” drone attack on the Kremlin and played down the findings of two US media reports. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, told Reuters in a statement that Russia was trying to reduce arms supplies to Kyiv by playing on western fears of a possible escalation because of alleged Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed that a drone attack on the Kremlin this month was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine. The US ambassador to Ukraine has criticised Russia over its implementation of the newly extended Black Sea grain initiative. Bridget Brinktweeted: After repeated threats to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia now refuses to allow any of the waiting 28 ships into Pivdennyi, one of the three ports designated by the agreement for food exports – a clear violation of their commitment. Russia must stop obstructing the operations of this life-saving initiative. Russia’s defence minister has said Belarus remains a “faithful ally and reliable partner” to Russia in the face of western states doing “everything possible … to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine”. Russia launched part of its full-scale invasion and failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian soil in February 2022, in what it termed a “special military operation”. In statements published on Telegram by Russia’s ministry of defence, Sergei Shoigu is quoted as saying his meetings with his Belarusian counterpart have become more regular, saying: This is especially important in the context of the rapid growth of tension, the destruction of the foundations of strategic stability and the unprecedented intensification of international confrontation. Everything possible is being done to prolong and escalate the armed conflict in Ukraine, which is receiving all kinds of military support. The Republic of Belarus has been and remains our faithful ally and reliable partner. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson has said of reports in the New York Times that Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin that “it doesn’t make much difference which of the units of the Kyiv regime is behind it”. Reuters reports Dmitry Peskov told the media: “We immediately said that the Kyiv regime was behind this.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, denied at the time that Ukraine was responsible. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Tass has more detail on the document signed today concerning arrangements for Belarus hosting Russian nuclear weapons. On Telegram it quotes Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu saying “deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus does not transfer it to the republic control over it, and the decision on its use remains with Moscow”. It also reports Shoigu noted the measures implemented by Russia and Belarus “comply with all existing international legal obligations”. Tass writes: Russian president Vladimir Putin said on 25 March that Russia, at the request of the Belarusian side, would deploy its tactical nuclear weapons in the republic, as the US has long done on the territory of its allies. According to the head of the Russian state, on 1 July it is planned to complete the construction of a storage facility for tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Moscow has already handed over to Minsk the Iskander missile system, which can be a carrier of nuclear weapons, and has assisted in re-equipping Belarusian aircraft to be able to use special ammunition. Belarusian servicemen have undergone appropriate training in the Russian Federation. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has started withdrawing its forces from the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a video published on Thursday, Reuters reports. Prigozhin had repeatedly threatened to withdraw troops from the area before it was taken, citing his dispute with the Russian military and defence establishment over supplies of ammunitions. A couple of days ago Prigozhin sarcastically suggested that his mercenary troops could be replaced by “a battalion of generals”. The defence ministers of Russia and Belarus on Thursday signed a document on the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. Separately, citing Russian media, Reuters reported that the Russia defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the west was waging an “undeclared war” against Russia and Belarus. Shoigu is in Minsk for a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the CSTO member states, which include Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Russia and Belarus, which are close allies over the conflict in Ukraine, agreed earlier this year to deploy part of Moscow’s tactical nuclear arsenal in Belarus. Russia launched its failed attempt to capture Kyiv from Belarusian territory last year. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this update on the overnight situation, writing on its official Telegram channel: At night, air defence forces destroyed 36 of the 36 ‘Shahed’ drones that Russia launched over Ukraine, the air force reported. Also at night, the Russian military struck Tsyrkuny in the Kharkiv region. The S-300 missile hit the ground. A private house was damaged, there were no injuries. In the Chernivtsi region, two power lines were damaged as a result of the fall of the drone debris – part of the Dnipro district was cut off. Three residential buildings were damaged. Yesterday, the Russian army shelled the Kherson region 83 times: four people were injured. The claims have not been independently verified. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, one of the occupied regions of the Donbas which the Russian Federation claims to have annexed, has posted to Telegram to state that in the last 24 hours one person has been killed and six injured by Russian shelling in the region. He listed a number of locations where houses and infrastructure had been destroyed, including Horlivka, Chasiv Yar and Kostiantynivka. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian-imposed head of Crimea’s administration said on Thursday that air defences had downed six drones overnight in different areas of the region. There were no casualties, Reuters reports Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014. Overnight the New York Times has reported that US intelligence officials believe that Ukraine was responsible for the drone attack which slightly damaged the Kremlin, and which Russia labelled an assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin, despite the Russian president not being in the building at the time. It writes: US officials said the drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month was likely orchestrated by one of Ukraine’s special military or intelligence units, the latest in a series of covert actions against Russian targets that have unnerved the Biden administration. US intelligence agencies do not know which unit carried out the attack and it was unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine or his top officials were aware of the operation. The New York Times goes on to say: US officials say their level of confidence that the Ukrainian government directly authorised the Kremlin drone attack is “low” but that is because intelligence agencies do not yet have specific evidence identifying which government officials, Ukrainian units or operatives were involved. The attack appeared to be part of a series of operations that have made officials in the US – Ukraine’s biggest supplier of military equipment – uncomfortable. The Biden administration is concerned about the risk that Russia will blame US officials and retaliate by expanding the war beyond Ukraine. American spy agencies see an emerging picture of a loose confederation of Ukrainian units able to conduct limited operations inside and outside Russia, either by using their own personnel or partners working under their direction. Some of these missions could have been conducted with little, if any, oversight from Zelenskiy, officials said. At the time, Zelenskiy said “We didn’t attack Putin or Moscow”, as he addressed journalists during a visit to Helsinki. Russia’s FSB security service says it has detained two Ukrainian saboteurs who were plotting to blow up power pylons of nuclear power stations in Russia, Reuters reports, citing Russian state-owned news agency RIA. More on that story now: Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment,said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. Investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: A second fire, which appeared to be unrelated, broke out at a market in Akos, in the Moscow region on Wednesday evening. Russia’s emergency services said on Telegram that the fire had increased from 500 sq metres to 1,800 sq metres and had been localised. No victims were reported. Russia has denied a fire broke out at the ministry of defence in Moscow, after users on social media and reports in the local Tass news agency said emergency services had been called to the building. Tass initially reported on a fire at the ministry early on Thursday morning, saying: “The fire broke out in the building of the Ministry of Defense of Russia in the centre of Moscow.” They cited an unnamed government source and said “a fire broke out on one of the balconies.” Emergency services were on the scene, the source told Tass. Almost an hour later, the news agency published a second story saying: “The Ministry of Emergency Situations did not detect a fire in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Moscow, the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation for Moscow told reporters on Thursday.” Both stories were still up on the website at 5am Thursday, Moscow time. Unverified video circulated on social media early on Thursday showing smoke emerging from the ministry building. In one video of the building seen by CNN, a woman could be heard saying: “The smell of burning is horrible.” Denis Kapustin, Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was asked repeatedly about Western media reports that his militia had used US military equipment that was meant to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, but declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately not from the Western partners”, he said. Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, spoke to reporters on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled the raid on the Belgorod region. Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as homegrown, internal Russian strife. Two groups operating in Ukraine – the Russian Volunteer Corps and Freedom of Russia Legion - have claimed responsibility. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who introduced himself by his call-sign White Rex. “I cannot reveal those upcoming things, I cannot even reveal the direction. The ... border is pretty long. Yet again there will be a spot where things will get hot.” Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of air strikes against the Ukrainian capital. Via AFP: Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram that Russia “again attacked Kyiv from the air”. “The attack was massive,” the statement added. “The enemy continues to use attack tactics in several waves, with intervals between groups of attacking drones.” He added that “all detected air targets moving in the direction of Kyiv were destroyed” by Ukrainian air defence systems. The attacks were carried out using Iranian-made Shahed drones, the statement added, citing preliminary information. Air alerts were also reported in the cities of Kharkiv and Chernivtsi. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top stories this morning: The Russian commander of a militia that conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week said on Wednesday his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory. And Russian forces carried out overnight drone attacks on Kyiv, officials said Thursday, continuing a month-long campaign of airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital. Military chiefs said Kyiv’s air defences destroyed all of the drones during the three-hour air attack, the twelfth this month. Here are the other key developments: Washington is looking into reports that American vehicles were used by Ukraine inside Russia, the White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Wednesday. He said the US has been clear with Kyiv that it does not support any such use of US-made equipment. The Kremlin said the use of US-made military hardware by pro-Ukraine fighters who conducted a raid on a Russian border region this week was testament to the West’s growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Russian military said on Tuesday it had routed militants who attacked the Russian border region of Belgorod with armoured vehicles the previous day, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. In Belgorod, nine people remain in hospital, utility supplies continue to be disrupted, and more than 500 people remain displaced after the cross-border incursion by anti-Russian partisans on Monday, according to Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Russian region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iranians on Wednesday to reconsider the supply of deadly drones to Russia. Iranian-made Shahed drones supplied to Moscow have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The simple question is this: what is your interest in being an accomplice to Russian terror?” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. “What is the benefit to Iran of such cynical killing?” Ukraine will not be able to join Nato as long as the war is going on, the alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday. “I think that everyone realised that, to become a member in the midst of a war, is not on the agenda,” Reuters reports he said at an event organised by the German Marshall Fund of the US in Brussels. “The issue is what happens when the war ends.” The Russian private army Wagner lost 20,000 fighters in the drawn-out battle for Bakhmut, according to the group’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He said about 20% of the 50,000 Russian prisoners recruited to fight in the 15-month war had died in the eastern Ukrainian city, and a similar number of its regular troop. The figure was in stark contrast with claims from Moscow that it has lost just over 6,000 troops in the war, and is higher than the official estimate of the Soviet losses in the Afghanistan war of 15,000 troops between 1979 and 1989. The World Health Organization assembly passed a motion on Wednesday condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities. The motion passed by 80 votes to nine, with 52 abstentions and 36 countries absent, Reuters reported. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development expects to spend €1.5bn (£1.3bn) in Ukraine next year in support of infrastructure and the economy, a senior source at the bank has said. It comes on top of €3bn already projected for 2022 and the remainder of 2023. The funds have helped the economy continue to function and ensure that there was no run on banks and that civil servants continued to be paid. The European Union has discussed sending Ukraine the profits from €196.6bn of Russian assets that are stuck inside the plumbing of global financial markets, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, has accused Washington and London of thwarting efforts to reach a settlement over the conflict in Ukraine and of turning a blind eye to what he said was increasing “terrorism and violence” visited on civilians by Ukraine. The first of three Russian hypersonic missile scientists to be arrested on suspicion of treason will go on trial next week, the court handling the case said on Wednesday. The criminal case against Anatoly Maslov, 76, will open in St Petersburg’s city court on 1 June, the court said on its website. The Netherlands wants to give Ukrainian pilots F-16 training as soon as possible, the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said on Wednesday in a letter to parliament. The training would be coordinated with Belgium, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and other countries could join, Ollongren added. Russia has announced that a court in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don will try five foreign men, including three British nationals, accused of fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Moscow. The trial will begin on 31 May on terrorism-linked allegations and other charges. The men are believed to face trial in absentia. Ukraine’s main Orthodox church said on Wednesday it had decided to switch to a calendar in which Christmas is celebrated on 25 December, a move that distances it from Russia. Ukrainian Christians, a majority of whom are Orthodox, have traditionally celebrated Christmas on 7 January alongside other predominantly Orthodox Christian countries. Germany will buy 18 Leopard 2 tanks and 12 self-propelled howitzers to replenish stocks depleted by deliveries to Ukraine, a member of the parliamentary budget committee that approved the purchase on Wednesday told Reuters. The tanks order will come to €525.6m (£457m) while the howitzers have a price tag of €190.7m; all of them are to be delivered by 2026 at the latest, said the finance ministry documents meant for the parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T09:00:22Z","webTitle":"New US rules could stem emissions from coal and gas power plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/11/new-rules-us-fossil-fuel-power-plant-emissions","fields":{"bodyText":"The US is set to impose new carbon pollution standards upon its coal- and gas-fired power plants, in a move that the Biden administration has hailed as a major step in confronting the climate crisis. Under new rules put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), new and existing power plants will have to meet a range of new standards to cut their emissions of planet-heating gases. This, the EPA predicts, will spur facilities to switch to cleaner energy such as wind and solar, install rarely used carbon capture technology or shut down entirely. In all, the EPA forecasts that the standards would prevent up to 617m tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted from coal and gas plants over the next two decades, which is equivalent to the yearly emissions of around half of all the cars in the US, or nearly double what the entire UK emits in a year. The new rule – if it survives a gamut of expected legal challenges – will help “safeguard the planet for future generations”, according to Michael Regan, the EPA administrator. “Not only will the proposal improve air quality nationwide, it will bring substantial health improvements to communities across this country, especially communities that have unjustly borne the burden of pollution,” Regan said. “The public and environmental benefits of this rule will be tremendous.” The new rule has been welcomed by environmental groups as a potentially pivotal moment that should, in combination with support for clean energy in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, drive down emissions in the power sector, which contributes about a quarter of the US’s overall greenhouse gas pollution. Researchers have warned that without further regulation of major pollution sources, the US – the world’s largest historical emitter of planet-heating gases – will miss its climate targets and risk unleashing ever worsening heatwaves, droughts, flooding and societal upheaval at home and overseas. “The EPA’s proposed rule sends an unequivocal signal to American power plant operators: the era of unlimited carbon pollution is over,” said Dan Lashof, US director of the World Resources Institute, who added that the regulation would result in more than an 80% reduction in carbon pollution from power plants by 2040 compared to 2005 levels. “This is a day for the history books, as the United States locks into the path toward a prosperous, clean and equitable future.,” Lashof said. The climate rule caps off a month of frenzied activity by the EPA, which has issued a flurry of new regulations aimed at curbing air toxins from industrial facilities and restricting planet-heating gases from new cars and trucks. In combination, these moves “have the potential to substantially advance clean power generation in the US”, according to Brian Murray, an environmental policy expert at Duke University. This is despite a series of controversial recent decisions by the Biden administration that risk undermining its own climate agenda, such as the approval of the Willow oil project in Alaska and the buildout of a growing export industry for liquified natural gas. Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen, an environmental campaign group, said younger voters in particular want the Biden administration “to make polluters clean up their act; in fact they want him to go further, faster. Vehicles and power plants are the two most polluting sectors in the US and the sticks that the EPA can wield here are essential.” The agency’s push to tackle the climate crisis still faces significant hurdles. The rightwing-dominated supreme court, which limited the scope of the EPA’s climate actions in a ruling last summer, may well intervene again after the almost inevitable lawsuits that coal-rich Republican states will probably launch. The supreme court previously stymied a previous, albeit more sweeping, attempt to regulate power plants by Barack Obama’s administration. EPA officials have said, however, they are confident the rule sits within the court’s view of the agency’s authority. “We feel really good that we are within those bounds,” Regan said. Meanwhile, a future Republican president, perhaps even Donald Trump, could undo the pollution regulations. The new climate rule already has a committed congressional foe in the form of Senator Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat who personally has coal interests in his native West Virginia. “This administration is determined to advance its radical climate agenda and has made it clear they are hellbent on doing everything in their power to regulate coal- and gas-fueled power plants out of existence,” said Manchin, who vowed, as chairman of the Senate’s energy and natural resources committee, to block all EPA nominees in protest over the rule. This rhetoric was echoed by the National Mining Association, which claimed that the EPA’s “disregard for the repercussions of premature coal plant retirements” posed serious risks. Several analyses have shown, however, that coal is being displaced in the US largely by economic forces, such as cheaper gas, rather than environmental regulation. The toll of fossil fuels remains immense, too – as well as spurring the climate crisis, the burning of fossil fuels is estimated to kill around 9 million people worldwide each year through air pollution. The EPA predicts the new climate rule will have $85bn in climate and public health benefits by 2042, preventing about 1,300 premature deaths and 300,000 severe asthma attacks in 2030 alone by reducing harmful air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The new climate rule will go through a period of public comment before a final version is implemented by the EPA, prior to next year’s presidential election."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/20/riyadh-air-new-saudi-airline-seeks-to-benefit-from-travel-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-20T08:00:53Z","webTitle":"Soft power: Saudi Arabia flexes muscles with launch of new Gulf airline Riyadh Air","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/riyadh-air-new-saudi-airline-seeks-to-benefit-from-travel-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/20/riyadh-air-new-saudi-airline-seeks-to-benefit-from-travel-boom","fields":{"bodyText":"As the deafening roar of an F35 fighter jet washes over the Paris air show, Tony Douglas allows himself a moment of nostalgia: he was formerly responsible for the UK government agency charged with buying the planes. Now he is in charge of a different aviation proposition, leading the launch of a new commercial airline belonging to the Saudi Arabian state. Riyadh Air, owned by the country’s Public Investment Fund, was first revealed in March alongside a provisional order for up to 72 Boeing 787 aeroplanes. Now its full launch comes as the global aviation industry races to meet resurgent demand for air travel after the end of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. The carrier is this week showing its new purple livery – on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner – to the industry at the Paris air show, after making its debut last week in the Saudi capital, with which it shares its name. It forms part of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to diversify its economy away from oil production under Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince who has taken a central role in ruling the country – including allegedly approving the murder of regime critic Jamal Khashoggi, according to US intelligence agencies. That murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 cast a cloud over Prince Mohammed’s reign for several years, but the prince has continued with plans for a new 100-mile-long megacity called Neom and massively increased tourism. Saudi Arabia already owns Saudia, formerly known as Saudi Arabian Airlines, which has been in operation since 1945 when it was gifted a plane by US president Franklin Roosevelt. However, many of its routes are geared towards passengers travelling to Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage. Rivals in the Middle East such as Qatar Airways, Dubai’s Emirates and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad have built up extensive networks with luxurious facilities for travellers in business and first class. Those fleets of planes are seen as important boosters of the countries’ “soft power”, carrying hundreds of millions of passengers each year through airports that have become hubs for connecting flights. Douglas, who previously led Etihad, insists that Riyadh is not aiming to compete directly with those other airlines. Instead, he emphasises the demand from Saudi Arabia’s iPhone-wielding population. “Are we designing to become another super-hub, another Dubai, another Doha? The simple answer is absolutely not. We’re designing to serve a nation, to catch up,” he says. “It’s going to take some time in terms of serving the kingdom in the way that we need to serve the kingdom.” Saudi Arabia is not the only market expecting booming aviation demand. European plane-maker Airbus announced a deal with Indian carrier Indigo for 500 of its bestselling A320 at the Paris show on Monday, thought to be the biggest single order in history. Hanging over the launch of the new airline, and the broader show, is the question of the carbon emissions that will be created by an enormous expansion of global air traffic. That question “will define ultimately who the winners and losers are”, says Douglas. “Anybody who doesn’t take it seriously will almost certainly fail.” Riyadh Air will have a sustainability advantage because it will only have the newest, more efficient planes. Douglas says that so-called sustainable aviation fuel – made from plants or using chemical processes powered by renewable electricity – will play an important role. However, he says he is unable to commit to using a certain proportion of the fuel because of uncertain future supply. The new airline’s local rivals are playing down the threat of a new player with deep pockets. Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates airline, last month told a travel conference that “I don’t see this as a threat to us”, according to a Financial Times report. Douglas says Riyadh Air will not be content with relying on its wealthy owner. “We cannot tolerate inefficiency because all that does is catch you up in the future. Commercial aviation is so competitive, if you start off lazy, you will die.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T15:00:29Z","webTitle":"Port Kembla rally to demand NSW site be ruled out as Aukus nuclear submarine base","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/06/port-kembla-rally-to-demand-nsw-site-be-ruled-out-as-aukus-nuclear-submarine-base","fields":{"bodyText":"Labor members are set to join unionists at a rally in Wollongong’s Port Kembla on Saturday to urge the Albanese government to rule out the location as a future base for the Aukus nuclear-powered submarines. Rally organisers say the debate is “a proxy battle” for Australia’s future and warn the delay in making a decision will only deter renewable energy investment in Port Kembla. The former Morrison government named it as well as Newcastle and Brisbane as three potential sites for a new east coast base, with reports earlier this year suggesting Port Kembla was favoured by defence planners. But in the wake of the defence strategic review, the Labor government has delayed a decision on the location and has signalled it will not limit itself to the Morrison government-era shortlist. It also now talks about a “facility”, not necessarily a base. A spokesperson for the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the government would “develop a process to consider all feasible options for an east coast facility to support Australia’s future submarine capability”. A decision would be made “late in this decade”, the spokesperson said. The government believes it can take the time to weigh up the decision, with the more immediate priority being infrastructure works at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, which will host rotational visits by US and UK submarines from 2027. But the rethink has failed to ease concerns of opponents of a new base in Port Kembla. Those opponents say they expect more than 1,000 people to march on Saturday. The South Coast Labour Council’s annual May Day march has been moved from Wollongong to Port Kembla to shine a spotlight on opposition to the proposed base. Arthur Rorris, the secretary of the South Coast Labour Council and a member of the Labor party, said the rally was attended last year by more than 750 people, but it would be “bigger this year than normal”. “That is a reflection of the concern in the community about the proposed east coast nuclear submarine base.” He expected “a very strong showing of Labor party membership”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Rorris said locals had “grave fears” that the prospect of a submarine base would crowd out potential energy investors. “That is why we are asking the federal government: rule it out, take it off the table and say that it will never be a nuclear base. Until that happens, economically and industrially, we have a major and unacceptable problem.” Rorris said the traditional coalmining and steelmaking region had been seen as “carbon central”, but a lot of work had been done to keep people together on the journey to a renewable energy future. “Many people are very, very pissed off, to be honest with you. We’re at the point where we’re able to get the fruits of all that work, now they want to turn this place into ground zero.” Rorris said it was a “choice between the industries of the future to save the planet versus the war machines that may well destroy it”. “We understand that unlike the Morrison government, this Albanese federal government is a bit more attuned to the feeling on this matter on the ground,” Rorris said. “I think they understand the alarm and I suspect that what is happening is that the defence department, which has a habit of getting its way on these things, hasn’t been able to convince the government as yet – as yet – to make a call on it. “We make no apologies for putting as much pressure as possible on the decision makers to rule out Port Kembla now, not later.” Some Labor party members plan to march as part of a newly formed anti-Aukus network, named Labor Against War. Marcus Strom, a spokesperson for Labor Against War and a former Albanese government press secretary, said the party had “a proud tradition of opposing the nuclear industry and wars of aggression”. “We are very worried about the direction the government is taking with Aukus, a Scott Morrison thought bubble agreed to by federal caucus without any debate in the party,” he said. “Australians do not want to be dragged into another US-led war.” To date the federal Labor caucus is largely united behind the Aukus agreement, even though some MPs have asked questions. But rank-and-file members who hold concerns are understood to have been emboldened to become more active after several prominent Labor figures including the former prime minister Paul Keating spoke out against Aukus. The Greens’ defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, who will address Saturday’s rally, said it was a “dishonest approach from the government to agree to an east cost submarine base and then refuse to tell anyone where it will be”. “There is no doubt that the civil revolt in the Illawarra has forced the government to, at least temporarily, step back from naming Port Kembla as the east coast nuclear submarine base,” he said. “The Albanese government knows the optics is dreadful of taking on an array of unions and an engaged local community who prize and protect the extraordinary anti-war history of the Illawarra, so they are putting the decision off as long as they can.” Shoebridge said the “inevitable exclusion zones” around a submarine base would “monopolise the port and strangle the exciting plans to make it a renewable energy services and export hub”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T06:00:26Z","webTitle":"Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra review: creative power behind stunning screen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/apr/05/samsung-galaxy-book-3-ultra-review-creative-power-behind-stunning-screen-laptop","fields":{"bodyText":"The top of Samsung’s new 2023 laptop line is the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra: a powerhouse 16in machine aiming squarely at Apple’s 16in MacBook Pro for creatives and gamers. A laptop called Ultra obviously doesn’t come cheap, costing from £2,449 ($2,200), which is about the same price as Windows 11 rivals from Dell and Razer but slightly cheaper than Apple’s top machines. The Ultra looks very similar to Samsung’s other minimalist Galaxy Book laptops from the last few years, only bigger, in contrast to frequently garish gaming PCs. It is surprisingly thin and light for a 16in laptop, weighing 1.78kg, which isn’t dramatically heavier than much smaller machines and much lighter than most of the competition. The star of the show is the simply stunning 16in 3K OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It is one of the best displays I’ve seen, with inky blacks, amazing contrast and accurate colours that practically burst out of the screen. Its peak brightness of about 500nits for HDR content is comfortably beaten by the searing brightness of the LCD-based MacBook Pro but in line with OLED competitors and certainly bright enough to look great. Below the screen is a big and good keyboard, with a solid typing experience and a fingerprint reader in the power button. Gamers may want more feedback but for writing it was excellent. It has a decent but not class-leading 1080p webcam with various tricks such as auto-panning and blur effects at the top of the screen. The mics are very good, and the set of four speakers is pretty immersive for a laptop. Specifications Screen: 16in 3K AMOLED 2880 x 1800 (120Hz; 201 PPI) Processor: Intel Core i7-13700H or i9-13900H (13th gen) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce RTX4050 (6GB) or 4070 (8GB) laptop GPU RAM: 16 or 32GB Storage: 512GB or 1TB Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 1080P Connectivity: wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.1, USB-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4, headphones, microSD, HDMI2.0 Dimensions: 355.4 x 250.4 x 16.5mm Weight: 1.79kg Two-stage power The Ultra is available in a small choice of configurations that vary by country, including models with an Intel Core i7-13700H processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX4050 graphics card, or a Core i9-13900H and RTX4070 at the top end as tested. Note, a model with 32GB of RAM or greater is not available in the UK, which may be a deal killer for some. As you would expect for the hardware, the Ultra is an extremely powerful machine, keeping pace with Apple’s top laptop and gaming rigs across a range of tests. It is able to produce high frame rates in a variety of demanding games at 1080p resolution with high graphics settings, which look fantastic on the glorious screen. The base of the laptop gets pretty hot, however, so I would not use it gaming on a lap. It also handles complex image and video editing, transcoding and other demanding tasks with aplomb for creative applications. But its maximum power is only available when it is plugged in and set to high performance mode. That’s typical of the kind of PC hardware it has inside but isn’t the case for Apple’s competitor. Even at full tilt, the fans in the Ultra manage to avoid being overly noisy compared with some hairdryer-like laptops. In more mundane day-to-day productivity work, it runs essentially silently, which is most appreciated. Battery life for productivity is fairly average, lasting about seven hours on a balanced workload of browsing, video calls and writing, which isn’t quite enough for a work day. It holds up better compared with the competition under intense loads, lasting just shy of three hours when pushed. A full charge takes about 75 minutes using the included 100W power adaptor. Sustainability Samsung does not provide an expected lifespan for the battery but it should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of its original capacity. The laptop is generally repairable priced on a case-by-case basis but not upgradeable. The laptop contains recycled plastic in its casing. Samsung offers trade-in and recycling schemes for some old devices. The company publishes annual sustainability reports but not impact assessments for individual products. Windows 11 + Samsung The Ultra runs Windows 11 out of the box but comes pre-installed with a large range of Samsung apps and tools. Generally, it ran smoothly and without issue. I removed the free trial of McAfee and several other unwanted apps. You may never use many of the 22 included Samsung apps and can safely uninstall them. But some, such as the quick settings tool, are very useful, allowing you to change system settings, performance modes, screen modes and other bits quickly and painlessly. About half of them are designed to link up with and sync content across other Samsung devices, which is handy if you happen to also have a modern Galaxy phone or any of the company’s accessories such as earbuds. For example, you can control a Samsung phone using the keyboard and mouse on the laptop. Some of the other tools, such as the Intel connectivity performance suite, give you much greater control over the hardware within the laptop, which is welcome given this is a power-user machine. Price The Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra starts at £2,449 ($2199.99) with an Intel Core i7, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU. The Core i9 version with GeForce RTX 4070 costs £3,049. For comparison, the equivalent Razer Blade 16 starts at £2,699, the Dell XPS 15 at £3,099, the Alienware m16 at £2,149, and the Apple 16in MacBook Pro at £2,699. Verdict The Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is the first Samsung laptop to really compete on a level with arch-rival Apple’s big MacBook Pro, delivering the raw power, quality build and stunning screen required by creatives and gamers alike. It is a thoroughly impressive machine, offering the ability to seamlessly switch between simple productivity work, serious photo and video editing, and then perform as a proper gaming rig at the end of the day, all without looking out of place. There are few machines that manage that quite so successfully, and in such a light and compact body for a 16in laptop. The enormous trackpad is great, and the keyboard is really good for writing, but gamers might want a bit more feedback. It is very expensive, even if competitively priced for this type of machine. It could do with longer productivity battery life. For those looking for a Windows alternative to a 16in MacBook Pro for creative work or a more subtle gaming PC they can lug to the office when needed, the Galaxy Book 3 Ultra is right up there with the best available. Pros: stunning 16in OLED screen, powerful choice of top Intel and Nvidia chips, enormous trackpad, good keyboard for writing, subtle design, good speakers and mics, decent webcam, compact and light for a workstation. Cons: expensive, no 32GB RAM option in the UK, only HDMI2.0, max performance only available when plugged in, productivity battery life is a bit short, design might be too businesslike for a gaming laptop."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T14:39:56Z","webTitle":"Finland opens nuclear power plant amid concerns of European energy war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","fields":{"bodyText":"Europe’s first nuclear power plant to open in 15 years began production in Finland on Saturday, at a crucial moment for energy supply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The much-delayed Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor started test production, delivering power to the national grid, which over time is expected to reduce the need for electricity imports and lead to lower prices. It comes amid growing fears of an energy war in Europe, after Moscow threatened to close a major gas pipeline to Germany if European countries ban Russian oil imports. Once fully operational Olkiluoto 3, operated by TVO (Teollisuuden Voima), is expected to meet 14% of Finland’s electricity demand, reducing the need for imports from Russia, Sweden and Norway. “Olkiluoto 3 will decrease Finland’s import dependency and it will become a cheaper price zone,” Aurora Energy Research economist Alexander Esser told Reuters. Finland’s first new nuclear plant in four decades, Olkiluoto 3 had originally been due to open in 2009 but was plagued by technological problems that became the subject of lawsuits. The plant started test production at just over 0.1 gigawatt, a small fraction of its capacity, with increase to full, regular electricity output planned by the end of July. Finland’s net imports of power averaged 13 terawatt hours (TWh) over the last few years, which should drop to 5 to 8 TWh by 2025 with Olkiluoto 3 in operation. TVO said in a statement: “OL3 significantly improves Finland’s electricity self-sufficiency and helps in achieving carbon neutrality goals.” The invasion of Ukraine has forced European governments to reconsider their reliance on Russian energy. Russia supplies about 40% of Europe’s gas and over a quarter of its crude oil. Germany’s economy minister says his country wants to virtually end the importation of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. Germany currently gets about half of its coal and oil from Russia. The German government last month halted the Nord Stream 2 project intended to bring additional natural gas from Russia to Germany. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, threatened to impose an embargo on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany this week, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports entirely. The European Commission has proposed plans to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy. British and European gas prices both hit record highs earlier this month, as the war continued to wreak havoc on energy markets, threatening to worsen the cost-of-living crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Starwatch: Auriga hidden in plain sight beside its famous neighbours","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2023/jan/30/starwatch-capellas-star-power-saves-auriga-from-obscurity","fields":{"bodyText":"This week, search out the northern constellation of Auriga, the charioteer.

The chart shows the view from London facing south, and looking high up in the sky, towards the zenith. In Greek mythology, the constellation is sometimes associated with Phaethon, the son of Helios. Phaethon is said to have persuaded his father to let him drive the chariot containing the sun for a single day. He was so reckless, however, that the chariot careened first too close then too far away from Earth. Eventually, Zeus killed Phaethon with a thunderbolt to restore normality but the damage was done. The story was used to explain why some parts of the world were too cold, and other parts too hot for human habitation. From the UK, Auriga is visible all year round. It can also be seen from the southern hemisphere at this time of year.

When I woke up on the sofa 15 minutes later, the crossword puzzle in my lap was complete. These findings are a little hard to quantify, because I slept through them. Perhaps I completed the puzzle just before I conked out. It’s possible, I suppose, that a mischievous person stole the crossword from my lap, filled it in and put it back. Of course I prefer the idea that I finished the crossword myself, while unconscious, because it reinforces my assertion that I’m getting things done even when my eyes are closed. This week saw the publication – in the journal Sleep Health – of a study that found a “modest causal association between habitual daytime napping and larger total brain volumes”. The study didn’t uncover any specific cognitive benefits, but other studies have. Short naps of between five and 15 minutes can result in an almost immediate boost of cognitive function. Longer naps produce a subsequent period of temporary impairment – drowsiness, basically – but can thereafter improve cognitive function for many hours. Like most people, I draw comfort from any study that purports to show real benefit resulting from something I can’t help doing anyway. For some years I’ve been in the habit of taking a brief nap every day at around the 2pm mark. This is in no way planned or voluntary: I nod out wherever I am, with very little warning. Drool may or may not be involved. I usually wake within 15 minutes or so, feeling refreshed, bewildered and, depending on how I was sitting when I dropped off, maybe a little stiff-necked. It’s easy for me to indulge this habit, because I work from home and have done for 20 years. I don’t have to face the indignity of falling asleep in an open-plan office, although I don’t think indignity would be any kind of deterrent now. But given the demonstrable cognitive benefits of a brief snooze – and the fact that daytime nappers are, to some extent, genetically predisposed to do so – we should perhaps be thinking again about devoting a little floor space to the practice. Before the pandemic it seemed there was a trend toward workplace napping – Google and other tech companies installed sleep rooms and sleep “pods” in their offices. Co-working office-space chains offered nap areas as part of the package. In cities across Europe “pod hotels” sprang up, offering workers on the move a place to recharge. I tried one in central London five years ago – an £18-an-hour nap room. Perversely I had trouble dropping off in the strange, hyper-calm environment, although I slept like a baby on the bus home. Since the pandemic the naptime trend has slowed. When Google first let its workers back in after lockdown, the sleep pods were off-limits. And the looming threat of recession isn’t exactly conducive to arguments in favour of letting employees rest more. Nowadays stories about sleeping at work seem to involve punishment. Last year Elon Musk put bedrooms in Twitter’s offices – not so workers could nap in the day, but so they could stay all night. The news about daily siestas isn’t all good. A recent study of 3,000 people from the Spanish region of Murcia associated daytime naps of 30 minutes or more with higher rates of obesity. The real truth is that most of us are getting less sleep than ever – any rise in daytime napping may be a direct symptom of that. The pandemic left one big mark on employment culture – a lot of us now work from home for at least part of the week. As I know well, it’s easy to fall into the nap habit when no one is looking. And as I know better, the nap habit, once acquired, is difficult to shake, no matter who is looking. I’ll be with you in 15 minutes, and don’t touch my crossword puzzle.

Rafael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was inspecting the state of Europe’s largest nuclear plant following last week’s breach in the Kakhovka dam downstream on the Dnipro River. He said IAEA inspectors would remain at the site. “What is essential for the safety of this plant is that the water that you see behind me stays at that level,” Grossi said in two tweets issued from near the station, including next to a pond that supplies water for cooling. “With the water that is here the plant can be kept safe for some time. The plant is going to be working to replenish the water so that safety functions can continue normally.” Grossi said the visit, his third to the plant in southern Ukraine since Russian forces occupied it in the first days of their February 2022 invasion, had gathered “a good amount of information for an assessment”. Russia and Ukraine have repeatedly accused each other of shelling near the plant, endangering its safe operation. The station’s six reactors are now in shutdown. An IAEA spokesperson said gunfire briefly halted Grossi’s convoy as it headed back to Ukrainian-held territory after the visit, but the delegation was in no immediate danger. A Russian energy industry official was earlier cited by Tass news agency as accusing Ukraine of opening fire at the convoy. Earlier in the day, Grossi said it was unrealistic to expect Moscow and Kyiv to sign a document on the site’s security while fighting raged nearby. The Kakhovka reservoir was normally used to refill the cooling pond adjacent to the plant but cannot do so now because of its falling water level after the breach, officials say. Instead, the pond, which is separated from the reservoir, can be replenished using deep underground wells, they say. Grossi was earlier quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the situation at the site was “serious”. “On the one hand, we can see that the situation is serious, the consequences [of the dam’s destruction] are there, and they are real,” he said. “At the same time, there are measures that are being taken to stabilise the situation.” Grossi’s trip was delayed by a day for security reasons amid heavy fighting. Russian forces captured both the nuclear plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent them into Ukraine in February 2022. Grossi has repeatedly called for an end to fighting in the vicinity of the facility to avoid any catastrophic accidents. Power lines have been repeatedly cut. There are diesel generators at the plant, which also has alternative water sources.

A major announcement 18 months in the making is expected when the UK prime minister meets his Australian counterpart, Anthony Albanese, and US president Joe Biden. In response to concerns about Beijing’s economic coercion and foreign policy aims, the UK’s defence and security strategy for the 2020s is being updated, and the revised version is due to be published on Monday. It will address “increasingly concerning behaviour” by Chinese president Xi Jinping’s government, the “grave risks” posed by Russia after a renewed assault on Ukraine and “hybrid threats” to Britain’s economy and energy security, No 10 said. Before his trip to California, Sunak hailed “global alliances” – such as the one formed between the UK, US and Australia in September 2021 – as “our greatest source of strength and security”. He added: “I am travelling to the US today to launch the next stage of the Aukus nuclear submarine programme, a project which is binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.” The UK would be “secure, prosperous and standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our partners”, thanks to the programme and the updated Integrated Review, Sunak said. He will hold meetings on Sunday night and Monday, before flying back home before the budget on Wednesday. The visit threatened to cast a shadow over Sunak’s trip on Friday to Paris, given the French government reacted with consternation to its own submarine deal with Australia being scrapped a year and a half ago. Britain is stepping up efforts to increase its influence in the Indo-Pacific, and Sunak hopes the trilateral summit on Monday will demonstrate his commitment to standing up to China, which senior Conservative MPs have urged him to take a tougher stance on. The Guardian revealed earlier this week that Sunak had expressed delight to fellow ministers about the outcome of negotiations, with multiple sources saying they believed the eight nuclear-powered submarines would be based on British designs. Such a move would safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness, since the full fleet may not be seaworthy until the 2040s. Reports this week suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US. Under the three-way deal the US and UK will agree to share secret reactor technology. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor – putting its diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut”, according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. Charles Edel, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, has described the Aukus pact as a calculated gamble. “It’s a bet that by further integrating industrial capacities and increasing interoperability it will significantly augment the capabilities of our allies, make them more powerful, and ultimately change Beijing’s calculations about its security environment,” he said. “And that by doing so, it will help stabilise a region that has been badly destabilised by China’s rapid expansion of military capabilities and increasingly aggressive foreign policy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-29T09:08:59Z","webTitle":"Weather tracker: power prices dip to negative in Europe amid clean energy boost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/29/weather-tracker-power-prices-dip-to-negative-in-europe-amid-clean-energy-boost","fields":{"bodyText":"Over the last week, several European countries had power prices in the wholesale energy market dip into negative values during daylight hours. The decline in prices was mostly driven by the abundance of available energy generated by renewable sources, combined with the relatively low demand for energy for heating or cooling, caused by normal springtime temperatures. Negative prices often occur when there is an excess supply of electricity in the market. This can happen when renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, or hydro produce a large quantity of electricity that exceeds demand and cannot be stored for later use. In such cases, producers may offer negative prices to incentivise wholesale consumers to take the surplus electricity off the grid and avoid overloading the system. This situation occurred due to an area of high pressure dominating across much of central and north-west Europe, providing lots of solar power generation across the area. Meanwhile, Finland experienced an oversupply of hydroelectric power resulting from excessive springtime meltwater, which in turn led to negative prices here as well. High pressure will remain positioned over Britain and Ireland through the rest of this week and most of next week, leading to predominantly dry and settled conditions across much of the UK, central and northern Europe. Plenty of sunshine is expected, potentially leading to further opportunities for low or negative prices during the daylight hours. Spring-time school holidays including half-term in the UK and Whitsuntide in Germany have pushed many families to take their kids closer to the Mediterranean to enjoy some warmth and the seaside. Nevertheless, areas of low pressure will drive the development of showers and some thunderstorms across popular European resorts, some of these heavy with the risk of frequent lightning and surface flooding. Over in the western Pacific, Typhoon Mawar has reduced in strength to a category 3 typhoon. Now situated south-east of Taiwan in the Philippine Sea, Mawar’s current projections forecast the typhoon to continue to degrade while veering to the north-east before dissipating by the weekend. While unlikely, the greatest forecast error suggests Mawar could skim the north-east of Taiwan, bringing blustery conditions to the island."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/audio/2023/jan/19/the-power-of-the-union-politics-weekly-uk","type":"audio","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-19T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"The power of the union?

Russia has unleashed a missile barrage including the use of hypersonic missiles – that cannot be intercepted – targeting energy infrastructure across Ukraine, in the largest such attack in three weeks. The Ukrainian president said critical infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile strike on a residential area in the western Lviv region – 440 miles from any military battlefield – according to emergency services. Three buildings were destroyed by fire after the strike, and rescue workers were combing through rubble looking for more possible victims. A sixth person died during strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region, its governor said. What did Russia use in the barrage? Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which the president, Vladimir Putin, regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which Nato has no answer. What else is happening? The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, confirmed one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents were without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Mitch McConnell in hospital after fall in Washington DC The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, was taken to hospital in Washington DC after he tripped and fell at a hotel. “This evening, Leader McConnell tripped at a local hotel during a private dinner. He has been admitted to the hospital where he is receiving treatment,” David Popp, the communications director for McConnell, said in a statement. In 2019 McConnell, who is 81 and a survivor of childhood polio, tripped and fell at his home in Kentucky, fracturing his shoulder. The Senate has been without several members recently because of illness. The office of Dianne Feinstein, 90, said the senator was taken to hospital last week to be treated for shingles. Senator John Fetterman, 53, who suffered a stroke during his campaign last year, was expected to remain out for some weeks as he received care for clinical depression. When will McConnell be back? It is unclear if McConnell will be discharged today and if that would have an effect on scheduled votes. The South Dakota senator John Thune is the Senate’s No 2 Republican. Tucker Carlson, who ‘passionately hates’ Trump, shows more Capitol footage The Fox News host Tucker Carlson told an associate he “hated” Donald Trump “passionately”, new filings in a $1.6bn defamation suit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems revealed. Even as the filings were reported on Tuesday, Carlson continued to broadcast January 6 security footage in his attempt to cast the deadly attack on Congress as “peaceful chaos” arising from a protest of Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden. “We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can’t wait,” Carlson said in a text on 4 January 2021, two days before the riot. He also wrote: “I hate him passionately … What he’s good at is destroying things. He’s the undisputed world champion of that. He could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.” Many observers think the Dominion suit, over the broadcast of lies about electoral fraud by Trump and his allies, could prove seriously costly to Fox News. Hosts and executives up to and including Rupert Murdoch have been shown to have said Trump was lying, and to have ridiculed surrogates, including Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, but to have broadcast their claims regardless. What did Fox News really think of Trump and the 2020 election? Even as they went on air to cast doubt about whether the vote went off fairly, many Fox News personalities privately doubted Trump’s claims. “He’s acting like an insane person,” Sean Hannity, one of the network’s best-known personalities, allegedly said of Trump, according to a Dominion court filing. What has Stephen Colbert said about Carlson? “You’d think that once the people gaslighting you on a daily basis have been revealed to be liars – say, in multiple text messages and a $1.6bn court filing by Dominion Voting Systems – they would pump the brakes. But apparently, some people are just addicted to being dicks,” he said. In other news … Chaim Topol, the Israeli actor and singer best known for his performance as Tevye the milkman in Fiddler on the Roof, has died aged 87. Topol, who was widely known by his last name alone, died at home in Israel on Wednesday surrounded by his family, local media reported. A California jury awarded a Black mother and her two daughters more than $8m after they were unreasonably detained by police during a stop for coffee. Police in Castro Valley said they were investigating car break-ins when Aasylei Loggervale and her two daughters were handcuffed in a parking lot. Members of the House and Senate were informed yesterday that hackers may have gained access to their sensitive personal data in a breach of a Washington DC health insurance marketplace. Employees of the lawmakers and their families were also affected. Military members and veterans of the Afghanistan war offered harrowing eyewitness testimony of the chaotic and deadly withdrawal from the country’s longest conflict, during an hours-long congressional hearing yesterday. They also pleaded with Congress to help the Afghan allies left behind. A fresh atmospheric river is expected to bring more weather chaos to California as the state is still digging itself out from heavy snow that left mountain communities buried for weeks. Northern and central California are expected to receive most of the rain, which could cause flash flooding. Stat of the day: California governor halts $54m contract with Walgreens – ‘We’re done’ The California governor, Gavin Newsom, withdrew a $54m contract with Walgreens yesterday after the pharmacy chain indicated it would not sell an abortion pill by mail in some conservative-led states. Newsom ordered state officials not to renew a contract with Walgreens to buy specialty pharmacy prescription drugs for California’s prison healthcare system, including antiviral and antifungal drugs and medication used for congestive heart failure. Walgreens has received about $54m from the contract, which expires on 30 April. Newsom’s office said the state would buy the drugs elsewhere. “California will not stand by as corporations cave to extremists and cut off critical access to reproductive care and freedom,” Newsom said. Don’t miss this: Scabby the Rat is an American labor icon. Why are his manufacturers disowning him? In New York – a city poised to hire its first “rat tsar” after rat sightings doubled in the past year – streetside rodents are fairly commonplace. But the rat stationed on a Union Square curb is something of a different beast. This one is roughly 10ft tall, with incisors the size of iPads. Its eyes are bloodshot, its claws extended, and its belly marked with what look like open, oozing sores. Depending who you ask, its name is Scabby, or just the Rat. He appears beside workers nationwide – at an Amazon warehouse in Illinois over the summer of 2021, at a Philadelphia Starbucks the following July. The rat elicits polarizing opinions (they tend to fall neatly along worker-management lines). But to both sides, Scabby is, as one organizer told NPR in 2021, an “iconic symbol of a labor dispute”. Climate check: the 10 worst places to live in US for air pollution The worst 10 hotspots for fine particle air pollution in the US have been revealed by the Guardian in an analysis. The top spot is not a traffic-clogged metropolis or renowned heavy industry zone but a small town surrounded by farmland and mountains. The findings, based on a model developed by a team of researchers at institutions including the University of Washington, show that, across the contiguous US, the neighborhoods burdened by the worst pollution are overwhelmingly the same places where Black and Hispanic populations live. Race is more of a predictor of air pollution exposure than income level, researchers found. Check your own neighborhood’s air pollution in our interactive tool. And read on for the US’s worst hotspots. Last Thing: cocaine cat – Cincinnati zoo takes in exotic feline found with drug in system A wild cat captured earlier this year with cocaine in its system is now living at an Ohio zoo. The African serval known as Amiry was captured in late January after being spotted in a tree in Oakley, a neighborhood in Cincinnati, the local news outlet WLWT5 reported. “It was sure a sight to see, and after talking to the cat expert, he said we did a great job. And also [we were] pretty lucky because this cat could’ve shredded us apart and killed us,” Troy Taylor, the chief of the Hamilton county, Ohio, dog warden’s office, told WKRC. Medical examiners treating the cat discovered it had been exposed to cocaine, after testing it for narcotics exposure. Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: The chief of mercenary group Wagner has reportedly accused Moscow’s top brass of deceiving Russians about the course of Ukraine’s offensive and pointed to Kyiv’s progress on the battlefield. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, accused opponents of waging a campaign to discredit him and force him out of office on Wednesday after a rift with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Reuters reported. EU governments agreed to an 11th package of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping other countries and companies from circumventing existing measures. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has said all Nato allies are backing a plan to give Ukraine a fast track to Nato membership of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year. Vladimir Putin announced that new Sarmat nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon enter service. The missiles are designed to carry out nuclear strikes on targets thousands of missiles away but their deployment has proceeded slower than planned. He reportedly said Moscow had seen a “lull” in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. Russia’s top investigator reportedly claimed that over 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy accepted in a BBC interview that progress in the country’s current counteroffensive against Russian forces had been “slower than desired”. Zelenskiy told the Ukraine Recovery conference that Ukraine had made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before and could become an engine for green world growth and security for decades. Rishi Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast-track recovery and support this “help Ukraine unleash its potential”. “It’s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they’ve inflicted. So we’re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,” the prime minister said at the conference, held in London. Russian air defences downed three drones in the Moscow region on Wednesday, the defence ministry said, in what it called an attempted Ukrainian attack, Reuters reported. The chief of mercenary group Wagner accused Moscow of deceiving Russians about the course of Ukraine’s offensive and pointed to Kyiv’s progress on the battlefield, AFP reports. Early this month Kyiv’s military launched its counteroffensive in the east and south of the country in an effort to claw back territory lost since last year. Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Ukraine’s offensive is failing. But the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces had for months led an assault for towns in eastern Ukraine including Bakhmut, accused the defence ministry of not telling the truth and losing territory to Ukrainian troops. “They are misleading the Russian people,” he said in an audio message released by his spokespeople. A number of villages, including Piatykhatky has been lost, Prigozhin said, pointing to a lack of arms and ammunition. “Huge chunks have been handed over to the enemy,” he said, adding: “All of this is being totally hidden from everyone,” “One day Russia will wake up to discover that Crimea too has been handed over to Ukraine,” he said. Kyiv has reported modest gains, retaking eight settlements in the first cautious steps of a fightback against entrenched Russian positions. The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine plans to resume pumping water from what remains of the massive reservoir behind a nearby dam that burst two weeks ago, the UN nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday. Reuters reports: The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week it was unclear whether it would be possible to pump water from the reservoir to cool reactors and spent fuel at Europe’s biggest nuclear plant given how much the reservoir’s level has fallen. While the plant can fall back on other water sources, including a cooling pond with what the IAEA says is months’ worth of water in it, whatever can be pumped from the reservoir should buy more time before stocks have to be replenished. “Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is planning to resume pumping water that still remains accessible despite a major loss of water in the Kakhovka reservoir caused by the destruction of the downstream dam earlier this month,” the IAEA said in a statement. For the past two weeks, Zaporizhzhia has received its cooling water from the reserves of a water outlet from a nearby thermal power plant. That so-called discharge channel has also been used to replace water in the cooling pond that evaporated, the IAEA said Kyiv is “not optimistic” about the renewal of an agreement allowing grain from Ukraine to reach the global market, a senior Ukrainian government official has said. “We are not optimistic at this time,” deputy prime minister for the restoration of Ukraine, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told reporters on Wednesday, according to AFP. “Since the beginning of May, the corridor efficiency has decreased,” he said, adding that Ukraine recently exported more agricultural products via other routes than through the corridors under the agreement. The deal that grants safe passage for Ukrainian grain to be exported via the Black Sea was signed by Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN in July 2022. It was renewed again in May but for only two months, until 17 July. Speaker after speaker at the conference drew applause by saying that Russia will have to contribute to the cost of Ukraine’s recovery - put at $400bn by the World Bank in May. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: “Let’s be clear: Russia is behind the destruction of Ukraine. And Russia will end up bearing the cost of rebuilding Ukraine.” The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the aggressor must be held responsible. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: “It is clear that Russia must pay for the destruction it has inflicted. This is why we are working with our allies to explore legal avenues for the use of Russian assets.” Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said his country was preparing “a fair mechanism that will allow us to confiscate up to $500bn of Russian assets frozen in the west”. But a preliminary paper prepared by the European Commission suggests no legal avenue has been found to seize frozen Russian sovereign assets that does not risk legal challenge. The commission, according to a paper seen by Bloomberg, is proposing a windfall tax could be imposed on Russian companies, but that it is not likely to raise much money. The UK this week proposed that sanctions can be kept in place until Russia has agreed to pay reparations, a route that might lead Russian businesses to put pressure on the Russian government to offer reparations. In the immediate future, Shmyhal said his country needed $14.1bn for 2023 alone and faced a shortfall of $6.5bn that he hoped would be overcome at the conference. Despite it not being a pledging conference, Washington announced an additional $1.3bn directed mainly towards its essential infrastructure and a green power industry. The US promised credit guarantees from the World Bank reaching $3bn over three years to finance Ukrainian public services and £240m of bilateral aid, intended in particular for mine clearance and humanitarian projects. Germany announced an additional €381m of humanitarian aid in 2023, and Paris, €40m, for emergency reconstruction and medical equipment in particular. On Tuesday, the European Commission had proposed an aid package of €50bn until 2027. But the thrust of the conference was to convince sceptical if well disposed private investors that Ukraine is a politically and militarily safe country in which to invest, and a vibrant civil society, and a reformed judiciary, will block the return of corrupt oligarchs once peace returns. In a show of support, thousands of businesses with a capitalisation of $1trillion signed a “Ukraine business compact”, an initiative inviting companies from all over the world to commit to supporting the reconstruction of Ukraine. Zelenskiy has enlisted BlackRock and JPMorgan to advise on the Ukraine Development Fund, a vehicle that seeks to mobilise capital from private and public sector investors toward rebuilding the Ukrainian economy. Clearing the landmines in Ukraine will require an operation comparable to clearing Europe of explosive hazards after the second world war, the UN said on Wednesday. The task will need up to $300m a year over the next five years to clear those landmines causing the biggest drag on Ukraine’s economy, Paul Heslop, the head of UN mine action for the UN Development Programme in Ukraine, was quoted by AFP as saying. “What we’re facing in Ukraine is very much what was faced in Europe at the end of world war two,” he told a news conference in Geneva. He said Europe solved its explosive hazard problem within 15 years of the end of the war. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, accused opponents of waging a campaign to discredit him and force him out of office on Wednesday after a rift with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Reuters reports. The former boxing champion’s political future is uncertain after a public outcry over the deaths of three people locked out of an air raid shelter during a Russian attack on Kyiv this month. An audit ordered by Zelenskiy found only 15% of Kyiv’s 4,655 bomb shelters were suitable and only 44% were freely accessible, and prosecutors on Tuesday served a formal “notice of suspicion” to a senior Kyiv security official accused of mismanagement. Klitschko posted a video message on Telegram in which he appeared to criticise investigations over the situation with the shelters, decrying “endless searches” that were making it hard to run the capital efficiently. He said: Today there is a heavy campaign to discredit the capital authorities and personally me. In wartime, they bring chaos to the management of the capital. My colleague Patrick Wintour has more on the UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, indicating that Nato allies back fast-track membership for Ukraine of the kind offered to Sweden and Finland earlier this year (See post at 15:00). Speaking on the margins of the two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London, Cleverly said the UK was “very, very supportive” of Ukraine being able to join the alliance without the usual need for it to meet the conditions set out in a Nato membership action plan (Map), he reports. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, was more cautious but said circumstances had changed since 2008 when Ukraine was last offered Nato membership on the condition it met the terms set out in an action plan. You can read the full story here: Ukraine expects to be invited to join Nato with an open date at the alliance’s summit in Vilnius next month, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff said on Wednesday. “We expect that Ukraine will be invited to Nato with an open date,” Andre Yermak told a webinar held by the Atlantic Council thinktank, according to Reuters. However, on Monday, Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said Nato leaders would not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at the summit in Vilnius in mid-July. Yermak said that consultations were ongoing between the US and Ukraine on measures that Nato leaders would approve in Vilnius to bolster Ukraine’s security until it receives the alliance’s collective security guarantee. US bomber jets have landed in Sweden for the first time in modern history for training exercises with the Nato invitee, the military said Wednesday. AFP reports: Sweden, which abandoned two centuries of military non-alignment to seek Nato membership last year, announced earlier this month that it was ready to host Nato troops and material on its soil even before it becomes a member of the alliance. Two American B-1B Lancers landed at Lulea-Kallax airport in northern Sweden on Monday 19 June, the military said. “We are carrying out a joint exercise, both the air force and the army, with the Bomber Task Force,” air force spokeswoman Louise Levin told AFP. She did not say how long the exercises would last… Sweden has been a Nato “invitee” since June 2022, but its membership bid, which must be ratified by all 31 member states, has been blocked by Turkey and Hungary. A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee said on Monday the country’s defence must adapt to focus on the threat posed by Russia and a military attack could not be ruled out. Andriy Kostin, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, has tweeted to say his team are coordinating efforts to document and investigate alleged Russian war crimes. He said: We must modernise our approaches, practices, and techniques. I told colleagues about the ‘Standards for War Crimes Investigation’ developed by the prosecutor general’s office of Ukraine with the support of our international partners. I emphasised the importance of using modern IT solutions to collect and store evidence and organise the work of prosecutors and investigators. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires of the war: Kyiv said the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine earlier this month caused an estimated $1.5bn in damages to the environment, AFP reports. Kyiv has accused Moscow of “ecocide” by blowing up the Soviet-era dam on the Dnipro River, while Russia has blamed Ukraine. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has said the “preliminary estimates” of $1.5bn in environmental damages following the dam breach do not include “losses to agriculture, infrastructure, housing, and the cost of rebuilding the plant itself”. We have some updates on the new sanctions the EU has agreed to be taken against Russia (See post at 15:16). The new package forbids transit via Russia of an expanded list of goods and technology which might aid Russia’s military or security sector. The EU package also extends the suspension of EU broadcasting licences of five Russian state-controlled media, Reuters reports. To curb the practice of ships loading Russian crude oil or petroleum products at sea, the package bans access to EU ports for ships which engage in ship-to-ship transfers if there is cause to suspect the cargo was of Russian origin. The package adds a further 71 persons and 33 entities to those banned from the EU and with EU assets frozen. The deal, in the making since April, had been held up by objections from Hungary and Greece over the listing by Ukraine of some of their companies as sponsors of war, because they did business with Russia or in other ways contributed to Moscow’s war effort, according to Reuters. The EU has agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. Nato leaders are expected to endorse Ukraine’s membership aspiration at a summit in July, but the alliance is wary of letting the country in during a war, according to reports. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, on Wednesday indicated the UK would be “very supportive” if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. Vladimir Putin reportedly said Moscow had seen a “lull” in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president said on Wednesday that Russia’s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles would soon be deployed for combat duty. Russia’s top investigator reportedly claimed that over 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been “slower than desired”, the BBC reported on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president has said that his county has made the west, including the EU, more united than ever before, in an address by video link to more than 1,000 businesses and foreign ministers at a two-day Ukraine Recovery conference in London. Zelenskiy also urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. Rishi Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast-track recovery and support this “help Ukraine unleash its potential”. “It’s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they’ve inflicted. So we’re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,” the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, has been cited by the Kyiv Independent as having said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference that his country is completing the transfer of all of its helicopters to Ukraine. The EU on Wednesday agreed an 11th package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports. Sweden, which holds the bloc’s rotating presidency, said the new measures were approved at a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. As part of the package, the bloc has put three Hong Kong-based companies on a list of firms to which the EU restricts exports of sensitive technologies, a document seen by AFP showed. Five companies from mainland China included in an earlier proposal were dropped from the list, a diplomat said, after Beijing pushed Brussels to take them off. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last February, the EU has adopted 10 sanctions packages against Russian individuals and companies, inflicting economic and making financing the war more difficult. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, indicated the UK would be “very supportive” if Ukraine was able to go through a simplified process for joining Nato. He suggested the UK would back suggestions Ukraine would not be required to go through the membership action plan (Map) stage of joining the military alliance. The Map process sees candidate countries receive assessments and advice as they take steps to meet Nato criteria on defence and other matters. If Ukraine effectively skipped this, it would put them in a category with new member Finland. By contrast, North Macedonia took part in a 20-year Map programme before its 2020 entry. Speaking at a press conference at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London, Cleverly said: “We have seen Ukraine evolve, and evolve incredibly quickly. “Jens Stoltenberg at the Nato informal foreign ministers (summit) said that actually, many of the requirements of membership action plan are actually being delivered. “The reform of their armed forces is happening whilst engaged in conflict. “I think the UK’s position would be very, very supportive if we moved on from the membership action plan recognising that the offer to both Sweden and Finland didn’t require that and Ukrainians have demonstrated their commitment to reform the military for requirement of Nato membership through their actions on the battlefield. “And I think all Nato allies recognise that.” The UK has pledged to offer new virtual reality (VR) training for at-sea Ukrainian cadets as part of a new package of support. The UK government said the training would be provided through VR headsets to help participants practise for real-life scenarios. Ukrainians will also be sponsored to take part in three-year cadetships to UK container ships and other large vessels, with the new package confirmed as the transport secretary, Mark Harper, appeared at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said: Our support for Ukraine and its people is unwavering, and we’re not going to let Russia’s abhorrent actions sink Ukraine’s great reputation in areas like seafaring By sharing the UK’s world-renowned expertise in aviation and seafaring, we are steadfast in our commitment to ensuring Ukraine’s transport system recovers from Putin’s illegal invasion. The Department for Transport will also support secondments for Ukraine’s air traffic controllers to train in the UK, with the latest funding following on from £10m previously announced to help repair Ukraine’s rail infrastructure. Harper joined other UK ministers in appearing at the conference, which was opened by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, and addressed via video-link by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Vladimir Putin said in remarks shown on Russian state television on Wednesday that Moscow had seen a “lull” in the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and that Kyiv had suffered heavy losses in attacks in the south. The Russian president also said that although Ukraine retained offensive potential, Kyiv already understood that it had “no chance” in its counteroffensive, Reuters reports. Kyiv’s forces have had “partial success” in the last day and are digging in and attacking on the southern front, while weathering a big Russian assault in the east, a senior Ukrainian defence official said on Wednesday. None of these claims could immediately be independently verified. Ursula von der Leyen has said she proposed to EU members states to cover 45% of all the financial needs of Ukraine until 2027. Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery International Conference in London, the European Commission president said: Until 2027, Ukraine’s remaining fiscal gap is about 60 billion euros. The needs for fast recovery are about 50 billion euros. That makes in total €110bn until 2027 that are not covered. Therefore, yesterday I proposed to EU member states to cover 45% of this gap – this is in total €50bn for Ukraine. The EU pumped €30bn (£26bn) into Ukraine in the last year, diverting cash from energy and cohesion funds to respond to the crisis. On Tuesday it pledged a further €50bn in loans and grants, with the UK and the US following suit with a promise of $3bn and $1.3bn respectively in financial supports. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has looked at the financial pledges western countries have made to Ukraine, considering whether it is enough to finance the huge recovery needed to rebuild the war-ravaged country. You can read her analysis here: Japan will host a conference to encourage companies to invest into Ukraine some time between the end of the year and early 2024, foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was quoted by Reuters as saying. Japan was also planning to support Ukraine through projects focused on mine clearance, basic infrastructure such as electricity, agriculture and strengthening democracy, Hayashi told the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia’s new generation of Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads, would soon be deployed for combat duty, Reuters reports. In a speech to new graduates of military academies, Putin stressed the importance of Russia’s “triad” of nuclear forces that can be launched from land, sea or air. “The most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia’s military security and global stability,” he said. “Already about half of the units and formations of the Strategic Missile Forces are equipped with the latest Yars systems, and the troops are being re-equipped with modern missile systems with the Avangard hypersonic warhead.” The first Sarmat launchers would be put on combat duty “in the near future”, the Russian president added. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, meanwhile, has told graduating military academy students that the “collective West” was waging a “real war” against Russia. A UN official said on Wednesday that the mines dislodged by the flood waters from Kakhovka dam in Ukraine could float downstream and reach as far as Black Sea beaches, Reuters reports. Paul Heslop, head of UN Mine Action at the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine, told reporters in Geneva that PMF-1 mines, also known as “butterfly” mines, were light enough to float downstream for a large distance. He said: I would not be surprised to see that those mines have either got down as far as the sea or over the coming months, as the water is continuing to flow, will be transported down there. Unfortunately, we could see anti-personnel pressure mines washing up on beaches around the Black Sea. The collapse of the Russian-held dam on 6 June unleashed floodwaters across southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied areas of the Kherson region, killing more than 50 people and destroying homes and farmland. Poland’s ministry of foreign affairs has tweeted that it has prepared a law enabling the extension of insurance coverage for the transport of goods to and from Ukraine, as well as investment activities. Britain, the US and the EU pledged billions of dollars of extra help to rebuild Ukraine on Wednesday. European Commission chiefs want Hungary to answer urgent questions over claims that Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred there from Russia without the involvement of Kyiv. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, has forged strong political and economic ties with Moscow and said earlier this month that Budapest had received a group of 11 Ukrainian prisoners of war from Russia. Ukraine repatriated three of them on Tuesday and is demanding access to the remainder accusing Orban of a publicity stunt. Hungarian and international media quoted Orban’s chief-of-staff, Gergely Gulyas, as saying the soldiers arrived in Hungary of “their own free will” and that Kyiv was informed after their transfer. “It’s very important that they relevant Hungarian authorities explain to their Ukrainian counterparts. We are seeking asnwers,” said a spokesperson for the European commission. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said battlefield progress in Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces had been “slower than desired”, the BBC reported on Wednesday. “Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It’s not,” it quoted the Ukrainian president as saying in an interview. Ukraine has reported recapturing eight villages in the south in the last two weeks. Though small, the advances are the biggest by its forces since November as they push into heavily fortified and mined Russian-held areas. Rishi Sunak met Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, as well as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister met with the president of the European commission, president of Estonia, prime ministers of Latvia and Ukraine, and the US secretary of state this morning. The prime minister thanked the leaders for attending the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London and for their strong and ongoing support to Ukraine. Reflecting on the work that had already begun in Ukraine to recover and rebuild, the Prime Minister said it is inspiring to see that progress happening at the same time as the armed forces of Ukraine pushed back Russian forces. Discussing the important role of the private sector in the rebuild of Ukraine, the prime minister said it was fantastic to see so many companies and businesses attend the London summit. Officials and business leaders at the Ukraine Recovery Conference should ensure that any “Marshall Plan” for the war-ravaged country includes ensuring children are not separated from their families, Disability Rights International, Hope and Homes for Children, Human Rights Watch and Lumos say. The groups said replacing Ukraine’s institutional care system with modern social services, that strengthen families to help keep them together, should be a key feature to the reconstruction plans. Mark Waddington, CEO of Hope and Homes for Children, said: There’s a hidden humanitarian crisis playing out in Ukraine, where millions of families are displaced, social services are in tatters, unemployment is growing, food prices are rocketing, daily air raids are the norm and trauma from Russian occupation is widespread. As a result, many parents are struggling to cope, and thousands of children are at risk of being placed in harmful institutions. Now, at a time of war, children need loving and comforting families more than ever. The Ukraine Recovery Conference offers an incredible opportunity to talk about physical reconstruction of buildings, roads and infrastructure, but it must also address social reconstruction that directly serves families and children. This must include a commitment to closing every last children’s institution in Ukraine, and creating a modern care system that helps to keep families together. Families are the future of Ukraine, and leaders at the recovery conference must not ignore this. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Ukraine has succeeded in making the EU as united “as it has never been before”, with his country “activating the moral force of Nato”. Ukraine’s president is pushing for Ukraine to join Nato and the EU. Russia’s top investigator has said that more than 30 Ukrainians had been given long jail terms in Russian-held Ukraine for committing what he described as serious crimes such as killing civilians, Reuters reports. The comments were made by Alexander Bastrykin, head of the Investigative Committee, Russia’s equivalent of the FBI in the US. He was reported as saying the courts operating on territory in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian forces had been working hard to jail people who had fought on the Ukrainian side against Russia. “After the liberation of Mariupol and other settlements, many Ukrainian nationalists surrendered. In the course of further work, we began to establish their involvement in crimes against peace and human security, including the killing of civilians,” Bastrykin told Russia’s Tass news agency. He said 90 criminal cases had been sent to courts. “Based on the evidence gathered, courts have already convicted more than 30 defendants, sentencing them to long terms of imprisonment and some to life imprisonment,” Bastrykin added. The alleged war crimes referred to by Bastrykin could not immediately be independently verified. Russia is itself under pressure for alleged war crimes, with the international criminal court having issued an arrest warrant in March against Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. The Kremlin has rejected the allegation as false. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, has set out a new war insurance mechanism to support Ukraine’s recovery, Reuters reports. “I’m announcing today the establishment of an insurance mechanism to cover investments in Ukraine against war-related risks via the French public investment bank,” Colonna said at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London on Wednesday. She added that the French government’s plan was consistent with the insurance mechanism proposed by Britain and Ukraine. The comments come as the UK is introducing new laws that will allow ministers to maintain Russian sanctions until compensation is paid to Ukraine, thus introducing a way for frozen Russian assets to be donated to Ukrainian reconstruction. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged western leaders to help rebuild his war-torn country, as he hailed the reconstruction project as a crucial part of its fight for freedom. The Ukrainian president addressed the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London via video-link on Wednesday, as Rishi Sunak and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated their support for the country. Sunak outlined how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this “help Ukraine unleash its potential”. “It’s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they’ve inflicted. So we’re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets,” the prime minister said at the conference. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said, according to Reuters. Ukrainian forces are “very actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,” President Zelenskiy said in his latest evening address. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. Speaking after Zelenskiy, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she had “no doubt” that Ukraine would join the EU. Addressing the conference, she praised the progress and speed of reform in the country, she said Europe could never match the country’s sacrifice but did stand united behind it. She spoke about a recent visit to Ukraine: I saw a country that does everything possible to rise from the ashes of the war. Everything they are fighting for, and what they are dying for. They show it on the battlefield. They show it on the streets. They show it in the classrooms. They are fighting for their future. Setting out her hopes for the future of Ukraine, Von der Leyen said it would become a “country that attracts foreign investment, a country that is master of its future, a country that is a member of the European Union”. She added: Together we gather here to tell Ukrainians that their dream is also our dream […] Ukrainians tell us, when they imagine their future, they see Europe’s flag flying over their cities. I have no doubt that Ukraine will be part of our union. Zelenskiy ends his speech with an impassioned please to political and business leaders, stressing that the future of Ukraine is also the future of the world. We are building much more than one country. We are building a world, as it will be during the lifetime of our generation and after us. Will it be peaceful? Will it be stable?Will it be democratic? It depends on each and every one of us. After thanking Sunak – who he mentions he has not seen in “quite a while” – and the UK, he ends with “Slava Ukraine”. Zelenskiy moves onto to talking about the importance of Ukraine in strengthening democracy throughout the world. Russia invaded Ukraine, not only to steal our land, resources and people, without Ukraine that can be no Russian plan. […] Russian bosses are very, very afraid of our democracy. Why? Because democracy paves the way for the rule of law [and] getting rid of corruption. Under the key principle of our countries, every person matters. This is very important. And of course, democracy is in the nature of Ukrainians, and we will do it anyway, no matter what they think, or do in Russia. But we all have to realise that the more democracy we have, the greater is the strength in our entire region. The more rule of law we have, the more law will work here on the eastern flank of Europe. The Ukrainian president argues that the war is showing the rest of the world the weaknesses that other countries have to address, from the transformation of energy to modern warfare including the threat of cyber attacks. We are doing all these in Ukraine. We need the experience of our partners in all these. We build security together and thus may convince the world that democracies can be defended. Zelenskiy stresses the huge need for reconstruction in Ukraine. There is currently no place in the world where there is a need to construct and rebuild as many objects as in Ukraine. Every new day of Russian agrression, brings new ruins. Thousands, thousands and thousands of destroyed houses, devastated industries, burned lives. He accuses Russia of committing “the largest crime of ecocide in Europe” by destroying the Nova Kakhovka dam. Zelenskiy says he sees no alternative to the green transformation of the economy, and that the war has proved the extent to which energy is a key security issue. It is green energy that guarantees real energy stability. Ukraine can be and will be one of the key suppliers of clean electricity and green hydrogen to ensure that. The potential of this interest here alone is about $400bn. Zelenskiy says his country is developing strong bilateral alliances with leaders of democratic world, including the U K, the US, Canada, Japan, Australia all the EU members. These alliances provide new power in defence, the economy and global prospects for democracy, he says. He points out that political and economic stability in Ukraine benefits the whole globe, saying that at least 600 million consumers around the world directly depend on Ukraine’s agricultural production. Zelenskiy says that when the country underwent a blockage by Russia, the world was threatened by price rises and social collapse. He says Ukraine has now partially restored movement of agriculture which is bringing stability and economic benefits around the world. Zelenskiy thanks the nations supporting Ukraine and says he hopes the conference will come up with concrete projects. He says Ukraine has succeeded in uniting the European Union like never before, which is reflected in “many political economic sanction and humanitarian decisions”. He adds: Ukraine has activated all the power of solidarity for which the EU was configured. The moral leadership in protecting peace “is only possible with Ukraine”, he says. Moving onto to Nato, he says: We are already defending the common space of freedom in the alliance and are only waiting for the alliance leaders to recognise this [political’] reality.” Zelenskiy says growth and strong investments must be preceded by trust and the plan for Ukraine must be “preceded by confidence that that’s what has been rebuilt will not fall”. He argues that while no one has the power to eradicate evil, it can be overcome. He says the world is watching to see if normal life can be restored in Ukraine. If it is, that will be an “ideological blow” to the aggressor, he adds. And it’s not about bricks, but about life in general. The world is abandoned with ruins reminding us of the wars of the past. And politics in different regions, unfortunately, is abandoned with sick ideas of hate, rage and resentment which point to possible wars in the future. […] No one has the power to cleanse the depths of human nature from the evil that some sometimes rises to the surface and destroys and kills. But given time, and right now, we are able to protect lives and overcome their ruins. […] The eyes of the world are looking at us and at whether we will defeat Russian aggression exactly as freedom deserves to win – that is without compromising our values. Also the world is watching to see if we will restore normal life in such a way that our transformation will land an ideological defeat on the aggressor. We protect Ukraine and thus we protect freedom. And when we build Ukraine we will build freedom, country, region, continent, world. It’s a global task. Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is now addressing the conference. He says: Mr Prime Minister, thank you for your kind words about Ukraine and our soldiers. And thanks for your leadership and the support the UK provides to Ukraine. Thank you that we are really united in defending freedom. Dear leaders of politics, business and public opinion. Dear presidents, prime ministers, ministers, heads of international organisations, and of course, dear journalists, when we are talking about recovery we are talking about millions of jobs, billions in corporate profits and GDP. And not only for Ukraine but for all our countries mine and yours. Countries that want, and will, live freely. Sunak ends his address with a message of hope, telling the story of a Ukrainian soldier. He says: He was stationed in an empty house, not far from the frontline, surrounded by the destruction of war. When he could snatch a moment of free time, he used it to plant seeds. He was trying to create a plot of vegetables, hoping that by the time the homeowners returned, they would have begun to grow. What a profound expression of hope. And, you know, from that house to this hall, we’re doing the same thing. We’re planting the seeds of Ukraine’s future. Today, we can water them and in time the Ukrainian people will harvest them. Sunak goes on to say the business, governments and financial institutions must partner to invest and shore up the country. He says: To make this happen. The British government will continue to play its full part. And I’m proud that today we’re announcing a multi year commitment to support Ukraine’s economy. Over three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3bn we’re also launching a new UK Ukraine tech bridge to foster investment and talent, along with support for green energy and more all part of a vast collective effort from allies and partners around the world, including significant new support from the EU, which is also being announced this week. Financial institutions are playing their part. The IMF is putting $15bn into Ukraine over the next four years as part of a $115bn commitment by the G7 and its partners and institutions like the EBRD providing seed capital to support private sector led growth. Because above all, we must build a platform for business. Only they can truly crowd in the innovation and investment that Ukraine needs. And that’s why we’re launching the Ukraine business compact for the private sector to pledge their support for Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction. And I am delighted to announce today that over 400 businesses from 38 countries with a combined market cap of $4.9tn has now signed up the City of London has a huge amount to offer. And that deepened liquid capital markets and world class finance expertise. So there is no better place to announce today the New London conference framework for war risk insurance. This is a huge step forward towards helping insurers to underwrite the investments into Ukraine, removing one of the biggest barriers and giving investors the confidence they need to act. Sunak outlines how Ukraine must be supported to fast track recovery and support this “help Ukraine unleash its potential”. He says Russia must pay for the violence it has inflicted on the country. Sunak says: It’s clear Russia must pay for the destruction that they’ve inflicted. So we’re working with allies to explore lawful routes to use Russian assets. And on Monday, we publish new legislation to allow us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays up. The UK’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is now speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, saying the conference is “planting the seeds of Ukraine’s future”. We covered the trail of his speech below (see 7.47), but here is some more: Sunak says: Before this terrible war Ukraine’s economy was becoming a huge investment opportunity. It was the breadbasket of Europe, exporting millions of tonnes of food and grain each month. Top five exporter of iron ore and steel, a leader in energy, pushing forward renewables hydrogen and electric vehicles, and the startup nation, which helped spark names like PayPal, WhatsApp and revolute with a thriving tech sector, which actually had a record year in 2022. Because the truth is that opportunity is still there today. In fact, the war has only proved how much Ukraine has to offer. When I visited Kyiv, last November, I saw this for myself. I saw Ukraine’s incredible spirit, a spirit yes of strength and defiance. But also of ingenuity and innovation. In a converted office block, I met tech experts, civilian and military, who were working together to find new ways to bolster the country’s defences. They were networking mobile phones, so that people across Ukraine could download an app, which would allow their phone to pick up the sound of the showerhead drone feedback the location so that Ukrainian air defence could track them and shoot them down during the winter Russia tried to destroy Ukraine’s energy grid. By February over 40% of power generation was down. But now because of that incredible ingenuity and defiance, Ukraine has got the grid back online, and they’re even able to start exporting electricity back to Europe. As we’ve seen in backwards and Mariupol. What Russia cannot take, it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine’s economy. And the scale of the challenge is real. The war brought a 29% Fall in Ukraine’s GDP last year. [more follows] The Ukraine Recovery Conference has started in London this morning. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, is addressing the conference. He says: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. There are over 1,000 public and private sector decision-makers here. Governments representing 61 states, 33 international organisations, over 400 businesses and 130 civil society organisations. After nearly 18 months of Ukraine withstanding the Russian full scale invasion, the international community is coming together today with a shared belief and confidence in Ukraine’s future. Russia’s full scale invasion has caused untold suffering, but Ukraine is rebuilding now. Recovery offers an opportunity not only to repair what was lost, but stride forward and to rebuild an economy that is more modern, more open, greener and more resilient. When I visited Kyiv recently, I could see the construction equipment from JCB already visible everywhere. This you are see is about unlocking Ukraine’s potential, supporting Ukraine’s immediate recovery needs and unlocking a private sector led recovery. After the sacrifices and suffering of the war, Ukrainians are planning for a better future. And it is in the interests of the world, that the country they rebuild should be stronger than ever, integrated into global markets, and self reliant. Ukrainian forces are reinforcing positions they have reached in areas of the southern front line after having “partial success” fighting Russian forces, a military spokesperson said today. Reuters reports: Ukrainian forces are conducting offensive operations in the direction of the Russian-occupied cities of Melitopol and Berdiansk in the Zaporizhzhia region, general staff spokesperson Andriy Kovalev said, listing names of southeastern villages. “They had partial success in the directions of Novodanilivka – Robotyne, Mala Tokmachka – Verbove, Vilne Pole – Makarivka, they are consolidating at the achieved boundaries,” he was quoted as saying by the Ukraine military media centre. Ukraine is also fighting to hold back an advance of Russian troops in the east, with “especially heavy fighting” taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he said. Ukraine said on Monday it had recaptured eight villages in two weeks of counteroffensive operations in the occupied south but that the Kremlin’s forces were trying to regain the initiative in the east by stepping up attacks. The UK Ministry of Defence has issued its update on the situation in Ukraine: Intense fighting continues in sectors of southern Ukraine. However, over recent weeks, Russia has continued to expend significant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea. This includes an extensive zone of defences of 9 km in length, 3.5 km north of the town Armyansk, on the narrow bridge of land connecting Crimea to the Kherson region. These elaborate defences highlight the Russian command’s assessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea. Russia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack on the Moscow region, and that three drones had been shot down. The UK has backed $3bn of World Bank loan guarantees to shore up Ukraine’s economic stability, the government announced today. In what the government is calling the support “the first bilateral package of multi-year fiscal assistance to be set out by a G7 country”. At a two-day Ukraine recovery conference in London today, Sunak will outline a package which will also include £240m ($306m) of bilateral assistance and an expansion of British International Investment in Ukraine. The UK’s support is backed by the Ukraine Business Compact which consists of more than 400 companies from 38 countries, with a combined annual revenue of over $1.6tn, who today pledge to back Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction. Virgin, Sanofi, Philips, Hyundai Engineering and Citi are among the companies involved. The compact will, according to the government, trade, investment, peer-to-peer expertise sharing and responsible business practice in Ukraine, ensuring it can rebuild as a resilient, agile and prosperous economy. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: As we’ve seen in Bakhmut and Mariupol, what Russia cannot take it will seek to destroy. They want to do the same to Ukraine’s economy. The scale of the challenge is real, the war brought a 29% fall in Ukraine’s GDP last year, but just look at the streets of Kyiv, despite the threat of attack, people are getting on with their lives – and getting on with business. […] I’m proud that today we’re announcing a multiyear commitment to support Ukraine’s economy, and over the next three years, we will provide loan guarantees worth $3 billion. President of the World Bank Group, Ajay Banga, said: The UK government’s generous guarantees to the World Bank Group will support the people of Ukraine at a critical moment. The World Bank Group is designed to do hard things like helping people rebuild their lives after devastation. With this support, we will keep delivering on that mission and help Ukrainians imagine a life after the war. After more than a year of war in Ukraine, the package is designed to encourage the private sector to use its resources to help speed Ukraine’s reconstruction. To deal with the issue of insurance against war damage and destruction, the prime minister will also launch a framework a range of measures designed to “de-risk” Ukraine to increase investor confidence, including providing guarantees and insurance for reconstruction projects now while the conflict is ongoing through the Multilateral Investment Guarantees Agency. He will also launch the London Conference Framework for War Risk Insurance at the summit and that some major companies had already signed up to the Ukraine Business Compact, a statement of support for Ukraine’s recovery. In addition Sunak is announcing up to £250m of new capital for the UK’s Development Finance Institution - British International Investment (BII) – to support infrastructure projects, energy markets, financial services and agriculture. Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukrainian official said Ukraine is seeking up to $40bn to fund the first part of a “Green Marshall Plan” to rebuild its economy, including developing a coal-free steel industry. The total reconstruction bill is likely to be huge, with Ukraine, the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations estimating in March that the cost was at $411bn for the first year of the war. It could easily reach more than $1tn. Ukrainian forces are gaining some ground towards Melitopol and Berdiansk in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Andriy Kovalev, a spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, has said according to Reuters. “They had partial success, they are gaining ground,” Kovalev was quoted as saying in a post on the Ukraine Military Media Center’s Telegram channel, adding that the gains were near the settlements of Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, among others. Ukraine continues to hold back the advance of Russian troops in the east of the country, with “especially heavy fighting” taking place along near Lyman in the Donetsk region, he added. “Intense fighting” is continuing in southern Ukraine, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says in its latest update on the conflict. It reports that Russia has recently spent “significant effort building defensive lines deep in rear areas, especially on the approaches to occupied Crimea”, highlighting Moscow’s “assessment that Ukrainian forces are capable of directly assaulting Crimea”. “Russia continues to see maintaining control of the peninsula as a top political priority,” it says. Back to the drones reportedly intercepted in Russia. The country’s Tass news agency has reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, that another drone was shot down near Lukino village in Moscow region, according to Reuters. Tass also reported two of the drones were intercepted on their way to the Taman Division of Russia’s Ground Forces. The division is based in Kalininets, some 60km (37 miles) from the Kremlin. Reuters could not independently verify the reports. It was not immediately known who launched the drones. In May, drones struck wealthy districts of Moscow, in what Russia said was a Ukrainian attack and one politician called the most dangerous attack on the capital since World War Two. Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. More from the ISW analysis, which reports that the Belarusian General Staff has confirmed that Belarus has amended the language of its constitution to renounce its neutrality and non-nuclear status. Deputy Head of the Faculty of the Belarusian General Staff Colonel Andrey Bogodel stated on June 20 that in order to respond to “external challenges and threats,” Belarus has made requisite changes to its constitution renouncing its neutrality and removing the wording on its non-nuclear status. The move comes after Russian president Vladimir Putin last week said the first tactical nuclear weapons to be stationed in Belarus had arrived. Responding to the announcement, US president Joe Biden said the threat that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons was “real”. The Institute for the Study of War highlights Russia’s efforts to expand its military recruitment pool in its latest assessment, noting that it has lowered its eligibility requirements once again. It points to a report by Tass newswire which says that the Duma on Tuesday adopted the third and final reading of a law which will allow citizens with criminal records and those deemed “partially fit” for military service to sign contracts with the military during wartime. The Russian Ministry of Defence has already recruited about 15,000 prisoners since February, according to the Russian human rights organisation Rus Sidyashchaya, the ISW writes. The wires have sent through a series of images from the Without Limits clinic in Kyiv, which helps people learn to walk again using prosthetic limbs. The clinic says it has seen a massive increase in demand since the Russian invasion began in February 2022 and estimates 80% of its patients are former soldiers. Two drones have been intercepted on their approach to military warehouses in the Moscow region, Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the area, has said according to Reuters. “Debris was found, no damage or casualties,” Vorobyov said, adding that the drones fell near the village of Kalininets. Russia’s channels on the Telegram messaging app, including one with links to the security services, said at least one more drone was intercepted near the village of Lukino. Ukrainian forces are “very actively destroying the enemy, physically clearing Ukraine,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address. “Protection against terror means the destruction of terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the evil state will never again have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine,” he continued. Ukraine is now more than two weeks into its counteroffensive and has made small advances. General Oleksander Syrskyi, Ukraine’s commander of land forces, said on Telegram on Tuesday that his troops were making progress on the flanks of the shattered eastern city of Bakhmut, which fell to Russian mercenaries last month after months of fighting, Reuters reported. Ukrainian troops, he said, were repelling increasingly intense Russian attacks near Kupiansk in the northeast. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces in the south were “gradually, in small steps, but very confidently, making advances. We could even use the allegory that we are carving up every metre of land from the enemy.” Leaders and representatives from more than 60 countries are expected in London from Wednesday for a two-day conference to secure funding to help Ukraine recover from the ravages of war. The EU will provide Ukraine with $54.58bn in aid for 2024-27, the bloc’s president, Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of the summit, while the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is set to unveil a major package, including $3bn of additional guarantees to unlock World Bank lending, according to his office. More from AFP: The International Ukraine Recovery Conference 2023, hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is the second to be held since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February last year. The first, in Lugano, Switzerland, in July last year saw Kyiv’s allies commit to supporting Ukraine through what is expected to be an eye-wateringly expensive and decades-long recovery. Ukraine‘s Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told them rebuilding could cost at least $750 billion. The World Bank has since put an estimate of $14 billion on Ukraine‘s immediate needs for repairing the damage caused by the bitter fighting. But a recent study by the World Bank, the UN, the European Union and the Ukrainian government said the wider recovery of the economy would cost $441 billion. Whatever the final amount, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has likened it to the amount of money needed for the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. Ukrainian forces in the south and east are “actively destroying the enemy”, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest evening address, more than two weeks into Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Ahead of a major conference in London at which the UK and EU are set to pledge billions of dollars in aid for the rebuilding of Ukraine, Zelenskiy also assured his international partners that “Ukraine uses every weapon and every shell as efficiently as possible and always to protect lives”. He said Ukraine’s recovery “will become not only construction projects, but also a global project of protection”. “A rebuilt Ukraine, a transformed Ukraine, a strengthened Ukraine is a carrier of security and a guarantor of security, it is protection against any form of Russian terror and protection against any repetition of Russian aggression,” he said. In other developments: Ahead of the conference, a senior Ukraine official said the country would struggle to absorb the expected billions of western private and public sector aid for its recovery not due to corruption, but a simple lack of capacity to process and invest such huge sums. “Historically the largest amount of money we have been capable of working with was $6bn a year in 2014,” said Mustafa Nayyem, the head of the Ukraine State Agency for Restoration and Infrastructure Development. Russia has threatened strikes on Kyiv’s “decision-making centres” if Ukraine uses western-supplied missiles against the occupied peninsula of Crimea. Sergei Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, said the potential use of US-supplied Himars and UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles against targets in Crimea would mark the west’s “full involvement in the conflict and would entail immediate strikes upon decision-making centres in Ukrainian territory”. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief has accused Russia of “mining” the cooling pond used to keep the reactors cool at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine’s south. “Most terrifying is that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was additionally mined during that time … namely the cooling pond was mined,” Kyrylo Budanov, head of the GUR agency, said on television, without providing evidence. The Pentagon says that it overestimated the value of the weapons it has sent to Ukraine by $6.2bn over the past two years – about double early estimates – resulting in a surplus that will be used for future security packages. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said a detailed review of the accounting found an error of $3.6bn in the current fiscal year and $2.6bn in the 2022 fiscal year, which ended on 30 September. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for an acceleration of Black Sea grain shipments from Ukrainian ports under a deal allowing safe wartime exports, a UN spokesperson said as Russia threatens to quit the pact which is due for renewal on 17 July. Guterres was disappointed by a slowing pace of ship inspections, spokesperson Farhan Haq said, and the exclusion of Pivdennyi (Yuzhny) port – one of three Ukrainian ports covered by the Black Sea export deal. Kyiv has repatriated three Ukrainian prisoners of war from Hungary where they were transferred from Russia without coordination with Kyiv, said Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesperson Oleg Nikolenko, who had previously accused Hunary of ignoring Kyiv’s requests for access to the PoWs. Ukrainian diplomats and other relevant Ukrainian authorities were working to try to bring back the remaining prisoners of war, Nikolenko said. Prosecutors said they had served a notice of suspicion to Kyiv’s head of municipal security after three people died in a Russian air attack when they were unable to get into a bomb shelter. The deaths on 1 June caused public outrage and prompted the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to vow a harsh response. The destruction of the vast Kakhovka hydroelectric dam has caused €1.2bn euros of damage, the Ukrainian environment minister Ruslan Strilets has told his EU counterparts. He also warned that mines unearthed by flooding could wash on to other European countries’ shores and that “there are things that we can never restore. These are the ecosystems that were washed away into the Black Sea.” The Ukrainian kickboxing champion Maksym Bordus has been killed fighting Russian forces, according to a website that lists athletes killed in the war. Bordus was killed on 11 June in “fierce fighting against Russian invaders”, according to Sport Angels, a Ukrainian website set up with the assistance of the Sports Committee, which brings together NGOs and federations from non-Olympic sports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T13:59:04Z","webTitle":"Hunt’s modest environmental goals show party is out of tune with voters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","fields":{"bodyText":"Ramping up energy efficiency is a no-brainer when it comes to cutting energy bills, ensuring security of supply and reducing climate-heating emissions. In Jeremy Hunt, the Conservatives appear to have found a brain. In the autumn statement, he pledged to double annual energy efficiency investment with new funding of £6bn. That is the good news. The bad news is that doubling does not happen until 2025, when the energy bills crisis may be over and the climate crisis will be even worse. Hunt is the fourth chancellor of 2022 and the chaos in the Tory party has meant unnecessary delays in making people’s homes warmer and cheaper to heat. The trouble goes back almost a decade in fact, when David Cameron’s ditching of “green crap” saw insulation rates fall by 95%, a decision that has cost bill payers billions. Details of the new efficiency plans are yet to be published but will include a new “energy efficiency taskforce”. Its goal will be to reduce the UK’s energy use in buildings and industry by 15% by 2030, a fairly modest ambition. On the supply of low-carbon energy, Hunt backed expensive nuclear power as well as offshore wind, but said nothing on the fastest and by far the cheapest sources: onshore wind and solar. With blocks on the latter, the Tories continue to be wildly out of tune with voters. Hunt increased the windfall tax on soaring oil and gas profits from 25% to 35%, making the total tax rate 75%. That may look high, but remember that the oil and gas belongs to the nation – you and me – not the fossil fuel companies, and other nations like Norway have higher rates. A windfall tax on electricity producers of 45%, including wind, solar and nuclear, was also announced by Hunt. Depending on how that is implemented, the green energy companies could end up being taxed more than the fossil fuel producers. That would be mad when green energy is the solution to the energy and climate crisis, and while oil and gas firms can get 91% tax rebates by investing in more oil and gas. Electric car sales are in the fast lane and Hunt announced that from 2025, owners will need to start paying vehicle excise duty, sometimes misleadingly referred to as “road tax”. That is a disincentive to go electric but by that date electric cars will not only be cheaper to run, as they already are, but also very probably cheaper to buy than petrol or diesel models. On the climate crisis, Hunt said: “With the existential vulnerability we face, now would be the wrong time to step back from our international climate responsibilities. So I can confirm that, despite the economic pressures, we remain fully committed to the historic Glasgow climate pact agreed at Cop26, including a 68% reduction in our own emissions by 2030.” The government is not currently on track to meet this target. The autumn statement’s purpose was to find £55bn in tax rises and spending cuts to stabilise the UK economy. To put that in context, that’s about 18 days’ worth of the pure profit the global oil and gas industry has been banking for the past 50 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-13T15:36:32Z","webTitle":"What is nuclear fusion and what have scientists achieved?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/13/what-is-nuclear-fusion-what-have-scientists-achieved-ignition","fields":{"bodyText":"Physicists are a-buzz over new results from nuclear fusion experiments. But what have they found, and how big a breakthrough is it? What is nuclear fusion? We experience nuclear fusion every day – it is the process that gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars. In brief, it involves light atoms being smashed together to produce heavier ones, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. To do this ourselves takes some serious engineering. At the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a weak laser beam is split and the energy amplified to give 192 laser beams. These are used to heat the walls of a small gold can, called a hohlraum, to more than 3m degrees Celsius, resulting in the emission of X-rays. These X-rays heat a millimetre-sized capsule within the hohlraum that contains two forms of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. The heat causes the surface of the capsule to explode outwards, forcing its contents to implode – in other words, the deuterium and tritium are forced together rapidly at very high pressure and temperature. The upshot is that, in the hottest part of the fuel, fusion occurs, resulting in the formation of helium nuclei. As one helium nucleus has slightly less mass than the combination of one deuterium and one tritium nucleus, the difference in mass is released as a burst of energy. In the right conditions the helium nuclei produced in this process can transfer their kinetic energy to the remaining fuel, heating it up and triggering yet more fusion. Should this happen, it becomes possible to release more energy than was put into the experiment by the lasers, a condition known as ignition. What just happened? Researchers at the NIF have announced that, for the first time, they have managed to do just that. The team used 2.05MJ of energy to heat the fuel with lasers, releasing 3.15MJ of energy. Is that a lot of energy? No, not really. The difference – 1.1MJ – is about 0.3kWh. It takes about 0.2kWh to boil a full kettle of water. Why is everyone so excited? Nuclear fusion research has been going on for 70 years and this is the first time scientists have managed to demonstrate ignition – a positive energy gain. The results show that it is indeed possible to use laser fusion to generate energy – a crucial proof of principle that will spur on research to develop the technology. That matters because it is hoped nuclear fusion will eventually provide a near-limitless, safe and clean source of energy. How far away are we from powering our homes via nuclear fusion? Miles. And miles. Only a small amount of excess energy was generated in the latest experiments – and it took a lot of energy, around 500MJ, to power the lasers in the first place. Such reactions would also need to happen at a much greater frequency – about 10 times a second – and be far cheaper to run before nuclear fusion could actually be used to power even a kettle. Jeremy Chittenden, a professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: “Anyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor. “The experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T19:17:33Z","webTitle":"Putin says Russia will halt participation in New Start nuclear arms treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty","fields":{"bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has said Russia will halt its participation in New Start, the last major remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the US, in a speech devoted to the one-year anniversary of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” the Russian president said during a speech characterised by grievances against the west. “In this regard, I am forced to state that Russia is suspending its participation in the strategic offensive arms treaty.” The full implications of Putin’s threat were not immediately clear. Russia has already suspended mutual inspections of nuclear weapons sites and participation in a bilateral consultative commission. Experts said that if Putin now went further and stopped routine reporting and data exchange on nuclear weapon movements and other related developments, it would be a serious blow. “The announcement by Russia that it’s suspending participation in New Start is deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters on a visit to Athens. “We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does. We’ll of course make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.” The 2010 New Start treaty provides for limits on the deployed strategic nuclear arsenals of the world’s two largest nuclear powers, capping strategic nuclear assets at 1,550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed missiles and heavy bombers. The treaty also provides for joint monitoring of each side’s deployed nuclear arsenals, as well as coordination through the bilateral consultative commission. Later, the Russian foreign ministry announced that Moscow would continue to abide by the limits set by the treaty and would also continue to exchange information with the US on planned launches of intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles under the 1988 Ballistic Missile Launch Notification Agreement. Those decisions were taken in order to “maintain a sufficient degree of predictability and stability in the nuclear missile sphere”, the ministry said in a statement. US officials said the Biden administration had feared Putin might decide to withdraw Russia from the treaty altogether and no longer recognise the agreed limits on the nuclear arsenal. The Russian foreign ministry had summoned the new US ambassador to Moscow, Lynne Tracy, for a meeting on Tuesday, saying it had an important announcement, prompting speculation of a full withdrawal. Instead, they said, very little had changed as a result of Putin’s announcement formalising the status quo. “This is a big deal; suspension of the treaty is not equal to withdrawal but in reality, it could become really close over time,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior researcher in the weapons of mass destruction and other strategic weapons programme at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research. In a nearly two-hour speech, Putin said the treaty could not be kept separate from the war in Ukraine and “other hostile actions of the west against our country”. He said: “Now, through Nato representatives, they are putting forward, in fact, an ultimatum: you, Russia, must fulfil everything that you have agreed on, including the Start treaty, and we will behave as we please.” In particular, Putin fumed over Nato support for Ukraine, and claimed the west was seeking a “strategic defeat” of Russia. He also claimed the US was seeking to rewrite the post-second world war security architecture, “to build an American-style world where there is only one master”. Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of the R Politik analysis firm, said of the speech: “It feels more doomed, much more irreconcilable. Almost like it is either them or us, even if he does not say it.” The decision to suspend participation in the arms treaty would mark a new low in US-Russia relations and arms control, one of the few topics on which Moscow and Washington DC could find common ground. “Details matter, but if Russia is indeed stopping data exchanges and notifications, it would fundamentally change the nuclear relationship with Russia. [The US and Russia] have had some form of strategic arms control in place since 1972,” wrote Jon Wolfsthal, who served as a senior adviser to Barack Obama for arms control and nonproliferation at the national security council. “[The] US still has extensive ability to monitor Russian nuclear forces, even without a treaty in place. But the loss of agreements will increase uncertainty and chances of misunderstanding, inflate threat perception and fuel accelerating arms race,” he tweeted. Putin, in his speech, promised tax breaks for businesses and government support for fighters returning from the war in Ukraine. Much of the speech was extremely conservative given the stress put on Russian society by the country’s first mass mobilisation since the second world war. He said Russia would resume testing of nuclear weapons if the US did the same, a serious escalation that could mean it was preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Withdrawing from New Start would theoretically allow Russia to end compliance with limits of deployed nuclear weapons and would stop meetings of the bilateral consultative commission, the implementing body of the treaty. When the treaty was extended in 2021, the then Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said the US “cannot afford to lose New Start’s intrusive inspection and notification tools”. Those notifications include information on the numbers, locations and technical characteristics of weapons systems and facilities. “Failing to swiftly extend New Start would weaken America’s understanding of Russia’s long-range nuclear forces,” Kirby said then. Baklitskiy said: “Russia will probably stick to the New Start treaty limits, at least for now, but it will be harder for the US to verify compliance only using the national technical means. And I would expect the US also suspending its obligations.” “One silver lining is that Russian decision is political and can be easily reversed if the overall political relations change,” he added. “Also, since the treaty exists, getting back to implementation would be straightforward. The problem, of course, is that there is no change of political relations in sight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"games/2023/aug/17/twitch-blocking-powers-online-abuse","type":"article","sectionId":"games","sectionName":"Games","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T18:35:01Z","webTitle":"Twitch to provide new blocking powers to combat online abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/aug/17/twitch-blocking-powers-online-abuse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/games/2023/aug/17/twitch-blocking-powers-online-abuse","fields":{"bodyText":"The live video streaming company Twitch will allow users to prevent blocked or banned users from viewing their streams, in a move designed to counter harassment on the platform. The popular streaming service, mostly used to watch others playing video games, will launch the new feature in September. At present, streamers can block users from their chats but this update will mean that they can also completely hide their streams from those who have been blocked by them directly or by the tech company’s moderators. The Amazon-owned platform is also examining the option of adopting bans on specific IP addresses, to prevent harassers from making new accounts. Harassment is a longstanding problem on the platform, which launched in 2011, and the new safety features are highly anticipated and have been frequently requested by streamers. Women on the platform have come forward with stories of harassment and abuse from men in the Twitch streaming community. The app has also had issues with “hate raids” – where loyal fanbases of streamers attack other streamers and fill their comments with hate. In May, a study into online gaming showed half of British female gamers had suffered abuse online, rising to 75% among those aged 18-24. One in 10 respondents said they were left feeling suicidal, and 25% of women said such messages made them depressed. Twitch has previously introduced tools to detect when people make new accounts to circumvent channel bans. It has also shared ban lists between streamers so there is more transparency. Trevor Fisher, Twitch’s senior product manager, said: “We’ve gotten a lot of feedback, over the years, that people want their channel bans to do more and we know that this is an area that people want us to do more on. “If you ban somebody and they’re currently watching then the stream, playback will be interrupted for them, so that they immediately lose the ability to view the stream. Then, if you go offline then stream again, they won’t be able to watch your subsequent streams either until you choose to unban them.” Rachel Delphin, the chief marketing officer of Twitch, said on Variety’s Strictly Business podcast: “They’re cultivating the kind of community that they want on top of the rules that we have already established and enforce.” A Twitch spokesperson said: “Twitch exists to help people find community and share their passions, neither of which can happen if people don’t feel safe. Our Blocked Playback feature is a direct result of invaluable feedback from our community, and will give streamers and their channel moderators more control over who can view their channels. If you ban or block someone, they won’t be able to view your livestream. “Combating hateful conduct and harassment is a core priority and we’ll continue to evolve our safety policies and tooling alongside our community.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The decision comes more than two years after the government approved the release of the water, which will be treated to remove most radioactive materials but will still contain tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials insist the “treated” water will not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment, but the plans face opposition from fishermen who say it risks destroying their livelihoods, almost 12 years after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier. The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned – a process expected to take 30 to 40 years. Japan’s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted. The plan’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology – known as Alps – can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had “grave concerns” about the proposed release. Writing in the Guardian, the forum’s secretary general, Henry Puna, said Japan “should hold off on any such release until we are certain about the implications of this proposal on the environment and on human health, especially recognising that the majority of our Pacific peoples are coastal peoples, and that the ocean continues to be an integral part of their subsistence living”. The South Korean government, which has yet to lift its ban on Fukushima seafood, has said that releasing the water would pose a “grave threat” to marine life. Fishing unions in the area oppose the release, warning it would cause alarm among consumers and derail more than a decade of efforts to reassure the public that Fukushima seafood is safe to eat. Under the plan approved by Japan’s cabinet on Friday, fishermen who fear that the release will impact their livelihoods will be able to access a new ¥50bn ($385m) fund, the Kyodo news agency said. “We would like to thoroughly explain these measures to fishing communities and other relevant parties while listening to their concerns,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said at the meeting, according to Kyodo. The liquid, which Japanese officials claim is “treated” rather than “contaminated”, comprises water used to cool the damaged reactors, and rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Kyodo said the IAEA had conducted several safety reviews of the plan and would issue a report based on its findings, as well as providing support before, during and after the discharge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T05:52:02Z","webTitle":"As G7 leaders start to arrive, Japan PM prepares push in Hiroshima for nuclear weapons pledge","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/18/as-g7-leaders-start-to-arrive-japan-pm-prepares-push-in-hiroshima-for-nuclear-weapons-pledge","fields":{"bodyText":"The war in Ukraine and Chinese aggression towards Taiwan will dominate G7 discussions this week, but host Fumio Kishida is expected to carve out time to push for a pledge on nuclear weapons when leaders meet in Hiroshima, the first place on Earth targeted by an atomic bomb. The leaders began to arrive on Thursday, ahead of an expected visit on Saturday to the city’s Peace Memorial Museum, which contains exhibits showing the scale of the tragedy that unfolded after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on the morning of 6 August 1945, killing 140,000 people by the end of the year. Kishida, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak and other G7 leaders are expected to see displays including a simulation that reproduces the wave of destruction that followed the bombing, with the human cost represented by the mundane – ripped school uniforms, the blackened contents of a bento lunchbox, a tricycle whose three-year-old owner would die within 24 hours. The need to reference the dangers of nuclear weapons has intensified since Barack Obama became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima in 2016. Vladimir Putin has refused to publicly rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, while North Korea continues to develop more sophisticated missiles theoretically capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US mainland. Kishida’s decision to select Hiroshima – where he has a constituency – to host the summit comes with a heavy dose of symbolism, whose most striking physical presence, the A-bomb dome, will be within sight of the leaders when they lay flowers at a cenotaph to the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the A-bombing almost eight decades ago. In the run-up to the summit, Kishida spoke of his desire for “a world without nuclear weapons”, although campaigners point to the failure by Japan – part of the US nuclear umbrella – to sign a 2021 UN treaty banning the possession and use of nuclear weapons. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said of the planned group visit to the peace museum. Pressure is building for a reference to nuclear weapons, with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, this week calling on the G7 leaders to declare they will not use nuclear weapons “in any circumstances”. “This is the moment in which we must insist on the need of revitalising disarmament, and especially nuclear disarmament,” Guterres told Japanese media ahead of his visit to Hiroshima. Ageing hibakusha – survivors of the Hiroshima attack – say the summit is their final chance to make the case for disarmament directly to the US, France and Britain, the group’s three nuclear powers. Some are expected to meet the G7 leaders. “I want to see the leaders commit to getting rid of nuclear weapons,” Shigeaki Mori, an 86-year-old survivor, said. “I also know it’s very hard to get them to go that far.” Kishida wants to use the summit to press his guests to commit to transparency on stockpiles and arsenal reductions. But amid heightened tensions centring on Russia, North Korea and China – all nuclear powers – expectations for a breakthrough are low. US officials have said that Washington will not be pushing an independent agenda on nuclear weapons in Hiroshima, while senior German government sources said nuclear disarmament was not a high priority, adding that it was “important mainly for Japan”. There is unlikely to be more unity on how to respond to China’s growing military and economic clout, with an adviser to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, insisting that the G7 “is not an anti-Chinese G7”. But the group will be under pressure to address Beijing’s escalating threats against Taiwan and the west’s economic and supply chain dependency on China, while ensuring they do not alienate a powerful and important trading partner. “[The G7] have to address economic security and how to deal with sensitive technologies,” said Narushige Michishita, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. “Everything is part of the great power competition that is taking place between the United States and Russia, and the United States and China.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-22T06:37:14Z","webTitle":"Missing Titan sub likely intact but out of power, says expert who designed deepest-diving submersible","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/22/missing-titan-sub-likely-intact-no-power-engineer-ron-allum-titanic-submersible","fields":{"bodyText":"The missing Titan submersible is unlikely to have suffered a catastrophic failure of its pressure hull, according to a deep-sea engineer who designed the vessel that film-maker James Cameron used to reach Earth’s deepest point. Ron Allum, an Australian deep-sea engineer and explorer, co-designed the Deepsea Challenger submersible that Cameron used in 2012 to reach the deepest-known point of Earth’s seabed in the Mariana Trench. Allum also worked with Cameron on his Last Mysteries of the Titanic documentary in 2005. “Sound travels particularly well underwater,” Allum said. “A catastrophic implosion could be heard for thousands of miles and could be recorded.” An implosion would likely trigger signals in military hydrophones, devices used for recording or listening to underwater sounds. “To me, it sounds like the sub’s pressure hull is intact, but it’s demobilised from power,” Allum said. In such an event, the Titan was likely to have automatically dropped weights to resurface. The tourist sub lost communications in the north Atlantic on Sunday while on a dive to the wreck of the Titanic. How long it would take to retrieve it if found depends on where and what state the vessel is in. “If the pressure hull is flooded, you’re now talking about the dry mass of a vessel. You could be lifting a very heavy weight,” Allum said. “If it were intact, an ROV [remotely operated vehicle] could attach to it and it could at least bring it up to shallower water where they could get a stronger lift cable to it to lift it out of the water … that ascent may take an hour or two. “The ROV may have to work around the wreckage … it may take a few hours to release the sub from the seafloor.” The submersible should have released its drop weights in an emergency but partial flooding of the pressure hull could be preventing the vessel from resurfacing, Allum said. “If you have water in the pressure hull, it’s quite a large volume. The drop weights usually aren’t that big, and that could be what’s keeping it on the bottom. “It also means that if the occupants are sitting in a half-flooded pressure hull, that could also be catastrophic. They could become hypothermic. I don’t know how well the CO2 scrubber systems would work if they’re wet.” Dr Glenn Singleman, an Australian extreme medicine expert who has visited the Titanic shipwreck, said a lack of oxygen and carbon dioxide buildup were worrying concerns for the people onboard the missing submersible. “You’ve got to control your oxygen flow and you’ve got to remove carbon dioxide and you’ve got to remove water vapour. They’re the three things about the environment internally that you’ve got to control. The fourth thing is temperature … the water temperature down there is 0 to 1C,” he said. Singleman has been the expedition physician on several deep-sea exploration projects, including for Cameron’s Titanic documentary, the Deepsea Challenger expedition, and Victor Vescovo’s Five Deeps expedition. To prevent carbon dioxide buildup, submersibles are equipped with “scrubbers”, usually made of soda lime, which remove CO2 from the air. “The problem is that you get to a saturation point after a while, and you’ve got to change out the soda lime,” Singleman said. “CO2 content in air is about 400 parts per million. As it goes up, over 1,000[ppm], most people start to get symptomatic, and over 5,000, you’re very symptomatic – you get hyperventilation, you get a headache, you just feel awful.” Singleman added that the oxygen being supplied inside the vessel was likely being delivered to maintain the regular atmospheric concentration of 21% oxygen. A drop in oxygen levels in the air can result in hypoxia, in which bodily tissues become deprived of adequate supply. Oxygen concentrations of 10% and lower can result in loss of consciousness and death. Singleman said the Titan’s initial 96-hour supply of oxygen would be a figure based on an average person’s oxygen consumption at an average metabolic rate. “You’ve got no idea how people respond to the stress of a difficult situation – some people can increase their metabolic rate with stress, some people can relax and try to sleep and decrease it.” Singleman described Paul-Henri Nargeolet, one of the five people on board, as a “legend” in the submersible community and “one of the leading experts” on the Titanic wreck. “His passion is the Titanic, and he’s visited that wreck more than 100 times in submersibles … Everybody says: why would you go on such a risky venture? The reason is because it’s his passion. This is who he is. He’s spent a lifetime in submersibles going to these extreme environments, exploring unknown places and bringing back these incredible photographs and incredible stories of what’s possible. “I’ve talked to PH many times about it. That’s worth the risk.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/sep/03/the-abuse-of-power-confronting-injustice-in-public-life-by-theresa-may-review-blind-to-her-own-failings","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-03T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"The Abuse of Power: Confronting Injustice in Public Life by Theresa May review – blind to her own failings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/sep/03/the-abuse-of-power-confronting-injustice-in-public-life-by-theresa-may-review-blind-to-her-own-failings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/sep/03/the-abuse-of-power-confronting-injustice-in-public-life-by-theresa-may-review-blind-to-her-own-failings","fields":{"bodyText":"It is four years and counting since Theresa May made her teary exit from No 10. That is sufficient time to dab her eyes, reflect on her life and write a memoir, but this is not one. Perhaps the wounds of a miserable prime ministership are still weeping too painfully to address her period in power at length. In the introduction, she says this book “is not an attempt to justify certain decisions I made in office”, though we will later discover that this is not wholly true. Her central theme is how power is abused by public institutions and those who control them. This ought to be a compelling subject, given how many grotesque and flagrant examples we have witnessed over recent years. It is impossible to quarrel with her contention that “lives have been damaged and sometimes destroyed” by bad actors and negligent ones. She is far from the first to note that the reflex instinct of many institutions is to close ranks and try to cover up rotten decision-making in order to protect the reputations of organisations and those who run them. This may not be an original observation, but it has extra heft when it comes from someone who was home secretary for six years and prime minister for three. Examples she explores include the unlawful killing of the 97 football fans who died as a result of a crush in the stands at Sheffield’s Hillsborough football stadium; the inferno at Grenfell Tower that took 72 lives, shattered a community and shocked the nation; child sexual abuse in Rotherham; and bullying and sexual predation at Westminster. There are many more cases that would have merited inclusion, among them the Post Office scandal involving the wrongful prosecutions of hundreds of post office operators falsely accused of fraud, leading to imprisonments of the innocent, sackings, bankruptcies, ill-health and suicides. May’s prose is plain – she is no more gifted as a wordsmith than she is sparkling as an orator – but she can be punchy. “South Yorkshire police created a web of obfuscation and lies to lay the blame on fans,” she writes of the way in which Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough were smeared in an attempt to divert blame for that disaster away from policing failures by falsely assigning culpability for their deaths to the football fans themselves. There was a concerted and mendacious effort to traduce the fans as drunken hooligans by “police, the media and some politicians”. That’s true without being as accurate as it might be. May is not always as hard-hitting as she could be when her own party and its allies are complicit in the abuse. She should have written (my additions in italics) that the smear campaign was conducted by “police, the rightwing media and some Conservative politicians”. After a very long wait, those bereaved by the Hillsborough disaster finally received a full admission by the state of who was truly to blame and an apology in parliament as a result of an inquiry originally set up under New Labour when Alan Johnson was home secretary. May seeks credit for herself – this comes over as rather needy – for deciding to let the Hillsborough independent panel continue when she took over at the Home Office. That scandal occurred long before she was anywhere near government so she finds it easy to use it to present herself as an enemy of injustice and a champion of its victims. The acid test of this book is how she addresses the Windrush scandal, one of the most despicable abuses of state power because people who had been living in and contributing to the UK for decades were suddenly and entirely wrongly told that they had no right to be here. This scandal very much occurred on her watch. It was unfolding during her time as home secretary and seized national attention when she was at No 10. By any measure, the disgusting maltreatment of the Windrush generation was a vicious assault by the state on the rights of citizens that inflicted terrible harm on them. But when she’s personally at the heart of the matter, May becomes much less enthusiastic about lacerating the blunders of the powerful. There’s a rather grudging admission that her use of the phrase “hostile environment” was “in retrospect, not a good term to use”. She presents the Windrush scandal less as the absolute outrage that it was and more as a kind of accident waiting to happen. She spreads the burden of guilt across “the failure of successive governments”, going all the way back to that of Clement Attlee in the late 1940s, to ensure that the Windrush generation “possessed evidence of their right to be in the UK”. She makes a point of saying that there were “27 different home secretaries” between 1948 and 2017, insinuating that she was unlucky that this scandal blew up when she was in charge. It is convenient for her to point an accusing finger at the “inbuilt cynicism” and “overzealous” approach of Home Office officials. She tells us that she was astonished to learn that officials were demanding that members of the Windrush generation produce “four pieces of documentary evidence for each year they had been in the UK” to prove their entitlement to live here. Who had responsibility for the standards and the ethos of the Home Office for half a dozen years? Who presided over a culture of institutional ignorance and arrogance towards the Windrush generation? Who was the home secretary when the department received warnings that many of them were being wrongly treated as illegal immigrants? Who had failed to foresee and avoid a scandal that the inquiry into it concluded was “foreseeable and avoidable”? The answer stares May in the mirror. She can’t authentically present herself as the righteous scourge of injustice when she flinches from properly confronting her role in one of the ugliest abuses of power to stain recent British history. That’s not the only lacuna in this book. It tells us almost nothing that is not already known, either about the subjects that she addresses or about the author. “I’m pretty sure at one stage my mother wanted me to become a nun” is as tasty as it gets in terms of personal revelation. May says that being a vicar’s daughter taught her to be “very careful with what I say”. Discretion can sometimes be an asset in politics, but it is an awful letdown when the reader has been promised the inside story of seminal events. She tells us that a ministerial colleague hid “in a cupboard” rather than meet families bereaved at Hillsborough. She then dilutes her own anecdote by saying this coward “shall remain nameless”. It is hard to disagree when she asserts that misuses of power are far too common. Many will also nod along when she suggests that abuses are more likely to occur when countries fall into the hands of nationalists and populists. The bleeding obvious examples are Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. It would have been more interesting to know what she now thinks, and whether there’s any regret, about her own flirtations with nationalist populism when she occupied the top seat. Her notorious “citizens of nowhere” speech to her first party conference as Tory leader was a fateful step down the road to the ruinously rock-hard form of Brexit that has been imposed on the UK. Speaking of which, she has weirdly inserted a self-justifying chapter about her vain attempts to get a Brexit deal through parliament, the failure that led to her being forced out of No 10 by Tory MPs. This chapter sits very jarringly in a book that is supposed to be about grave injustices. Contrary to her earlier claim that she is not interested in relitigating her prime ministership and settling scores, here she does precisely that. She presents herself as a woman piously motivated by wanting to do the right thing who was unreasonably thwarted by almost everyone else, including EU leaders, the Labour party and speaker John Bercow. Oddly, she has less to say about the Brextremists in her own party who were the principal saboteurs of her leadership. That there was no Conservative majority in the Commons, because she had thrown it away at the 2017 election, also had something to do with her inability to get a deal through parliament. So did the fact that she did not try to fashion a cross-party consensus about how Brexit should be done until it was far too late. She justifies the bizarre inclusion of this chapter about Brexit with the extraordinary assertion that opposition to her in parliament was another “abuse of power” because her opponents put their own interests (as she sees it) before the national interest (as she interprets it) by declining to permit her the deal that she wanted. She has enough self-awareness to realise that “some will find it hard to accept” this claim. Oh, it is way worse than that, Mrs May. It is absurd to count herself among the victims of the “abuse of power”. I am staggered that she thinks the travails of her prime ministership belong in the same category as the suffering inflicted on the casualties of the Hillsborough disaster, the Grenfell tragedy and the Windrush scandal. That suggestion is not just ridiculous, it is repulsive. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer • The Abuse of Power: Confronting Injustice in Public Life by Theresa May is published by Headline (£25).

As always, you can find more of our coverage and analysis here. Here’s a quick recap of today’s developments: Former US president Donald Trump faces 37 counts in connection with keeping hundreds of classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon. The National Archives issued a rare statement to respond to misleading statements made by Trump’s legal team. Detailing aspects of the Presidential Records Act, the Archives made it clear that “there is no history, practice, or provision in law for presidents to take official records with them when they leave office.” Trump twice disclosed national security information in separate incidents in 2021 and took steps to retain classified documents that he knew he could not keep because they had been subpoenaed by the justice department, the indictment reads. The former president also hoarded materials of the highest sensitivity after he left the White House, including documents on US nuclear programmes, potential military vulnerabilities of the US and allies, and plans for US retaliation in the event of an attack, it says. Special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Mar-a-Lago documents case, said in a brief remarks Friday that his office intended to seek “a speedy trial” against Trump, adding that was “consistent with the public interest”. However, Smith did not say exactly when a trial may be possible. The indictment also named Trump’s former valet, Walt Nauta, as a co-defendant, alleging that he entered into a conspiracy with Trump to obstruct justice, withheld documents or records, corruptly concealed documents in a federal investigation, engaged in a scheme to conceal and made false statements. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm ET. Posting on Truth Social, Trump announced he would be represented by defence lawyer Todd Blanche, while his attorneys Jim Trusty and John Rowley released a statement to say that they had quit working for him. A federal judge appointed by Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. Have a good evening! As we noted earlier, the federal judge initially put in place to oversee this criminal case against Trump was appointed by him and has acted favorably to him in the past. Aileen Cannon, a former prosecutor who ruled in Trump’s favor last year during the investigation – temporarily stalling the FBI’s probe – could significantly shape the outcome. As the Washington Post reports, Cannon could be the decider on whether Trump goes to trial before next November’s election, what evidence can be heard, and what counts or motions are included. Nominated by Trump in 2020, she was confirmed with help from Democrats (12 Democratic Senators voted in her favor to be exact) and has been on the bench for less than two years. The Post notes that she joined the conservative Federalist Society in law school, commenting that she agreed with “the limited role of the judiciary to say what the law is — not to make the law,” during her confirmation hearing. As promised by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Republican representatives are rising to Trump’s defense by attempting to poke holes in the Justice Department investigation. In a letter issued to Attorney General Merrick Garland today, Congressman and Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan raised questions around the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago that led to the discovery of classified materials Trump had previously claimed he no longer possessed. “The indictment creates, at the minimum, a serious appearance of a double standard and a miscarriage of justice,” he says in the letter, adding that “additional information recently obtained by the Committee about the Department’s execution of a search warrant on President Trump’s residence only reinforces our grave concerns that your reported actions are nothing more than a politically motivated prosecution.” As the New York Times reports, Jordan relied on “selective excerpts from an interview” with a former top FBI official, Steven D’Antuono, who raised concerns about the search warrant. Highlighting only the parts of the interview Jordan believed would help his case, he left out details shared by D’Antuono that Democrats said at the time did not cast Trump in a positive light. D’Antuono also told the panel that Trump was present when his lawyer turned over a letter to investigators misleading them that all classified documents were returned, signifying his direct involvement what might be an act of obstruction. Here’s more from the Times: But Mr. Jordan omitted several facts from his letter in an apparent effort to place Mr. D’Antuono’s account in the worst possible light. Mr. D’Antuono has told associates that he was not opposed to executing the search warrant, but wanted to give Mr. Trump’s legal team one last chance to hand over the documents before sending agents into his club — a position that his superiors overruled. Prosecutors believed that Mr. Trump’s lawyers had already misled them once, falsely certifying to the F.B.I. and the Justice Department that they had searched for documents at the club and turned over everything they could find. The 37-count indictment against Mr. Trump and one of his aides released on Friday laid out in detail the actions the former president took to deceive prosecutors and cause the lawyers to make the false certification.” Good afternoon readers! Gabrielle Canon here, taking over on the west coast. The National Archives has released a statement with a “Frequently Asked Questions” section that goes into detail on expectations and the Presidential Records Act, directly countering claims made by Trump and his legal team. “The Presidential Records Act (PRA) requires the President to separate personal documents from Presidential records before [sic] leaving office,” the Archives wrote. “There is no history, practice, or provision in law for presidents to take official records with them when they leave office to sort through, such as for a two-year period as described in some reports.” Tim Parlatore, who served as part of Trump’s legal team until recently, has repeatedly said the former president was operating within his rights, telling CNN that a president “is supposed to take the next two years after they leave office to go through all these documents to figure out what’s personal and what’s presidential.” The National Archives made it clear in their statement that this is not true and also highlighted how previous presidents handled their transition out of office. When President Obama left office in 2017, NARA took physical and legal custody of the records of his administration in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. NARA made arrangements to move the roughly 30 million pages of paper Presidential records of the Obama administration to a federally acquired, modified, and secured temporary facility that NARA leased in Hoffman Estates, IL, which meets NARA’s requirements for records storage and security. NARA moved the records to Hoffman Estates because of the intention of President Obama to build a Presidential Library in the Chicago area. You can read the statement in full here. Here’s a quick recap of today’s developments: Former US president Donald Trump faces 37 counts in connection with keeping hundreds of classified documents in his possession after leaving the White House, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon.

A federal judge appointed by Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. Donald Trump spent the morning playing golf with Florida Republican Carlos Gimenez, the New York Times’ Maggie Haberman reported earlier today. Gimenez later responded to Haberman’s tweet with a photo of him with the former president: A lawyer for the Republican congressman and serial fabulist, George Santos, has said that the co-signers on a $500,000 bail package connected to Santos’ federal indictment are members of his family. In a letter to a New York judge, attorney Joseph Murray appealed an order this week to reveal the identities of three people who guaranteed Santos’ $500,000 bond on fraud charges. Murray wrote: Defendant has essentially publicly revealed that the suretors are family members and not lobbyists, donors or others seeking to exert influence over the defendant. At his arraignment in Long Island last month, Santos, 34, pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of fraud, money laundering, theft of public funds and making false statements. The New York Times sought the identification of Santos’s bail guarantors, arguing they should be identified as they had a chance to exert political influence over a congressman. Other news outlets joined the Times in its effort. In news not related to Donald Trump but involving one of his supporters, Markus Maly of Virginia received a six-year prison sentence for his role in the January 6 attack on Congress, federal prosecutors announced Friday. A grand jury had previously found Maly, 49, guilty of interfering with police during a civil disorder, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon as well as entering and remaining in a restricted building while armed, among other charges, prosecutors said. Authorities established that Maly joined a mob of Trump supporters who rioted at the Capitol on the day Congress convened to certify the former president’s defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. He was convicted of spraying a chemical irritant at a line of police officers who were defending the Capitol’s lower west terrace. In addition to serving time in prison, Maly must also spend three years under supervision after his release, prosecutors said. His co-defendants Jeffrey Scott Brown and Peter Schwartz were also found guilty of roles in the case. Schwartz later received a 14-year prison sentence. And Brown was given a prison sentence of four years. Maly raised more than $16,000 in funds for his defense from an online campaign that described him as a January 6 prisoner of war, the Associated Press had reported earlier. Prosecutors sought to take that money back in the form of a fine, arguing that Maly had a public defender and did not owe any legal fees. But neither court records nor prosecutors’ announcement about Maly’s sentence mentioned a fine for him as part of his sentence. Maly is among more than 1,000 people to be charged in connection with the January 6 attack, according to prosecutors. Numerous defendants have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, the two top Democrats in the Congress, have released a joint statement calling for the indictment to “play out through the legal process, without any outside political or ideological interference”. The statement reads: No one is above the law – including Donald Trump. It goes on to say: We encourage Mr Trump’s supporters and critics alike to let this case proceed peacefully in court. The US secret service is preparing for Donald Trump’s appearance at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday, but the agency “will not seek any special accommodations outside of what would be required to ensure the former Presidents continued safety”, according to spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. A statement by Guglielmi reads: As with any site visited by a protectee, the Secret Service is in constant coordination with the necessary entities to ensure protective requirements are met, He added: We have the utmost confidence in the professionalism and commitment to security shared by our law enforcement partners in Florida. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm ET. Donald Trump took classified documents including information on nuclear weapons in the US and secret plans to attack a foreign country, according to a 49-page federal indictment unsealed Friday afternoon. The former US president, alongside a military valet, now faces a sweeping 37-count felony indictment related to the mishandling of classified documents. Here are five of the most shocking revelations in the indictment, according to my colleague Maya Yang. We have a clip of the statement by Jack Smith, the US justice department special counsel who filed charges against Donald Trump. In a short address earlier today, Smith said his team would seek “a speedy trial” after the department unsealed a 37-count indictment against the former president. Donald Trump ally, Republican Arizona representative Andy Biggs responded to Trump’s indictment from the justice department by saying that “we have now reached a war phase.” Biggs, who previously spoke out against Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg over Trump’s indictment in March, went on to add: Eye for an eye. John Bolton, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, has reacted to his former boss’s indictment, calling for his immediate withdrawal as a presidential candidate. With Donald Trump being the first US president to be federally indicted, what will come next? Will he go to prison? What are other Republicans, including his presidential contenders such as Florida governor Ron DeSantis, saying? The Guardian’s David Smith reports: It is often tempting to hype every Trump drama out of proportion and then lose sight of when something genuinely monumental has happened. Thursday night’s action by the justice department was genuinely monumental. First, it raises the question: what was Trump doing with government secrets? It was reported last month that prosecutors obtained an audio recording in which Trump talks about holding on to a classified Pentagon document related to a potential attack on Iran. Second, Trump could soon join a notorious club that includes Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac of France and Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. All have been prosecuted and convicted of corruption in the past 15 years. It’s Trump’s latest stress test for American democracy: can the state hold a former president accountable and apply the rule of law? There was a near miss for Richard Nixon, who could have faced federal charges over Watergate but was pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford. The White House knows it cannot afford to put a foot wrong. Joe Biden tries to avoid commenting on Trump’s myriad legal troubles. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also kept them at arm’s length by appointing Jack Smith as special counsel. It is Smith who investigated the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, says: “I don’t think he’s an overreaching prosecutor. He’s very rigorous and vigorous and independent and that’s what you want here and that’s what’s needed. I don’t think Merrick Garland had anything to do with it except appointing him.” For the full story, click here: Here are some of the images coming out Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort where he has been accused of possessing classified documents: Rick Wilson, the founder of the political action committee consisting of moderate Republicans, responded to Donald Trump’s indictment, saying that Trump is “utterly amoral.” He went on to add, “The man for trade in this indictment is precisely who so many Republicans to this day pretended he was not.” Smith urged the public to read the full indictment against Trump “to understand the scope and the gravity of the crimes charged”. He added that laws protecting national defence information “are critical” and “must be enforced”. Smith delivered a short statement, where he described US department of justice prosecutors working on the case as working to the “highest ethical standards”. He said it was “very important” to him that “the defendants in this case, must be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law”. He added: To that end, my office will seek a speedy trial in this matter, consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused. I very much look forward to presenting our case. • This post was amended on 12 June 2023. An earlier version omitted some key words when it quoted Smith as saying the defendants “must be presumed innocent guilty in a court of law”. Special counsel Jack Smith has begun his statement to reporters following the unsealing of the indictment of former President Donald Trump. Jack Smith, the special counsel who pursued criminal charges against Donald Trump, is due to speak to reporters following the unsealing of the indictment of former President Donald Trump. We will be following it live on the blog. You can also watch it here: Donald Trump has attacked the special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Mar-a-Lago documents case, in a social media post. Trump wrote: His wife is a Trump Hater, just as he is a Trump Hater—a deranged “psycho” that shouldn’t be involved in any case having to do with “Justice,” other than to look at Biden as a criminal, which he is! The indictment reads that some of the documents include some of the most sensitive US military secrets. One of the documents concerned “nuclear capabilities of a foreign country”, the indictment says. Materials came from the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies, the indictment says. It also includes photographs of Trump’s boxes on a ballroom stage, in a club bathroom and in a storage room, where some were laying on the floor. Here’s the full text of the federal indictment of Donald Trump: The indictment alleges that Trump “endeavored to obstruct the FBI and grand jury investigations and conceal his continued retention of classified documents”. It reads that the former president tried to obstruct investigations including by “suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that [he] did not have documents called for by the grand jury subpoena” and even “suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena”. President Joe Biden said he has not spoken to the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, as the justice department unsealed charges against Donald Trump. Asked by a reporter if he would speak to Garland, Biden responded: I have not spoken to him at all and I’m not going to speak to him. The indictment also says Trump directed his valet and aide, Walt Nauta, to move boxes of records to conceal them from his attorney and the FBI. Trump and Nauta both face a count of conspiracy to obstruct justice, according to the indictment. It goes on: The purpose of the conspiracy was for Trump to keep classified documents he has taken with him from the White House and to hide and conceal them from a federal grand jury. The indictment reads that Trump stored classified documents in “a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room” at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The indictment also writes that Trump described a Pentagon “plan of attack” and shared a classified map related to a military operation. The former president “showed and described a ‘plan of attack’ that Trump said was prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official” during a meeting at the Trump national golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the indictment reads. It says: Trump told the individuals that the plan was “highly confidential” and “secret”. The meeting included individuals who did not have security clearance, the indictment says. In a later meeting, Trump displayed “a classified map related to a military operation”, acknowledging he “should not be showing it to the representative and that the representative should not get too close”, the indictment reads. The indictment reads that Trump stored in his boxes “information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack, and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack”. It goes on: The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods. The indictment charging the former US president Donald Trump with mishandling classified documents has been unsealed. We’ll bring you the key lines as we have them. In the meantime, you can read the indictment here. Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating former president Donald Trump over retention of classified government records, is expected to make a statement at 3pm ET (GMT 1900). The federal indictment of Donald Trump and his associate, Walt Nauta, has been unsealed, CNN is reporting. We’ll bring you more as it comes. Joe Biden, who is at an event in North Carolina, was asked about Trump’s indictment. NBC News’s Kelly O’Donnell reports that the president replied: I have no comment at all. Here’s some more detail on the reports that federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in addition to the former president as part of the criminal investigation into Trump’s retention of national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort and obstruction of justice. Nauta, a former military valet, worked for Trump at the White House before going to work for the former president at his Florida resort. The Wall Street Journal reports that Nauta became a focus of the investigation after surveillance footage showed him moving boxes from a storage room before and after investigators issued a subpoena seeking the return of all government documents in Trump’s possession. Investigators spoke with Nauta at least twice and asked him to submit to further questioning, but he refused further questioning, the paper said. The charges against Nauta and Trump have yet to be formally announced. A lawyer for Nauta declined to comment, the Wall Street Journal reported. My colleague Hugo Lowell reported yesterday that Nauta’s lawyer has submitted court papers describing a meeting at which a top federal prosecutor brought up his application to be a judge when they tried to gain the valet’s cooperation last year. You can read the piece here: The former vice-president, Mike Pence, has again called for the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to unseal the indictment against Donald Trump immediately. Speaking at a campaign rally in New Hampshire today, Pence called on Garland to “stop hiding” and to “stand up and explain to us why this was necessary before the sun sets today”. Pence said: The American people deserve to know the basis of this unprecedented action. They deserve to know today. Once the facts and the laws are explained and revealed in full to the American people, we can all make our own judgment. Here’s a clip of Pence’s speech: Here are some images of President Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, arriving at Seymour Johnson air force base in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The pair are scheduled to make stops at a community college in Rocky Mount to discuss workforce training programmes as well as at the Fort Liberty military base to talk about new efforts to help veterans and families of those serving in the military. Hillary Clinton has also publicly responded to Donald Trump’s indictment, tweeting a meme of herself wearing a hat with “but her emails” on it, with the caption: Bringing this back in light of recent news. Get a limited-edition But Her Emails hat and support @onwardtogether groups working to strengthen our democracy. Trump repeatedly criticised his 2016 presidential election opponent for using a personal email server while she served as secretary of state under the Obama administration. Following a years-long internal investigation into Clinton’s use of private email, the state department said it had found “no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information”. The White House’s deputy press secretary, Olivia Dalton, repeatedly declined to comment on the federal indictment of Donald Trump as she faced questions from reporters today. Dalton said: We’re just not going to comment on this case and would refer you to the DOJ, which runs its criminal investigations independently. She went on to say that President Biden “is a president who respects the rule of law and has said that since day one, that’s precisely why we’re not commenting here. He believes in respecting the independence of the DOJ and protecting the integrity of their processes”. She added: That’s, again, why we’ll leave it there. Dalton was speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, as Biden flew to North Carolina. The president has announced a new executive order aimed at helping military spouses and families. Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump’s valet in addition to the former president as part of the criminal investigation examining retention of national security documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort and obstruction of justice, according to two people familiar with the matter. The exact charges against the valet, Walt Nauta, were unclear because the indictment remains under seal. One lawyer for Nauta could not confirm the indictment and another lawyer for Nauta who is off on vacation could not immediately be reached for comment. Nauta has been under scrutiny for potential obstruction charges after he told prosecutors that Trump had instructed him to move boxes of potentially classified documents out of the Mar-a-Lago storage room after the Justice department had issued a subpoena for the return of any such papers. The lawyers for Nauta were also told last year by prosecutors that he had given them potentially conflicting testimony that could give rise to false statements charges, the people said. Prosecutors recommended that Nauta cooperate against Trump but were rebuffed. An aide to Donald Trump, Walt Nauta, has been indicted alongside the former president in special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents, according to several reports. Trump has also posted about the news on Truth Social. He said: I have just learned that the “Thugs” from the Department of Injustice will be Indicting a wonderful man, Walt Nauta, a member of the U.S. Navy, who served proudly with me in the White House, retired as Senior Chief, and then transitioned into private life as a personal aide. He has done a fantastic job! They are trying to destroy his life, like the lives of so many others, hoping that he will say bad things about “Trump.” He is strong, brave, and a Great Patriot. The FBI and DOJ are CORRUPT! Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is vying for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has responded to the news of Trump’s indictment. Posting to Twitter, Haley said: This is not how justice should be pursued in our country. The American people are exhausted by the prosecutorial overreach, double standards, and vendetta politics. It’s time to move beyond the endless drama and distractions. Jim Trusty and John Rowley, two lawyers representing Donald Trump, have issued a statement to say they have quit working for him. The joint statement reads that the pair “tendered our resignations as counsel to President Trump, and we will no longer represent him on either the indicted case or the January 6 investigation”. It goes on: It has been an honor to have spent the last year defending him, and we know he will be vindicated in his battle against the Biden Administration’s partisan weaponization of the American justice system. Now that the case has been filed in Miami, this is a logical moment for us to step aside and let others carry the cases through to completion. President Joe Biden had no advance knowledge of the indictment against Trump and found out about it like everyone else, according to the White House’s spokesperson, Olivia Dalton. Here’s the full statement by Donald Trump announcing a shake-up of his legal team. Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote: For purposes of fighting the Greatest Witch Hunt of all time, now moving to the Florida Courts, I will be represented by Todd Blanche, Esq., and a firm to be named later. I want to thank Jim Trusty and John Rowley for their work, but they were up against a very dishonest, corrupt, evil, and “sick” group of people, the likes of which has not been seen before. We will be announcing additional lawyers in the coming days. When will Joe Biden be Indicted for his many crimes against our Nation? MAGA! Donald Trump has announced a shake-up of his legal team on his social media platform, Truth Social, my colleague Hugo Lowell reports. The US senate judiciary committee chairman, Dick Durbin, has said the investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith should be allowed to continue “without interference”. In a statement on Friday, Durbin added that Donald Trump “should be afforded the due process protections that he is guaranteed by our constitution, just like any other American”. Mike Pence has called on the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to address the nation and for the federal indictment against Trump to be unsealed. Speaking in an interview with the conservative radio host, Hugh Hewitt, this morning, the former vice-president said it was “totally unacceptable” that the justice department had not yet released the indictment to the public. Pence said: I think before the sun sets today, the attorney general of the United States should be standing in front of the American people, should unseal this indictment, should provide the American people with all the facts and information here. And the American people be able to judge for themselves whether this is just the latest incident of weaponization and politicization at the justice department or it’s something different. Will the federal criminal indictment prevent Trump from election campaigning or, if he wins the 2024 race, taking office? Reuters has the answer – no and no. This becomes surreal when you project the scenario forward, but here goes some of the Reuters explainer: The indictment is under seal, but Trump’s lawyer said he is charged with seven criminal counts including violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. None of those would bar Trump from office if he is convicted. A trial would take place many months from now, and Trump can freely campaign during this time. The U.S. Constitution only requires that presidential candidates be natural-born U.S. citizens who are at least 35 years old and have lived in the country for 14 years. Trump said on Thursday on his Truth Social platform that he is innocent. He would be free to campaign even if he is convicted and sent to prison, and legal experts say there would be no basis to block his swearing-in as president even if he is incarcerated, though this would pose extraordinary logistical and security questions. It is unlikely that the prosecution would proceed if Trump won the November 2024 election. The U.S. Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, and presidents are the top federal law enforcement officers in the country. Federal prosecutors generally serve at their pleasure. The U.S. Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted. The department can deviate from policy in ‘extraordinary circumstances’ with the approval of the U.S. attorney general.” This all reminds us that Trump was not charged in the Russia investigation while he was the occupant of the White House, as special counsel Robert Mueller adhered to received protocol – despite seemingly ample evidence alleging that Trump had at least obstructed justice by hampering the inquiry. Mitt Romney is one of Donald Trump’s few Republican detractors in the Senate, or anywhere in Congress, for that matter. Here’s what Romney – who was the GOP’s unsuccessful nominee for president in the 2012 election – has to say about Trump’s federal indictment: Like all Americans, Mr Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence. The government has the burden of proving its charges beyond a reasonable doubt and securing a unanimous verdict by a South Florida jury. By all appearances, the Justice Department and special counsel have exercised due care, affording Mr Trump the time and opportunity to avoid charges that would not generally have been afforded to others. Mr Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so. These allegations are serious and if proven, would be consistent with his other actions offensive to the national interest, such as withholding defensive weapons from Ukraine for political reasons and failing to defend the Capitol from violent attack and insurrection. The good and non-partisan folks at C-SPAN have unearthed a clip from 2016 in which none other than Donald Trump himself vows to take a hard line against the leaking of classified information. Wonder if he stands by these comments today: Ever since Donald Trump rode down that escalator in 2015 and began his journey to the White House, the business mogul’s enemies have been waiting for the day when the Republican party ditches him. Today is not that day. Just take a look at what speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had to say last night after news of the indictment broke: It’s a sentiment that’s being repeated among House Republicans, and the party at large. In fact, the real news will be if any Republican who has not already decides that today is the day they’ll break with Trump. We’ll let you know if that happens. A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump who last year drew scrutiny for a ruling that was seen as deferential to the former president may oversee proceedings in the case over his possession of classified documents, a source familiar with the summons told the Guardian. US district judge Aileen Cannon has been listed on the summons sent to Trump’s lawyers, the source said. You may remember the judge’s name from last year, when she granted a request from Trump’s attorneys to appoint a special master to review the records federal agents seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in August. The special master review delayed the justice department’s investigation into the materials and how they ended up at Trump’s south Florida property, but in December, Cannon’s decision was overturned by the unanimous decision of a federal appeals court. You can read more about the whole saga below: Now that Donald Trump has been indicted, what happens next? The Guardian’s Joan E Greve has the answer: Donald Trump is preparing for his second arraignment in two months after learning that he would face seven federal charges in connection to his mishandling of classified documents. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm, although the exact charges he will face are still unclear as the seven-count indictment remains under seal. On Fox News Digital on Thursday night he said he would plead not guilty. After news of the indictment broke, Trump’s allies rallied to his defense as the US braced for the unprecedented spectacle of a former president forced to defend himself against federal criminal charges. Fresh off the news that Donald Trump is being indicted on several felonies related to possessing classified government documents, CNN reports this morning that an audio recording has emerged of him bragging about keeping a “secret” military document that had not been declassified. “As president, I could have declassified, but now I can’t,” Trump says, according to a transcript of the recording that CNN obtained. The network reports that the audio recording captures the sound of paper rustling, indicating that Trump may have actually been waving the document around as he was talking about it. “Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,” Trump says in the transcript. “This was done by the military and given to me.” Prosecutors have this recording, CNN says. Here’s more from their story: Former President Donald Trump acknowledged on tape in a 2021 meeting that he had retained “secret” military information that he had not declassified, according to a transcript of the audio recording obtained by CNN. “As president, I could have declassified, but now I can’t,” Trump says, according to the transcript. CNN obtained the transcript of a portion of the meeting where Trump is discussing a classified Pentagon document about attacking Iran. In the audio recording, which CNN previously reported was obtained by prosecutors, Trump says that he did not declassify the document he’s referencing, according to the transcript. Trump was indicted Thursday on seven counts in special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. Details from the indictment have not been made public, so it unknown whether any of the seven counts refer to the recorded 2021 meeting. Still, the tape is significant because it shows that Trump had an understanding the records he had with him at Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House remained classified. Publicly, Trump has claimed that all the documents he brought with him to his Florida residence are declassified, while he’s railed against the special counsel’s investigation as a political witch hunt attempting to interfere with his 2024 presidential campaign. CNN first reported last week that prosecutors had obtained the audio recording of Trump’s 2021 meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort, with two people working on the autobiography of Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows as well as aides employed by the former president, including communications specialist Margo Martin. The transcript of the audio recording suggests that Trump is showing the document he’s discussing to those in the room. Several sources have told CNN the recording captures the sound of paper rustling, as if Trump was waving the document around, though is not clear if it was the actual Iran document. “Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,” Trump says at one point, according to the transcript. “This was done by the military and given to me.” Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is making history again, and not in a good way. Yesterday evening, he announced that he would soon be indicted on federal charges related to the classified documents discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort last year, the first time in US history a former president has faced such allegations. While the justice department has yet to confirm the charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed late last year to investigate the secret materials matter along with Trump’s involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the overall effort to prevent Joe Biden from taking office, the news has become yet another rallying cry for Republicans – even Trump’s opponents for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination. Florida governor Ron DeSantis vowed to “bring accountability” to the justice department, while senator Tim Scott lamented “a justice system where the scales are weighted”. GOP politicians have generally flocked to defend Trump whenever he faces legal trouble, such as when the Manhattan district attorney separately indicted him in March, and today is no different. We’ll keep you posted on this developing story. Here’s what else is going on today: Joe Biden has a long day of travel in North Carolina, which will give the traveling press corps plenty of opportunities to ask him what he thinks of the charges against Trump. Principal deputy White House press secretary Olivia Dalton will brief reporters around 10.30am eastern time, and you can bet that she, too, will be asked about the indictment. Matt Gaetz, a prominent Trump ally in the House of Representatives, is the subject of a new investigation by the chamber’s ethics committee, Punchbowl News reports. It’s unclear what matter they are looking into, but earlier this year, Gaetz said the justice department ended a sex trafficking inquiry into him without charges."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-18T07:00:32Z","webTitle":"How Florida’s Republican supermajority handed Ron DeSantis unfettered power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/18/ron-desantis-florida-republican-supermajority-2024","fields":{"bodyText":"If there’s one word Floridians have heard plenty of since their Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, was sworn in for a second term last month, it is “freedom”. The rightwing politician, expected by many to seek his party’s 2024 presidential nomination, sprinkles the word freely as he ramps up the “anti-woke” crusade he believes can propel him to the White House. It turns out, following a special legislative session last week that handed DeSantis victory after victory in his culture wars against Disney, transgender communities, students, migrants and communities of color, the person with the greatest freedom in Florida to do exactly as he pleases is the governor himself. In November, voters granted DeSantis’s wish of a veto-proof Republican supermajority in the state legislature. In a five-day session, those politicians validated every one of his demands. They granted DeSantis total control of the board governing Disney, the theme park giant with whom he feuded over his anti-LGBTQ+ “don’t say gay” law. They gave him permission to fly migrants from anywhere in the US to destinations of his choosing, for political purposes, then send the bill to Florida’s taxpayers. And they handed unprecedented prosecutorial powers to his newly created, hand-picked office of election “integrity”, pursuing supposed cases of voter fraud. The special session is over but DeSantis’s devotion to seeking retribution against those who disagree with him is not. Last week, after a backlash, the Florida High School Athletic Association backed away from forcing female students to chronicle their menstrual histories on medical forms, a requirement seen by many as a thinly-veiled attempt to keep transgender athletes out of girls’ sports. Exactly one week later, a Republican House committee proposed allowing DeSantis to turf out those who made the decision and replace them with his own appointments. It’s a familiar playbook: the Disney legislation allows the governor to supplant sitting officials on its governing tax authority with his own picks; his “hostile takeover” of the liberal New College of Florida last month was accomplished by swamping its board of trustees with hand-picked allies and conservative Christians. In what critics say was a particularly petty act earlier this month, DeSantis moved to strip the liquor license from the non-profit Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation because it hosted a drag show, which some children attended with parents. The threats keep coming. The notoriously thin-skinned DeSantis wants to cut state ties with the College Board, which criticised him for a “PR stunt and posturing” when he demanded it revise an advanced placement college course on African American studies he said “lacked educational value”. “No politician should silence the stories of Black and brown people who helped create our country. Our democracy and constitutional values must transcend such hateful and callous political agendas,” said Tiffani Lemon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Others accuse DeSantis of fascism, among them the progressive Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost, whose vocal criticism of the governor long predated his election in November. “If you disagree with Ron DeSantis he’ll abuse his power to close down your business, take over your school, remove your classes and unconstitutionally fire you,” Frost said in a tweet. “I encourage folks to look up the definition of fascism then read these headlines.” Other Florida Democrats see the DeSantis-ordered special legislative session as his “get out jail free card”, sweeping away legal obstacles and other hurdles that threatened to stall his policy objectives. His original plan to abolish the Disney authority would have saddled residents with $1bn in bond debt, so instead he asked the legislature to rename and restructure it. Judges threw out charges against several ex-felons the governor said voted illegally because his state office lacked prosecutorial authority, so a new law was drafted to give it. DeSantis’s administration was sued for flying migrants from Texas to Massachusetts in a “vile political stunt” stunt last year, because the existing law restricted migrant removals to those physically in Florida. So he changed the law. “It’s just a clear example of DeSantis changing the law because he broke the law,” said Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state congresswoman who voted against the new measure to allow the governor to fly migrants anywhere. “Republicans like Ron DeSantis don’t care about the rules. If they don’t like the rules, they change them. And if they can’t change them they try to destroy them, as we saw with the [January 6] insurrection.” ••• Gregory Koger, chair of political science at the University of Miami, said the issues the legislature addressed suggested “speed over thought” when the DeSantis administration was planning its strategies. “It’s not unusual at all to see legislators and executives fixing problems in the laws that they have passed,” he said. “You could have had a slow, bipartisan, well-thought-out approach to changing the relationship between Florida and Disney, but that isn’t what we observed. We saw a law being drafted and passed as an act of retribution, and now they have to come back and say, ‘Well, when we passed our act of retribution, here’s what we actually meant.’ “Same with changing the guidelines for Florida to fly migrants. That seems like an effort to back out of a legal challenge to their behavior by retroactively saying the legislature is actually OK tricking people into getting on a plane in Texas and flying them from there, rather than finding actual undocumented people in Florida.” In an email to the Guardian, DeSantis’s press secretary, Bryan Griffin, defended the governor, saying he was bringing “a new era of accountability and transparency” to Disney, Florida’s biggest employer. “Businesses in Florida should operate on a level playing field,” Griffin said. “In 1967, the Florida legislature created the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which gifted extraordinary special privileges to a single corporation. “Until Governor DeSantis acted, the Walt Disney Company maintained sole control over the district. This power amounted to an unaccountable corporate kingdom.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-11T08:27:12Z","webTitle":"Afternoon Update: Matildas fever grips Australia; News Corp profits dive; and Melbourne e-scooters to ‘shout’ at rule breakers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/11/afternoon-update-matildas-fever-grips-australia-news-corp-profits-dive-and-melbourne-e-scooters-to-shout-at-rule-breakers","fields":{"bodyText":"Good Afternoon.

Nuclear fusion involves smashing together light elements such as hydrogen to form heavier elements, releasing a huge burst of energy in the process. The approach, which gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars, has been hailed as having huge potential as a sustainable, low-carbon energy source. However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition. That was, it seems, until now. According to a report in the Financial Times, which has yet to be confirmed by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that is behind the work, researchers have managed to release 2.5 MJ of energy after using just 2.1 MJ to heat the fuel with lasers. Dr Robbie Scott, of the Science and Technology Facilities Council’s (STFC) Central Laser Facility (CLF) Plasma Physics Group, who contributed to this research, described the results as a “momentous achievement”. “Fusion has the potential to provide a near-limitless, safe, clean, source of carbon-free baseload energy,” he said. “This seminal result from the National Ignition Facility is the first laboratory demonstration of fusion ‘energy-gain’ – where more fusion energy is output than input by the laser beams. The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated. “The experiment demonstrates unambiguously that the physics of Laser Fusion works,” he added. “In order to transform NIF’s result into power production a lot of work remains, but this is a key step along the path.” Prof Jeremy Chittenden, professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, agreed. “If what has been reported is true and more energy has been released than was used to produce the plasma, that is a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting,” he said. “It proves that the long sought-after goal, the ‘holy grail’ of fusion, can indeed be achieved.” But experts have stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is a long way from being a mainstay of the energy landscape. To start with, 0.4MJ is about 0.1kWh – about enough energy to boil a kettle. “To turn fusion into a power source we’ll need to boost the energy gain still further,” said Chittenden. “We’ll also need to find a way to reproduce the same effect much more frequently and much more cheaply before we can realistically turn this into a power plant.” Prof Justin Wark, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, added that while, in principle, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory could produce such a result about once a day, a fusion power plant would need to do it 10 times a second. And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves. However, Chittenden stressed the NIF was designed for a scientific demonstration, not as a power plant. “The efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,” he said. “Anyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor,” he added. “The experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.” The latest results, if true, top the last big breakthrough by the facility which came just last year when it was announced that the team had hit 70% of the laser energy put in to the experiment released as nuclear energy. • This article was amended on 13 December 2022 to replace a Rubicon reference, on usage grounds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-21T21:20:09Z","webTitle":"Republicans criticize Biden’s trip to Kyiv as Putin withdraws from nuclear treaty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/21/republicans-reaction-biden-trip-kyiv-ukraine-putin","fields":{"bodyText":"For Joe Biden to safely visit Ukraine, the White House spirited him out of the country in the middle of the night and made reporters traveling with him swear a temporary oath of secrecy – none of which could protect the president from attacks by Republicans. The journey was only complicated further by an unexpected announcement. In a speech marking a year since he sent his armies over Ukraine’s borders in an ill-fated attempt to take Kyiv, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced his country would no longer participate in the last nuclear arms control treaty with the United States still standing, and accused the west of posing an existential threat to his country. “They want to inflict a strategic defeat on us and claim our nuclear facilities,” Putin said, accusing Washington of striving “to build an American-style world where there is only one master”. Biden continues his travels in Poland, but conservative Republicans have scrambled to downplay the president’s decision to travel to an active foreign war zone without a significant American military presence, arguing in appearances on Fox News that Biden would have been better off visiting the border with Mexico, or the Ohio town stricken by toxic waste spilled from a derailed train. “The president’s now spent more time in Kyiv than he has at our southern border,” said Kevin Hern, a House Republican from Oklahoma who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee. Fellow House Republican David Kustoff gave Biden “kudos” for the trip but brought up the derailment earlier this month of a train carrying toxic chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, a village of 4,761 residents where many are demanding answers about the spill’s health effects. “There are a lot of people here in the US that would say he probably should have gone to Ohio and visited with the people who have been afflicted by the derailment first,” Kustoff said on Fox News. On Twitter, the rightwing lawmaker and Ukraine foe Marjorie Taylor Greene said Biden “chose Ukraine over America, while forcing the American people to pay for Ukraine’s government and war. I can not express how much Americans hate Joe Biden.” The comments from Republicans were, in many ways, business as usual for the Biden presidency. The GOP has hammered him since practically the start of his administration for the increase in migrant arrivals on the southern border, and more recently seized on the East Palestine derailment to argue his administration is turning a blind eye to an environmental disaster. “That was the biggest slap in the face. That tells you right now he doesn’t care about us,” East Palestine’s mayor Trent Conaway said of Biden’s Ukraine trip in an appearance on Fox News. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on Tuesday it would take over the response to the 3 February derailment in the eastern Ohio town, with Biden’s EPA chief Michael Regan vowing rail operator Norfolk Southern “will pay for cleaning up the mess they created and for the trauma they’ve inflicted on this community”. Last month, Biden visited Texas’s border with Mexico shortly after he announced new restrictions on migrants who arrive in the United States, which drew opposition from advocacy groups and progressive Democrats. But the comments from the Republican lawmakers could also be harbingers of major political battles to come. Since Russia’s invasion, the US has supplied Kyiv with about $30bn worth of pivotal weaponry and other aid, but the country will likely need more to hold off Moscow’s troops. That will require the agreement of both the Biden administration and his Democratic allies controlling the Senate, as well as the Republicans in control of the House of Representatives. “We’re all for Ukraine, we support their effort against the Russians as we approach the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, but the message that I get from constituents all across west Tennessee and I think other members of Congress get is, we need to stop the spending,” Kustoff said. “We need to take care of people at home first before we look to take care of people across the world.” The sentiment wasn’t unanimous among Republicans. GOP senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement that he was “very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine”, and called it “the right signal to send at the right time”. He urged the Biden administration to keep pressure on Russia by designating it a state sponsor of terrorism, and to send advanced fighter jets to Ukraine. “Words are powerful, but they must be followed by powerful actions as well,” Graham said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-19T10:00:09Z","webTitle":"The pet I’ll never forget: Emmeline the tiny bat taught me the power of empathy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/19/the-pet-ill-never-forget-emmeline-the-tiny-bat-taught-me-the-power-of-empathy","fields":{"bodyText":"When I was growing up, there was a woman in our Devon village called Sylvia, who was known as the Bat Lady. She didn’t live in a grotto dripping with stalactites, but in a 1960s detached four-bedroom house, with carpeting up the side of the bathtub and a serving hatch in the kitchen. She was known as the Bat Lady not because she stalked alleys in latex, but because she rescued and rehabilitated injured bats. She kept them in her cool, dark loft, in cages she crafted from green netting and planks of recycled wood. One day, when I was about nine, my mum took me over to Sylvia’s house. The bats hung there, blinking blearily through beady nocturnal eyes. Their wings were wrapped around them like leathery papooses, and they snuggled inside, like gothic babies suspended in the gloom. Entranced, I asked if I could have one. Sylvia laughed her tinkly laugh and said I could look after a bat if she ever went on holiday. True to her word, when she did go off on her travels, probably somewhere like Easter Island or Borneo – Sylvia didn’t do anything by halves – I was allowed to foster Emmeline. She was a pipistrelle, one of the world’s smallest bats, weighing in at 3g. The size of a conker. She arrived with her bespoke cage and a container writhing with live mealworms. I insisted on keeping Emmeline in my room, and was comforted during the night by the papery sound of her wings as she flitted around the cage. I was terrified at night as a child, and loved the thought of a conscious creature waking up and doing things just as I was going to sleep. She was looking out for me. Once, weighing her gently between thumb and forefinger, feeling I could crush her at any minute, I held a mealworm aloft, and a tiny tongue flicked out to taste it. Then, with surprising ferocity, she lunged forward and gulped down the whole thing. I was impressed. It would be like eating an entire Subway footlong in one bite. In that moment, Emmeline taught me empathy in the most literal and physical of ways. The fact that she was utterly reliant on me for sustenance and life hit home in one of those childhood lightbulb moments you remember for ever. It was my first experience of sole responsibility for another living thing – and my last, unless you count the cactus that sat on my desk from 2015 to 2020. It was chucked in the bin when lockdown hit. Emmeline, however, made a full recovery, and flew free. • This article was amended on 23 June 2023 to replace an earlier photograph with a more suitable image."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
