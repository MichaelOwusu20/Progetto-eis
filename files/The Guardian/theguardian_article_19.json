Mikhail Khodorkovsky told the foreign affairs committee that Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman who finally admitted in September 2022 that he had founded the group, had as much access to Putin as the formal government officials. He said Prigozhin was behind the recent appointment of General Sergey Surovikin to head the military operation in Ukraine and was working in close conjunction with him in Ukraine. Wagner Group’s popularity in Russia had surged in recent months since it was able to argue that its existence acted as an alternative to wider mobilisation, Khodorkovsky said. However, he added that the Wagner Group, with only roughly 7,000 forces, would not take the blame if the military operations failed in Ukraine, since the Russian forces are 150,000 to 200,000. The two that will take the blame will be Yury Kovalchuk, Putin’s financier and Shoigu, the men believed to have most often pressed Putin to launch the invasion and predicted Kyiv could be seized in three days. Khodorkovsky accused Putin of using mercenary forces such as the Wagner Group, which often recruits people from prisons, because it allowed him to lie, deny responsibility and implement an illegal foreign policy. “They are engaged in terrorism and killing”, he said, adding the UK and other countries had been too slow to proscribe the group as such despite its clear “terrorist” activity in Africa. Restarting troop conscription would be a very dangerous political decision for Putin, Khodorkovsky said, adding that resistance to the mobilisation had forced him to bring the process to a premature end. He claimed 700,000 people had left Russia after the mobilisation and said this represented “a serious blow to Putin’s defence industry and for the economy of Russia”, potentially a more significant blow to Russia’s economy than any normal sanctions imposed by the west. Khodorkovsky urged the UK to take in many of these Russian exiles saying: “These people are the most active and educated people with certain financial means including 30,000 Russian programmers mainly based in Cyprus. It has significantly hit Russia’s ability to pursue the cyber war.” Similarly, he said many Russian engineers needed for the reproduction of high-precision weapons had left the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-02T10:00:01Z","webTitle":"Beijing Rules by Bethany Allen review – a new world order","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/aug/02/beijing-rules-by-bethany-allen-review-a-new-world-order","fields":{"bodyText":"It can be a little dizzying to survey the abrupt shifts in Britain’s relationship with China. It is less than eight years since the then chancellor, George Osborne, touted a “golden era” of closer ties, becoming the first serving cabinet minister to visit Xinjiang. That region is now synonymous with the persecution of Uyghurs and other minorities, its vast network of camps a modern-day gulag archipelago. The widely documented atrocities meted out include torture and forced sterilisation. Last month parliament warned that Beijing poses not just a commercial challenge, but an “existential threat” to our democracy. The whiplash in Britain may be particularly extreme, but most western countries have charted a similar policy course over the last decade, slowly coming to the realisation that the neoliberal consensus forged after the fall of the Berlin Wall – that economic opening would lead to political reform – might be wrong. All this makes Beijing Rules a timely read. Bethany Allen, a Tapei-based reporter for Axios, documents how China has wielded extraordinary power beyond its own borders, exploiting western naivety and greed, and weaponising its own fast-growing economy in a bid to reshape the world order. Part of this includes stifling dissent not just at home but abroad; she describes in chilling detail how the online meeting platform Zoom, flush with pandemic cash and success, helped Beijing go after US-based dissidents, arguing that its actions were necessary to comply with Chinese law. The company handed over information stored on US servers about Zoom users connected to Xinjiang and disrupted a meeting about the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, even though it was hosted by a US citizen – former student leader Wang Dan – who was in the US at the time. Wang told Allen: “It kind of hurt the democracy in the United States. It’s not only an attack on Chinese dissidents. It’s an attack on American society. Because Zoom is an American company.” (Zoom said a China-based executive was fired over the incident for “violating company policies” and has subsequently said that it will not allow any requests from the Chinese government to affect anyone outside China.) Parts of the book feel like familiar if useful surveys of issues that have been prominent in news coverage over recent years, including the Chinese response to the Covid pandemic, the ramping up of disinformation, and Beijing’s reaction to the 2019 Hong Kong protest movement. Allen shows how Beijing has deployed de facto “sanctions” on industries as diverse as Norway’s salmon fisheries and America’s NBA when governments, companies or individuals cross its red lines. But there are also sections that are likely to be startling to most readers, including one on China’s covert political operations overseas. Much of this activity comes under the auspices of the blandly named United Front Work Department, an organisation charged with increasing the Communist party’s influence in wider society. Too often it has been dismissed as a dull bureaucratic relic. But its budget, estimated at between $1.4bn and $1.8bn, is testament to its importance. Its activities range from the apparently absurd to the terrifying, whether that’s trying to manipulate twin-cities programmes or placing a suspected spy at the heart of the US intelligence community. Lest that sounds too depressing, Beijing Rules also charts how governments from Canberra to Berlin to Ottawa woke up to the threat staring them in the face – albeit belatedly – and ends with a list of suggestions for protecting democracy that reads more like a manifesto than a policy paper. Allen makes a powerful case for more coordinated western intervention, to both support companies in the face of Chinese competition and coercion, and force them to respect the liberal values that have made our economies so powerful in the first place. Because even the biggest corporations are smaller than the Chinese state and its economy, they can be picked off fairly easily when standing alone. “There’s nothing wrong with shaming a US company for investing in Xinjiang or self-censoring to please Beijing. But purely placing the blame on individual commercial actors for succumbing to the innovative economic statecraft of a trade superpower is misguided,” she writes. “Through new laws, regulations, and multilateral institutions, we need to relink economic and democratic rights, both domestically and internationally.” Allen also manages the feat – more difficult than it should be, to judge by the way too many people write and speak – of untangling legitimate concerns about the Chinese government’s behaviour from the disturbing rise in racism towards people of East Asian heritage. This discrimination was almost certainly one reason many casual observers, particularly on the left, failed to understand, appreciate or support important policy shifts in the US during the Trump administration. Chinese citizens abroad, and people of Chinese heritage, are “the first and the last victims of this dynamic,” she writes. “They are caught in the middle, between a powerful Leninist state with expansive global aims on the one hand and the legitimate fears and illegitimate fear mongering and racism that simmer in host countries on the other.” If the past 10 years have been a time of slow awakening to reality – namely that, amid talk of a second cold war, this confrontation with an autocratic superpower will be more complicated and difficult than the last – Allen remains optimistic that the next decade will see liberal democracies try to use that new understanding to defend themselves and their values. As her carefully assembled argument demonstrates, it’s essential that they do. • Beijing Rules: China’s Quest for Global Influence by Bethany Allen is published by John Murray.

Now a new exhibit at San Francisco’s de Young fine arts museum gives viewers a new way to connect to the artist himself. Ansel Adams in Our Time, on display from 8 April through 23 July, brings together more than a 100 of Adams’s works alongside 23 contemporary photographers who reflect and build on it. The exhibition also returns Adams to the city where he launched his career and continues the conversations he began about conservation and national parks in his first exhibition at San Francisco’s de Young museum nearly a century ago. The exhibition will include some of Adams’s most famous works, including a photograph of Half Dome under the moon and a beloved self-portrait featuring the artist’s shadow – complete with his arm extended to the sky, light meter in hand – against a rock face in Monument Valley. Alongside, the gallery walls will also portray perspectives from new artists whose photos build on Adams’s work while seeking broader reflections on the natural world and the way people engage and impact it. These include collages created by Mark Klett and Byron Wolfe, who layer photographs from Adams and others over more modern captures, leaving viewers with panoramic views of Yosemite through time. Catherine Opie’s photographs sharply contrasts Adams by casting similar subjects in a colored blur while CJ Heyliger, the exhibit’s youngest artist, showcased beauty in the mundane by focusing on details in landscapes less sought after, like glass scattered across the desert. “It is great to see contemporary photographers taking up his legacy and looking at it, criticizing it, and finding new ways to approach these problems that Adams was addressing in his photographs years ago,” said Sarah Mackay, an assistant curator for the show. ‘Ahead of his time’ A master technician, Adams stewarded his images through an arduous photographic process, starting with lugging large cameras up steep terrain, enduring long waits for good light, and finally the metered dance – set to the beat of the metronome he once relied on as a musician – of darkroom development that granted him ultimate control over the final outcome. But in his writings and recordings, Adams credits his impact not to his technique, but to his eye. “The whole world is, to me, very much ‘alive,’ all the little growing things, even the rocks,” Adams once wrote. “I can’t look at a swell bit of grass and earth, for instance, without feeling the essential life – the things going on – within them,” he said. “The same goes for a mountain, or a bit of the ocean, or a magnificent piece of old wood.” His work has taken on renewed urgency as the iconic locations he photographed across the American west – including Death Valley, Grand Teton and Yosemite – grapple with a changing climate. Positioning Adams’s work alongside that of contemporary environmental artists offers visitors a new framing of the climate crisis and the importance of conservation. “The thing I find so exciting is realizing how ahead of his time Ansel Adams was in terms of thinking about these issues,” said Karen Haas, lane senior curator of Photographs Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Adams is perhaps most associated with Yosemite national park, and his images of its sweeping views and soaring granite slabs through the seasons helped shape the park’s identity while it in turn shaped him as a photographer. Armed with what he called the “spiritual-emotional” connection to the park and other wild landscapes, Adams’s portrayal helped ensure the national parks would remain protected places. In 1975 he took his message to the White House, gifting President Gerald Ford with a print of Yosemite. “Now, Mr President, every time you look at this picture,” he urged, “I want you to remember your obligation to the national parks.” National parks in peril Today those parks remain cherished but also in peril, caught between the pressures of extreme weather and surging tourism. Photography that spurred appreciation for the wilderness has also helped flood these areas with footsteps. Growing crowds and tourist-catering amenities are increasingly at odds with conservation efforts as parks push past their capacity. Adams saw the problems unfolding even in his time and often resisted what he called “resortism” in the parks and their development for public use. In his images he typically erases signs of people to offer a more pristine view of the landscapes. “We see Ansel Adams photographs and we don’t see them peopled,” Mackay said. “He is in some instances removing them from his photographs.” Yosemite – one of the most visited parks in the nation – is a quintessential example of the difficult balancing act between enabling access and ensuring the lands are preserved for generations to come. The past year has put the extreme seasonal swings that Yosemite faces on full display. In summer the park was shrouded in smoke from nearby wildfires, followed by a winter of snowstorms that closed down the park for weeks and damaged the winding mountain roads leading into the valley. The curators feel strongly that Adams would have had a perspective to share about how these issues have unfolded. That’s why, they said, including new artistic voices has elevated the potential for impact. “It’s bleak realizing how little has changed and how much work we still have to do,” said Haas reflecting on the enormous scale of problems posed by a warming world. But, she added, the exhibit has brought her hope, with its potential to both inspire awe and action. It’s a feeling she hopes viewers share. “With this exhibition we can finally put this great master in conversation,” she said, “and let these contemporary figures show us the concerns that continue today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-02T12:30:13Z","webTitle":"The staying power of ‘King Bibi’, Israel’s scandal-ridden political behemoth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/02/netanyahu-poised-to-reassume-power-with-help-from-far-right-friends","fields":{"bodyText":"Don’t call it a comeback. Benjamin Netanyahu was booted from office last summer by a broad coalition united by their distaste for the conservative Likud leader. But after Tuesday’s election – an unprecedented fifth poll in less than four years – the short-lived “government of change” is probably going to prove no more than a brief intermission in the political behemoth’s long career. With 80% of votes counted on Wednesday, but official results not due until next week, Bibi, as he is commonly known, appears the most likely candidate to form a new government. Several small leftwing parties may yet clear the electoral threshold, erasing his rightwing religious bloc’s lead of 65 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. But even if that happens, Netanyahu still would not be out of the running. Coalition horse-trading could last for weeks, and if it failed, a sixth election would be held next year. Israel’s political crisis since 2019 was triggered by allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against Netanyahu, whose last stint as prime minister lasted 12 years. He has denied all the charges in his ongoing corruption trial, but the case has polarised Israeli society. To his ardent supporters, “King Bibi” is a strong, tested leader unfairly prosecuted by a biased establishment. To detractors, his vilification of the judicial system has undermined trust in public institutions and the rule of law, paving the way for the astonishing rise of his new far-right ally, the Religious Zionist party, which doubled its number of seats. Many from across the political spectrum had hoped that the 73-year-old would eventually stop standing for the good of the politically fractured country. But it was never likely he would give up. Netanyahu’s probable success is mostly thanks to the Religious Zionists, formerly three fringe extremist parties that he persuaded to merge into one slate before the 2021 election. In doing so, he may have opened Pandora’s box. This time round, its radical ideas – expelling “disloyal” Palestinian citizens of Israel and annexing the occupied West Bank – have been greeted with enthusiasm from an increasingly rightwing Israeli public. The former prime minister insists it is nothing to do with him that his new ally has proposed sweeping changes to the penal code that would help get his trial thrown out. “Over his previous two stints in office, Bibi has preferred to form coalitions with centrist or centre-left parties, but he’s made too many enemies and broken too many promises for that to happen again now,” said Eran Amsalem, an assistant professor of communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “He’s stuck with the far right, whether he likes it or not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T18:26:30Z","webTitle":"Russian assault on Ukraine’s power grid is the strategy of nihilism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/31/russia-assault-on-ukraine-power-grid-is-strategy-of-nihilism","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia’s cynical decision to target Ukraine’s network of hydroelectric power stations on Monday represents a further, dispiriting, escalation in its efforts to destroy the country’s power supply. The electricity network is reeling from three weeks of attacks focused on coal- and gas-fired power stations and, above all, the electricity substations that link up different parts of the grid. Power cuts are the new normal as winter looms. It may not be clear how damaging Monday’s attacks involving the two hydro plants on the Dnieper River and a third on the western Dniester are, but their targeting suggests Russia intends to push further in its attempts bomb Ukraine into darkness: before the war, hydro contributed about 14% of the country’s energy capacity. At the same time, Ukraine has warned that Russia has mined the Nova Kakhovka dam in the occupied south of the country and that its retreating forces may yet destroy it to cover a retreat from Kherson. Moscow has warned that Ukraine may blow up the dam across the Dnieper River, although some pro-Russian bloggers published animated maps to show how serious the disruption could be downriver. It is almost certain that Monday’s attacks will be followed up, and for all Ukraine’s claimed success in knocking out 44 out of 50 incoming missiles, the reality remains that a minority continue to get through to damage strategically vital targets. Cutting electricity supplies may have some impact on Ukraine’s military, which has a battlefield momentum that the Kremlin is desperate to halt, but it is obvious that the most serious consequences will be faced by civilians at risk of being without electricity and other utilities in a country where winter temperatures can plunge to -20C. John Lough, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, warns that “this has the potential to be very painful for the civilian population” but that it is likely “to encourage Ukrainians to dig in more and accept that Russia has chosen to victimise them and inflict the maximum pain possible”. Bombing, however terrifying, is a military tactic that has a poor record of changing hearts and minds. It was used heavily in the Vietnam war, for instance, but failed to stem the overall resolve of the North Vietnamese, and if the Russians are any students of history, they will know its limitations. But Russia probably does not care. Its strategy is also aimed at the west: a shameless attempt to prompt a fresh flow of several million migrants across the border. Ukraine has been trying to ask refugees already abroad not to return this winter to help protect the energy supply. “The networks will not cope,” said the deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, last week. At the same time, Russia hopes to increase the costs of supporting Ukraine, which imported energy from Europe on a test basis for the first time last week. Historically, Ukraine has enjoyed an energy surplus. Now it may need to buy supplies at a time when its treasury is short due to the demands of fighting Russia. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently estimated that Ukraine needs to borrow between $3bn and $4bn (£2.6bn and £3.5bn) a month to get through next year, but warned that Kyiv’s need for financial support could rise further if “social and infrastructure requirements” increase – in other words if the war damage worsens in a war that is likely to last into next year at least. Ukraine and its allies have to be braced for the longer haul, and be ready to focus on further humanitarian support, mindful of the fact that the Kremlin has embraced nihilism as its primary method of warfare. Or as Lough puts it: “If Putin can’t take Ukraine, he’ll wreck it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T17:35:06Z","webTitle":"EDF considers extending life of two UK nuclear plants due to energy crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/28/edf-considers-extending-life-of-two-uk-nuclear-plants-due-to-energy-crisis-hartlepool-heysham","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s EDF is considering extending the life of two British nuclear power plants due to the severity of the energy crisis. EDF said on Wednesday that it would review whether there was a case to keep open the Hartlepool nuclear power plant in County Durham and Heysham 1 on the north-west coast of England near Lancaster. Both plants had been scheduled to close in March 2024. EDF operates all of Britain’s eight nuclear power plants, five of which are still providing power to the grid, about 13% of the UK’s electricity. The entire fleet is due to shut by 2028 apart from Sizewell B, which will close in 2035. When EDF took over the nuclear fleet in 2009, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool were due to run until 2014. After technical reviews, that was extended to 2019 and then, in 2016, a further five-year extension was approved after further reviews. Sources said any extra lifespan for the stations was likely to be far shorter than previous extensions. The stations – which produce 2.2 gigawatts of power, enough to power 3.5m homes – have been operational for four decades. EDF said it had decided to launch the review “in light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections” and said an extension would “depend on the results of graphite inspections over the coming months”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked turmoil in energy markets and sent gas and electricity prices soaring. It has also caused an international dash for gas supplies and raised concerns over potential blackouts this winter. The government has moved to shore up winter energy supplies, signing deals to keep coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire and the east Midlands on standby including EDF’s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire. Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect union, said: “The government has had no option but to keep these plants on longer term. It underlines that we need a long-term plan for energy generation. We’re a decade late on nuclear and if we don’t move fast enough we will miss the boat on other fuels, like hydrogen. The government needs to give people the confidence to invest.” Some power-generation companies, including those on nuclear, old solar and windfarm contracts have landed an unexpected windfall from the jump in electricity prices while their costs have not risen, triggering calls for a windfall tax. EDF said its nuclear fleet would generate 42 terawatt hours of power in 2022. It said that, because it had sold its output in advance, it had delivered at “well below current wholesale prices”. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Centrica, which owns a 20% stake in the nuclear fleet alongside EDF, wants to renegotiate its electricity-generation contracts. Tom Burke, co-founder of the green thinktank E3G, said: “In the current climate it makes a lot of sense [to extend the plants’ lifespans]. The question is mainly about the cost: is the extra time you’re buying worth the cost of keeping it safe? The Office for Nuclear Regulation are not going to play fast and loose with safety so then it depends on the spend. With electricity prices where they are now it probably does make sense.” EDF said it plans to invest £1bn in the nuclear fleet from 2023 to 2025. The debt-laden company, which is being fully nationalised by the French government, is developing the delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C project in Somerset. It is also behind plans for a sister station, Sizewell C, in Suffolk, which was given the green light in the final days of Boris Johnson’s premiership. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Getting the most out of our existing nuclear stations is vital to ensuring Britain has a secure supply of power going forward.” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, on Tuesday pledged to launch Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, if elected."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T01:01:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 165 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-165-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after it was hit by shelling, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said he was “extremely concerned” by reports of damage as Zelenskiy accused Russia of using the plant “for terror”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, according to British intelligence. “The heaviest fighting [will shift] to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper river,” the UK Ministry of Defence said. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the buildup is not yet clear, UK intelligence warned. The Ministry of Defence said Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply in Ukraine’s southern regions, the ministry added. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started in February, to be loaded with grain. The Ukrainian infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the Barbados-flagged general cargo ship Fulmar S was in the Ukrainian port of Chornomorsk and Ukraine planned to “reach the level of at least three to five vessels per day in two weeks’ [time]”. Horrific video and photos appear to show a fresh atrocity with remains of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. “There is nothing human about the Russians. We are at war with non-humans,” said the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death inside a Russian detention centre outside Donetsk, while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, a former prisoner has said. Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur, was trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Mariupol when she was arrested and held on charges of “terrorism”. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency has said. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A Russian journalist has reportedly been arrested at the border on suspicion that she could be a spy, Kosovo’s interior minister said on Saturday. Xhelal Svecla named the journalist as Daria Aslamova. “Many countries have proven that she was engaged in espionage for Russian military intelligence and that she pretended to be a journalist,” Svecla said. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Kherson was gravely wounded on Saturday in an attempted assassination, local Moscow-backed officials said. Vitaly Gur “is in hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, in a critical state”, an unnamed official told Russian state news agency Tass. Meta, formerly named Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed after the report found that about $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-06T15:59:17Z","webTitle":"How important is Horizon science project for UK – and could it rejoin?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/jul/06/how-important-is-horizon-science-project-for-uk-and-could-it-rejoin","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK is edging closer to a deal to allow it back into the flagship £85bn Horizon Europe science research programme after being locked out since 2020 in a row over Northern Ireland’s Brexit trading arrangements. What might happen, and can British science recover its leading position in Europe? Was there any point to the row? Debatable. Scientists had nothing to do with the Northern Ireland protocol and the issue had little political capital. Arguably, the only losers were in the sector itself. Is it over? Not yet. The UK is close to a deal, sources say, speculating that there could be an announcement on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, next Tuesday. What does the UK say? Downing Street said a deal had not been agreed between the UK and the EU on the Horizon Europe research programme. Rishi Sunak’s official spokesperson said the prime minister was keen to seek “value for money for taxpayers” if the UK was to rejoin the scheme, with “constructive” discussions still going on. “It doesn’t affect just the past two years, but also the future value that the UK will get from these programmes, and the UK would be a net contributor to the Horizon programme if the decision were made to take that approach. So obviously there are issues that we are discussing and that we continue to discuss with the EU, and we will consider next steps.” The EU also says negotiations are continuing. What is the issue? Money. The government is concerned that confidence is so weakened in the science sector that the money it pays in will not be matched by awards and it will end up being a net loser. What do scientists say? They agree that confidence has taken a knock, but say there is no reason why applications to the fund will not recover with the UK taking a leading role in the programme once again. Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said returning to the programme would be “a huge relief”. Can the loss be quantified? EU data shows that in 2019, €959.3m went to the UK in 1,364 grants, compared with €22.18m in 192 grants in 2023 to date. How important was that money? There is nothing that matched the scale of Horizon 2020 for scientific research and innovation. The programme had €100bn (£85bn) to fund projects from 2021 to 2027. These aim to tackle many of the most pressing questions the world faces, from dealing with climate change and protecting the oceans to fighting terminal diseases and improving food and energy security. Britain has historically received far more back than it has contributed to EU research programmes. Between 2007 and 2013, the UK contributed nearly £4.3bn towards EU research projects and received nearly £7bn in grants. The £2.7bn excess amounted to more than £300m in research funds each year. A major report in 2016 found that pre-Brexit, scientific and medical research in the UK was substantially propped up by EU grants, with crucial work on cancer, computing, nanotechnology and engineering all heavily reliant on the funds. European grants made up more than 40% of public money poured into cancer research and 62% of public money spent on nanotechnology research, the report found. Only 7% of funds from the EU and the European Research Council went to non-member states from 2006 to 2015. But could the UK not just fund its own scientists? It does. The UK Research and Innovation government fund guarantees that it will back scientists who would otherwise have relied on Horizon grants. But the science community argues it is not the same as international collaboration, and the sharing of findings is vital to accelerate advances. So what has happened in the past three years? A protracted political sulk rather than an official dispute after Lord Frost’s decision to unilaterally abandon some of the trading arrangements (since removed under the Windsor framework) relating to Northern Ireland. Associate membership, due by normal standards in spring or early summer of 2021, was never ratified by the EU. It was simply delayed in an informal retaliatory measure taken over the UK’s failure to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU never announced that it was withholding membership, and it wasn’t until May 2022 that a senior EU diplomat admitted that Horizon Europe “might be the victim of a political impasse”. Talks were only reopened in March 2023, when Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen agreed the new Windsor framework for Northern Ireland. Is particular research at risk? Doubts have been raised over whether the UK will seek access to Euratom, a parallel funding scheme for nuclear research and innovation, amid concerns that ministers do not consider Horizon good value for money. The programme operates on the same rules as Horizon Europe and aims to spend €1.4bn (£1.2bn) from 2021 to 2025. The funds will drive projects on nuclear fission, safety and radiation protection, but much of the investment is aimed at nuclear fusion, a potentially gamechanging source of green power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T14:00:18Z","webTitle":"Wrath and awe: a short history of balloons and their power to fire up mob fury | Jeff Sparrow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/feb/15/wrath-and-awe-a-short-history-of-balloons-and-their-power-to-fire-up-mob-fury","fields":{"bodyText":"On 16 December 1784 – barely a year after the first crewed flight – a British cartoonist published a sketch entitled The Battle of the Balloons, depicting airships belonging to the leading powers of the day firing cannons at each other from among the clouds. In his book Falling Upwards, Richard Holmes adduces the drawing as evidence of the intimate relationship between balloons and military competition, with, for instance, the first French company of aeronauts formed on the remarkably early date of 29 March 1794. Today we might contemplate another point Holmes makes: “Balloons are also ancient and symbolic devices [with] a long history, and a longer mythology, going back in various forms and dimensions thousands of years, to ancient civilisations in South America and China.” Perhaps that long symbolic resonance explains something about the otherwise baffling battle of balloons raging in our 21st century skies. US defence personnel now say they have downed four mysterious objects floating across America and Canada over the last week. A spokesperson for the state department blamed China for flying balloons over “more than 40 countries across five continents”; China’s foreign ministry countered by claiming to to have detected 10 US balloons in its airspace since January 2022. The US and China both control hundreds of spy satellites. These high-tech surveillance systems suck up communications data at whim, generate images so precise as to reveal details of clothing, cracks in the pavement and rubbish on the ground, and classify information in real time using the latest iterations of AI. Once launched, they’re almost impossible to circumvent – and so, for the most part, both sides respond to constant orbital scrutiny by pretending (at least publicly) that it doesn’t exist. Why, then, the sudden concern about a technology developed in the 18th century? In 1783 the Montgolfier brothers launched a balloon emblazoned with the cipher of Louis XVI, carrying skyward a sheep, duck and a cockerel (all three later hailed as “heroes of the air”) before a huge crowd at the Palace of Versailles. The display might not have saved Louis from the guillotine a few years later but it established a relationship between lighter-than-air flight and state power, reinforced when Napoleon celebrated his coronation by sending aloft a silk-draped balloon carrying a huge imperial crown on golden chains. Yet shortly after the Montgolfier demonstration, Prof Jacques Charles and the brothers Anne-Jean and Nicolas-Louis Robert launched the first hydrogen balloon in central Paris. It landed in the village of Gonesse – where the peasants destroyed it with pitchforks. If balloons could awe the masses, they could also, it seemed, enrage them. On 18 December 1856 Sydney newspapers advertised that a certain Pierre Maigre, “of aerial fame in France, US, East Indies, Mauritius and other places”, intended to “climb to the heavens” in what would be Australia’s first balloon flight. But when Maigre attempted to inflate his craft before a huge crowd of paying spectators on the Domain, the slowness of the process so bored the onlookers that, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, some “four thousand boys and youths, with yells and hootings, [went] flying after the unfortunate aeronaut, who, however, succeeded in making his escape, not exactly in so trim a guise as that in which he had appeared in public”. The crowd then began chanting, “The balloon! The balloon! Burn the balloon,” a task they soon accomplished. The Domain balloon riot (a “scene of wanton mischief such as we never wish to behold again”, the SMH said), delayed the first successful Australian flight until February 1858, when George Coppin engaged Joseph Dean and Charles Henry Brown to launch a balloon in Cremorne in Melbourne. Only two weeks later, when Brown attempted a second flight, he reported how when he descended “on the road between Collingwood stockade and Brunswick”, he was “treated in the most brutal manner by the people ascended … they tore the hair from my head, bruised, pushed and almost suffocated me, besides damaging the balloon by tugging at trampling on it”. In 1864 the famed aeronaut Henry Coxwell received even rougher treatment in Leicester, England, when rumours spread among the 50,000 spectators watching his ascent that he was palming them off with an older, smaller balloon. The crowd turned on Coxwell and, when he abandoned the flight, attacked him, chanting, according to one newspaper, “Rip him up,” “Knock him on the head” and “Finish him.” Once again the balloon was burnt, with its remains paraded triumphantly through the town. The hostility sometimes shown to Victorian aeronauts clearly stemmed from the class polarisations of the era. But the balloons themselves made tempting targets for popular wrath because of the way they combined the sublime and the profane. They soared high above ordinary men and women and yet could be so easily reduced to their flimsy, prosaic components. Perhaps there’s something similar in the current crisis. The most important spy technology remains, by its nature, almost entirely invisible. Yet, unlike a satellite, the first balloon shot down by the Americans could be seen by the naked eye – and as such provided a public, palpable focus for the tensions between the US and China. Once it became visible, escalation seemed inevitable. Holmes says ballooning enables “the most enduring early dream of flying”, which he describes as fundamentally metaphysical. “The ultimate purpose is,” he says, “to fly as high as possible, and then look back upon the earth and see mankind for what it really is.” In that spirit, what does the balloon crisis reveal? Fairly obviously, it shows that polarisation between the superpowers has reached such a level of tension that confrontations could break out over issues that no one saw coming. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-31T16:28:05Z","webTitle":"Niger coup leaders accuse France of plotting military intervention","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/31/niger-coup-leaders-accuse-france-plotting-military-intervention","fields":{"bodyText":"The military junta that seized power in Niger has accused France of plotting military intervention to reinstate the deposed president, Mohamed Bazoum, as tensions in the region continued to grow in the wake of the coup. The junta said on national TV that France was searching “for ways and means to intervene militarily in Niger” and had held a meeting with the chief of staff of Niger’s national guard “to obtain the necessary political and military authorisation”. The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, denied any alleged intention of military intervention in the west African country. “It’s wrong,” she told BFMTV news channel on Monday night, adding that it was still possible to return Niger’s democratically elected president to power. “And it’s necessary because destabilisation is perilous for Niger and its neighbours,” she said. Bazoum, an ally of western powers, was toppled on 26 July in a coup by Niger’s elite presidential guard. Gen Abdourahamane Tchiani declared himself leader but his claim has been shunned internationally. On Monday, Bazoum’s party said several ministers in his ousted government had been arrested, including the mines minister. Niger is the world’s seventh-biggest producer of uranium, the radioactive metal widely used for nuclear energy and treating cancer. The Chadian president, Mahamat Idriss Déby, who flew to Niger to try to mediate, on Monday posted what appeared to be the first images of Bazoum since the takeover, showing him smiling and apparently unharmed. Déby said he had met Bazoum and coup leader Tchiani to explore ways “to find a peaceful solution”, without going into further detail. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has given the junta a week to give back power, warning in a statement that if Bazoum was not reinstated it would take “all measures” to restore constitutional order, which “may include the use of force”. ECOWAS has suspended all commercial and financial transactions, while France, the EU and the US, which has about 1,000 troops in Niger, have either cut off support or threatened to do so. Germany suspended financial aid and development cooperation, and UN humanitarian operations have been put on hold. Russia called for the swift return of “the rule of law” and “restraint from all parties so that this doesn’t result in human casualties”. Niger, with a population of 26 million, frequently ranks at the bottom of the UN’s human development index benchmark of prosperity. The country, which became independent from France in 1960, is a landlocked state, and strict economic sanctions against it could affect many supplies, including electricity. The coup, according to the putschists, was a response to “the degradation of the security situation” linked to the jihadist conflict, as well as corruption and economic difficulties. As Niger struggles with two jihadist campaigns – one in the south-west, which swept in from Mali in 2015, and the other in the south-east, involving jihadists from north-eastern Nigeria – the coup has shone a spotlight on France’s reduced and contested military presence in the Sahel region of Africa after 10 years fighting jihadist insurgencies. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, chose unusually strong language towards the junta in Niger, vowing there would be “immediate and uncompromising” action if French citizens or interests were attacked, after thousands rallied outside the French embassy. News agencies reported anti-French and pro-Russian slogans were shouted at the rallies on Sunday, which were televised. Protesters, some carrying Russian flags, said France, the country’s traditional ally, had failed to shield them against the jihadists, whereas Russia would be a stronger ally. The coup is a serious threat to French strategy in the Sahel, after several military coups in other countries had already forced France to rethink its decade-long military presence and anti-jihadist mission. France first deployed troops against jihadists in Mali in 2013 under the Socialist president François Hollande, but in the past three years several military coups in the region, as well as a continued jihadist presence, have exposed the limitations of the military strategy and forced France to scale back its presence and focus its efforts in Niger, with Bazoum as a firm ally. It has 1,500 troops in the country and an airbase near Niamey. In Mali a coup in 2020 led to a diplomatic standoff with France, which withdrew its troops last year. France also quit Burkina Faso after two coups last year brought in a junta that adopted a nationalist line. Niagalé Bagayoko, a political scientist and defence expert, told France Inter radio that the G5 Sahel group of nations set up to combat jihadist insurgency now featured a majority of military juntas. She said France could not continue its military engagement in Niger under the current circumstances, adding that France had been rethinking its presence in the region for more than two years. She said foreign troops, including the US and other Europeans as well as the French, were seen as unpopular and people wanted their withdrawal. The writer and analyst Seidik Abba told France Inter that the broader problem for Paris was that the poor results of its military and security drive against jihadists had made France a scapegoat. He said the strategy in the Sahel had been a security and military one, when in fact “it wasn’t just a security and military issue, it was also a question of development, justice and governance”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-17T20:40:43Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: police investigate violent arrest; Aukus fight in Labor ranks; Indigenous Vietnam veterans identified","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/aug/18/morning-mail-police-investigate-violent-arrest-aukus-fight-in-labor-ranks-indigenous-vietnam-veterans-identified","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning.

Despite bowing out in the World Cup semi-finals to England, football fever has spread across the nation and sparked hope that this tournament is just the beginning of a bright future for women’s sport. Gabrielle Jackson speaks to Mike Ticher and Mike Hytner about how Australia must capitalise on the Matildas’ World Cup success. In-depth The Coalition appears to have landed on a neat solution to decarbonising Australia’s electricity grid – just swap out the coal plants for nuclear. The shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, says such a plan would reduce the need to spend billions on connecting solar and windfarms to the grid. But what O’Brien has failed to mention is the cost of a new plant to build – and that the pace at which you could deploy the small modular reactors he advocates means sitting on our hands until at least the end of the decade.

He was a socialist radical thinker and, although also recognising his duty to his congregations, in the 198os in Dover he walked and picketed with striking miners. Born and brought up on a council estate in Acocks Green in Birmingham, Alan was the sixth of 10 children of Frank, a bricklayer, and Beatrice (nee Edgington). He attended Severne Road nursery, infant and junior schools and Pitmaston boys’ school before gaining a place at Bordesley Green technical school in the city in 1954. He was a keen football fan – an Aston Villa supporter – and played in goal for the Bordesley Green school team, winning the league and the cup in the south Birmingham schools fixtures. On leaving school in 1957 he trained as a structural engineer in Birmingham. His interests, however, were set on church ministry with the Methodist foundation, and in 1962 he was awarded a scholarship to Richmond Theological College, University of London, where he gained a diploma in theology in 1966. In the same year he married Sheila Meredith, also from Birmingham – they went on to have two sons, Paul (known as Kingsley) and Conrad. Together, Alan and Sheila boarded the SS Groote Beer in Rotterdam, sailing to New York then travelling on to the Christian theological seminary in Indianapolis, where Alan gained his master’s degree in 1967. Before he returned to Britain he took the opportunity to use Greyhound bus services to see more of the US, and especially to visit the grave in Taos, New Mexico, of his favourite author, DH Lawrence. Alan’s ministry began in Redcar in North Yorkshire in 1967, followed by a posting to Brixton, London in 1970. In Meanwood, Leeds, he took a doctorate in ministry between 1974 and 1982. He then worked in Dover (1982-85), County Durham (1986-94) and Manchester (1994-97). His final posting was to Stockton on Tees, from 1998 to 2005. He retired to Northallerton in Yorkshire that year. In 2020, Alan and Sheila moved to Darlington to live with Conrad.

After all, she said: “I’ve lived through hurricanes in Miami and south Florida, including Hurricane Andrew, which left my house and a handful of others standing in my neighborhood, so I felt we would be all right.” And they were until a huge oak tree fell through the roof and ceiling of her mother’s bedroom while her mother was in bed. “It nearly scared me to death when I heard this horrible crashing sound,” Poitier recounted, retracing her path from the living room to her mother’s bedroom. “I opened my mother’s bedroom door and saw my mother lying in bed with a fallen tree hanging over her.” Idalia has passed now, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars of damage and lives and homes that now need to be rebuilt. Poitier’s mother was shaken but physically unhurt, even though the tree limbs were hanging low enough to touch. “I think the whole thing scared me more than it scared her,” Poitier said. The category 3 storm made landfall on the coast of Taylor county near the community of Keaton Beach then cut an inland path through towns like Perry before heading back out into the Atlantic and up the eastern coast of Georgia and the Carolinas. Ahead of the hurricane, the Taylor county sheriff, Wayne Padgett, and the county’s emergency management department had issued mandatory evacuations of coastal county communities, including Steinhatchee, Keaton Beach and Dekle Beach. People living in mobile homes, campers and substandard housing were also ordered to evacuate. However, when the county decided to close its hurricane shelter at a local elementary school in Perry and transport people to shelters in Tallahassee, residents, like Sylvester Bellamy, knew the storm was going to be catastrophic. Bellamy, a Perry native, heeded the hurricane warnings and decided to evacuate with his family to Valdosta, Georgia. “Unfortunately, the hurricane’s path shifted, and we ended up evacuating into the hurricane’s path after it left Taylor county,” Bellamy said. “So, we had to wait for the hurricane to pass before we could come home and check on things.” Sitting in Valdosta through the hurricane, by then downgraded slightly to category 2, was extremely difficult for Bellamy because he had received word from home that his small vegetable stand on US Highway 19, where he often hangs out with family and friends, was severely damaged in the hurricane. “I’m just getting back to Perry,” Bellamy said. When asked if there was any damage to his home, he responded, “I haven’t been there yet. This was my first stop. I knew it was damaged, but I didn’t expect this,” he said. The entire front and part of the roof were torn off the building. “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” he said as he choked back tears. “I can even remember buying cookies and candy here when I was a boy, way before my daddy bought it. But I guess all I can do now is clean it up.” He walked back and forth, occasionally finding a memory in the rubble and a reason to smile. “I better go check on the house,” he said. “Without any power, it’s going to be really dark around here.” The darkness brought a glimmer of hope when the red lights began to flash at one of the town’s busiest intersections. “Thank God,” Poitier shouted when she saw the red lights turn green. “They’re working on the electricity.” Her excitement was short-lived after her companion asked: “You don’t hear those generators?” “The traffic light is on,” Poitier responded. “How doesn’t matter right now.” Before the night ended, several traffic lights in the town were back in operation – though all were powered by generators."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-18T17:07:36Z","webTitle":"Sudan: which powers are vying for influence in vast east African country?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/18/sudan-which-powers-are-vying-for-influence-in-vast-east-african-country","fields":{"bodyText":"The conflict in Sudan is an internal power struggle, with its roots in the country’s troubled politics over recent decades. Four days of fighting has pitted army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of Sudan’s transitional governing sovereign council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who is deputy head of the council. Their power struggle has derailed a shift to civilian rule and raised fears of a wider conflict. At the same time, a dozen or more regional powers, major actors in the Middle East and geo-political heavyweights have a stake in the fighting raging in Khartoum and elsewhere. The United States, which is the biggest actor, is able to exert influence directly on key individuals, through the withholding or delivery of huge sums of aid, its weight in international forums such as the United Nations or multilateral lenders, and its ability to build coalitions of smaller powers. The US wants stability in a restive region of enormous strategic importance, and also to roll back the growing influence of competitors such as China and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. Washington welcomed the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but has been criticised for taking too soft a line with the two main military powerbrokers and particularly with Burhan. China has been making a major effort to win friends in east Africa through the construction of major infrastructure, economic investment, loans and support for incumbent rulers who are attracted to its brand of authoritarianism. But although China has ambitions to establish a role as a mediator of consequence across the continent, it is unlikely to have much influence on this conflict. This relative neutrality at least offers Beijing a potential opportunity to build a relationship with any eventual victor. In contrast, Russia is seen as being fully committed to Hemedti and the RSF. The former warlord has been linked to Russian efforts to extract huge amounts of gold from Sudan to help fund the invasion of Ukraine, and Moscow has deployed Wagner group paramilitaries to bolster Hemedti’s operations. Beyond the precious resources, it is Sudan’s strategic position that has attracted Moscow, particularly the chance to position a major naval base there, which would allow operations in the Indian Ocean. Egypt has longstanding ties with Sudan’s military and has made its support for Burhan clear. Egyptian soldiers – or “trainers” – have been taken captive by the RSF in recent days. Cairo wants stability and likes the idea of an authoritarian military man in charge of its vast neighbour. But it also wants the support of Khartoum in its bitter argument with Ethiopia over the control of the flow of the Nile. The Egyptians also want to check the influence of their regional rivals in Sudan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also major actors, and their rulers have personal relationships with many of the key figures in Sudan. Both have poured huge sums of money into Sudan since 2019 in an attempt to build a regime favourable to their interests. Hemedti won favour by dispatching thousands of Sudanese fighters to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition there, but Burhan has been welcomed too. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have become much more aligned with western policy in Sudan in recent years. In recent weeks, Riyadh in particular has been active in trying to avert conflict – though without much success, it appears. The European Union is aligned with the US and the United Kingdom in seeking a compromise agreement that would lead to a transition to civilian control. Chaos in Sudan could trigger a new increase in refugees, and France is particularly concerned about the consequences for fragile states farther west where it has already lost much influence in recent years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-23T23:31:17Z","webTitle":"Solar and windfarm investment is drying up – and Australia needs a wake-up call on the future of the electricity grid | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/24/solar-and-windfarm-investment-is-drying-up-and-australia-needs-a-wake-up-call-on-the-future-of-the-electricity-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"This week should be a wake-up call on the future of the electricity grid, but we seem in danger of collectively drawing the wrong conclusions about which way to go. The main problem is straightforward – investment in large-scale solar and windfarms has dried up to next-to-nothing just as it is supposed to be moving into overdrive. According to a report by the Clean Energy Council on Wednesday, in the three months to the end of June investors made financial commitments on only four renewable energy projects. And these projects are not particularly big, adding up to just 348 megawatts of new capacity – a fraction of one coal power plant. This is not a one-off. The first three months of the year were even worse. It’s the slowest start to a year since the council started recording this data in 2017. This has obvious ramifications, including putting targets for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction in doubt, if not out of reach. It also increases the risk of the electricity grid failing unless decisive steps are taken to address the slump. At the moment, there is little sign that is happening. If anything, the focus is in the opposite direction. In New South Wales, the Sydney Morning Herald has reported that a “reality check” commissioned by the Minns Labor government advised it to negotiate with the owner of Eraring, Australia’s largest coal plant, to extend its life beyond its planned closure date in two years. By any measure, this is a ridiculous situation for the state to find itself in. Eraring is 40 years old, ready for decommissioning, and it is expected it will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayers’ dollars to prop it up a little longer. A broadly similar scenario is playing out in Victoria. In 2021, the Andrews government made a deal to keep the Yallourn brown coal generator open until 2028. This week it announced an agreement to ensure another plant, Loy Yang A, remains available until mid-2035. These deals will cost taxpayers an undisclosed, but presumably substantial, sum. There is an argument that these decisions are now unavoidable. We obviously can’t shut coal plants before replacement generation is ready, and it’s possible some generators should be kept on the books to be switched on only if needed. In Victoria’s case, it’s at least tied to a goal of 95% renewable energy – and, therefore, no coal – by 2035. But it’s notable how much political and media discussion is focused on the risks of moving past coal, and not the solutions that can speed up an inevitable transformation needed to address the climate crisis. The idea that renewable energy is not up to doing the job persists no matter what the evidence says, or how often it’s presented. No one is building new coal power plants in Australia, and most recent problems in the grid were caused by outages at old coal units, not solar or windfarms. The risk of that repeating grows the longer they run. As challenging as the rollout is, we have the technology to replace them more rapidly. The move to clean energy is faltering due to governments and public agencies, not because the machinery can’t do the job. The biggest government failure has been well documented. For nearly a decade, the federal Coalition tried to slow or block the shift away from fossil fuels, and made any serious climate policy political poison. It deserves much of the blame for the disorderly transition happening now. But there are other deeply ingrained problems. They include the idea that the market will drive the shift to a renewables-dominated system just because solar and wind energy generation is cheaper than fossil fuels. Labor came to power attached to this thinking. It was backed by a report by the consultants RepuTex that suggested the country would reach 82% renewable energy by 2030 if the government offered $20bn in low-cost finance for the private sector to build electricity transmission lines. We now have evidence that this isn’t going to be enough. The scale of what’s being attempted is massive – a near complete rebuild of the power grid. Just as the existing grid was mostly built and managed by governments before being privatised, the rebuild will need clearer direction from the top to succeed. The only credible option that can rapidly cut emissions is a system that runs on solar and wind plus back-up – batteries, inter-regional transmission, pumped hydro and, initially at least, some fast-start gas plants. Despite what the Coalition and its backers claim, there is plenty of evidence this mix can provide what is needed, and there are no available or affordable alternatives. The Albanese government and most states have started down the renewables-plus-firming path to varying degrees, but it’s a messy picture. What’s missing is a policy that acknowledges that the energy transition is a race – to meet science-based climate targets and ensure there is enough new generation to replace coal plants ASAP, but also to win an increasingly competitive battle for global clean industry investment. Last year’s US Inflation Reduction Act kicked that into overdrive. What’s needed, badly, is something that drags large-scale renewable energy into the system faster. Options could include a revamped renewable energy target, an expanded safeguard mechanism that effectively puts a carbon price on coal energy, and a front-loaded underwriting program. It would need to run alongside a plan to streamline the construction of transmissions links, including an evolving assessment of where they should and shouldn’t be built, factoring in cost blowouts and local concerns. A more concerted effort to improve energy efficiency to cut how much grid electricity we use and limit power bill increases wouldn’t hurt, either. The climate and economic benefits would be significant. They could include avoiding having to spend wads of cash propping up a dying, polluting industry – a step that, presumably, everyone can get behind. • Adam Morton is Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-15T20:45:37Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Putin meets Xi, asylum seeker handcuffs ‘torture’, nuclear sub timeline","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/16/morning-mail-putin-meets-xi-asylum-seeker-handcuffs-torture-nuclear-sub-timeline","fields":{"bodyText":"Good morning – Vladimir Putin has hinted at tensions between Russia and China over Ukraine. There’s a near-8km queue of Queen mourners (or are they?) in London – but in Australia, the Country Women’s Association is thinking of dropping the monarchy, and God, from its motto. The United Nations’ torture prevention watchdog has been urged to investigate Australia’s use of handcuffs on asylum seekers when seeking medical care – a practice advocates condemn as inhumane and unlawful. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac) has requested the UN’s subcommittee on the prevention of torture investigate the practice during its visit next month – it is expected to scrutinise Australia’s immigration detention network. Vladimir Putin has publicly referred to China’s “questions and concerns” about the war in Ukraine, in a rare nod to tensions between the two states caused by the Russian invasion.

As counting ended on Saturday night, Labor had picked up at least nine seats, enough to govern in majority and a better-than-expected result for the party after big swings in many previously safe Coalition seats. The result means Minns will become the first Labor leader to win government from opposition in NSW for almost three decades and sees the Coalition relegated to the opposition benches in every parliament on mainland Australia. The election had been fought by Labor on a few key issues including a promise to end the sale of public assets, removing the controversial public sector wages cap and for investments in health and education. In a late-night speech delivered to a packed room of party faithful in a function room in the beachside suburb of Brighton-Le-Sands, in Minns’ seat of Kogarah in Sydney’s south, he said the election was “a decisive vote against privatisation”. “We know the challenges are huge, the responsibilities are awesome but NSW Labor is back and ready to govern in this great state of NSW,” he said. “We started effectively two years ago with a promise to the people of NSW that we would run an election campaign asking people to vote a positive vote for NSW Labor and not just a negative vote against the government. “I’m proud to say today the people of NSW voted for the removal of the unfair wages cap. They voted for our nurses, our teachers … our paramedics and police.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup For the Coalition, the result marks a devastating blow. Dominic Perrottet had sought to reset the government after becoming premier in late 2021 after former premier Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation, and won plaudits for his push to reform poker machines in the state. But the baggage of 12 years in government proved too much to overcome. Speaking on Saturday night, former Liberal prime minister John Howard paid tribute to Perrottet for running an “heroic” campaign. “He put forward ideas. He was bold,” Howard said, saying the outgoing premier’s stance on problem gambling – something he called a “social evil” – was “admirable”. In his concession speech, Perrottet announced he would stand down as the state’s Liberal party leader while hailing the three-term Coalition government’s record. “It is a time to reflect. It is a time to rethink and ultimately to renew. To renew as leader of the parliamentary Liberal party, I take full responsibility for the loss this evening,” he said. “But we as a party, we as a government should be very proud of what we have achieved together. “Make no mistake, we’ve made history of being in government for the longest time since our party was formed. And our government has achieved so much in so many ways. We’ve kept NSW strong, free and fair.” In their speeches, both leaders paid tribute to one another for a campaign which had largely avoided going negative. Perrottet said he believed Minns would make a “fine 47th premier … because I believe that he will lead with the same decency and the same integrity that he has led with so far,” he said. Labor had been keen to play the expectation management game earlier on Saturday, pointing out that despite polls favouring the party it had a narrow path to victory. It needed nine seats to form a majority, with only four on margins of less than 5%. It had not held Goulburn – held on 3.1% – since 1965, and by the end of counting on Saturday night it remained too close to call. But it didn’t matter. Labor gains in regional seats of South Coast and Monaro – both seats previously held by the Coalition on safe margins – as well as in Sydney’s west in Parramatta, Riverstone, Penrith, East Hills, Ryde and Camden – meant it was in a position to form government. Labor also remained in the hunt for the seat of Balmain, held by the Greens since 2011. The Liberal party also lost Wakehurst and Berejiklian’s former seat of Willoughby to independents Michael Regan and Larissa Penn. It is only the third time Labor has won government from opposition in NSW – most recently in 1995, when Bob Carr won with a one-seat margin. Labor’s path to victory relied on a narrow message focused on the Coalition’s record on privatisation, scrapping its controversial public sector wages cap and promises to lift spending on health and education infrastructure. But the party was criticised for refusing to back Perrottet’s push on gambling reform, instead offering only a trial of the mandatory cashless gaming systems on 500 poker machines across the state. Their victory will mark a blow for anti-gambling advocates, who had hailed Perrottet’s push on the issue as a generational reform in the pokies capital of Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/18/us-agency-usaid-accuses-putin-reckless-decision-ukraine-grain-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-18T15:05:37Z","webTitle":"USAid chief accuses Putin of ‘reckless’ exit from Ukraine grain deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/us-agency-usaid-accuses-putin-reckless-decision-ukraine-grain-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/18/us-agency-usaid-accuses-putin-reckless-decision-ukraine-grain-deal","fields":{"bodyText":"The head of USAid has accused Vladimir Putin of making a “life and death decision” affecting millions of the world’s poorest people by withdrawing from the year-old UN-brokered deal that let Ukraine export grain through the Black Sea. Speaking in the shadow of several vast grain silos in the key trading port of Odesa, Samantha Power pledged a further $250m to create and expand alternative routes for Ukrainian grain to leave the country, but admitted nothing would compensate for the loss of the Black Sea ports. Her visit came after Russia carried out a series of missile and drone strikes on southern and eastern Ukraine overnight. Most of the missiles were shot down but falling debris damaged some infrastructure in Odesa port. Russia had vowed to retaliate after a blast on a bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula on Monday. Moscow accused Ukraine of attacking the Kerch Bridge, used to transport military supplies to Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014. “In recent weeks Russia began blocking ships from entering this port, and yesterday Putin made the reckless and dangerous decision to end Russian participation in the Black Sea grain initiative,” Power said. “Putin decided to cut off a vital lifeline to the rest of the world, and overnight and this morning Russian forces fired drones and cruise missiles not far from where we are standing right now.” She said Putin’s justification for pulling out of the agreement was full of “falsehood and lies” and the decision would have a huge impact on the least developed countries, including Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sudan and Somalia. “This is a life and death decision that Putin has made … Vladimir Putin might be willing to inflict this humanitarian pain on innocents but the US is not,” she said. Power called on other governments, philanthropists and the private sector to match the US contribution by raising an additional $250m. The Ukrainian minister for infrastructure, Oleksandr Kubrakov, who was accompanying Power, said he was still hopeful of brokering an agreement with Turkey and the UN that would allow the shipments to continue. Russia has said it could return to the grain deal but only if its demands are met for rules to be eased for its own exports of food and fertiliser. The mayor of Odesa, Gennadiy Trukhanov, said in an interview at Odesa’s grand city administration building that even when the grain deal was active, the city’s port had been working at a maximum of 15% of its prewar capacity. He said most of the 4,000 people who worked at the port had lost their jobs since the start of the war. Trukhanov said the cruise missile strikes in the early hours of Tuesday were “a very crude signal from the Russians to make sure no further ships leave from the port. I can’t imagine there’s any captain who would risk missile strikes and dock here with no guarantees”. The Kremlin said the strikes were in retaliation for Monday’s bridge attack. Ukraine’s air force said six Kalibr missiles and 31 of 36 drones were shot down. Odesa has often been attacked since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The latest strikes were “further proof that the country-terrorist wants to endanger the lives of 400 million people in various countries that depend on Ukrainian food exports”, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential staff, said on Telegram. Moscow, for its part, said it had foiled a Ukrainian drone strike on Crimea, with no major damage on the ground, and reopened a single lane of road traffic on the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine’s foreign minister indicated that Kyiv was willing to give Turkey time to see if it could negotiate Russia’s return to the Black Sea grain deal, but said a way must be found within days to export Ukrainian grain on to the world markets. Dymytro Kuleba said very intensive consultations would be held “in the next hours and days”, adding that Russia’s warning Ukrainian ships would not be protected is “a clear threat formulated in a legally neutral way. What it means is that Russia does not guarantee the safety of any ship that tries to carry Ukrainian cereals from Ukrainian ports to the Bosphorus. We have to understand that as long as Russia is in Crimea and believes it can blackmail and impose its will on anyone, these problems will continue. The best way to solve the problem actually is to defeat Russia and make them withdraw”. He added: “If Turkey wants to have another round of conversations with Russia about the commitment of Russia to the deal that it signed with Turkey, we are fine with that.” Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s termination of the deal meant the “withdrawal of navigation safety guarantees, curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, and restoration of the regime of a temporarily dangerous area in the north-western Black Sea”. “Without appropriate security guarantees, certain risks arise here,” the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Were a new arrangement to allow for exports “formalised without Russia, then these risks should be taken into account”, Peskov said. The Russian government added it would send its food to the poorest countries in Africa for free. At previous points when the grain deal was close to collapsing, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has persuaded Putin to back down by threatening to send the Turkish navy to escort grain ships out of Ukrainian ports, but positions may now be more entrenched. With Poland saying it would maintain an embargo on Ukrainian grain to protect its own farmers, it becomes even more urgent that Ukrainian grain can use sea routes. The Italian prime minister, Georgia Meloni, gave one of the toughest responses to the end of the deal, saying: “Russia’s decision to terminate the grain deal shows who is a friend and who is an enemy of the poorest states. The leaders of nations who don’t distinguish between the attacked and the aggressor should reflect. Using hunger as a weapon is another crime against humanity.” Andrew Mitchell, the UK’s Africa and development minister, said: “We should make it clear that the impact of what Russia is doing is directly leading to people starving in Africa.” Agencies contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/30/spain-election-stalemate-drags-on-as-pedro-sanchezs-socialist-party-loses-crucial-seat","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-30T11:33:04Z","webTitle":"Spain stalemate drags on as Pedro Sánchez’s socialist party loses crucial seat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/30/spain-election-stalemate-drags-on-as-pedro-sanchezs-socialist-party-loses-crucial-seat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/30/spain-election-stalemate-drags-on-as-pedro-sanchezs-socialist-party-loses-crucial-seat","fields":{"bodyText":"Spain’s socialist party has suffered a setback in its efforts to form a new leftwing coalition government after this month’s inconclusive election as a count of overseas votes handed a crucial seat across to the opposition conservatives. The result means the left and right blocs are now neck and neck as MPs prepare for a vote in congress that will determine who gets to govern. The left’s hopes of remaining in power now rest even more firmly on Junts, the centre-right Catalan pro-independence party led by Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan regional president who fled Spain to avoid arrest over his role in the failed unilateral bid for independence almost six years ago. Although the rightwing People’s party (PP) won the snap election, it fell well short of expectations and only narrowly beat the Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), led by the acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Faced with another hung parliament, the PSOE had appeared to be the major party most likely to be able to cobble together the parliamentary numbers to win an investiture vote. But the overseas vote, which was counted and factored into the overall result on Saturday, means the right and the left bloc now each have 171 seats in the 350-seat congress. Should the small Canarian Coalition party ditch its stated aversion to supporting any PP government that includes the far-right Vox party, the right bloc’s seat count could rise to 172. Both blocs are now exploring their options as congress prepares to convene on 17 August. King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs’ backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority of 176 of the 350 seats in Spain’s lower house. If the candidate falls short of the 176 seats – as is likely to be the case – a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority – more votes for than against – will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year. The new arithmetic means that the abstention of Junts will no longer be enough to see the PSOE and its partners in the new Sumar alliance into power through the second-round simple majority vote. Instead, Sánchez will need at least one Junts MP to vote for his coalition government. Junts has made it abundantly clear that its support will come at a price. It has already called for an amnesty for those still facing charges over the secessionist push, such as Puigdemont, and for a binding referendum on Catalan independence. The PSOE has made it plain that neither option is on the table and that any negotiations will be carried out in accordance with the constitution. Puigdemont appears to be biding his time and has said failure to reach agreement with his party could lead to another vote at the end of the year. “If, six days ago, the provisional result had already placed us at the centre of conversation and speculation, with the final results at hand the position has become even starker: either Junts votes yes or the PSOE ends up facilitating the investiture of [the PP leader Alberto Núñez] Feijóo … or we go to the repeat of the elections,” Puigdemont wrote in a long tweet on Saturday. “Not enough time has passed to know what the two big Spanish parties will end up doing.” Sánchez has already insisted that another election will not be necessary, saying he was “sure that our democracy can find a formula for government”. He has ruled out doing anything to facilitate a PP-led government. The PP, which has repeatedly attacked Sánchez for what it sees as his cynical reliance on Basque and Catalan independence parties, has now said it is willing to talk to Junts “within the terms of the constitution”. But the PP’s potential coalition partners in Vox are unlikely to be in favour of any such negotiations. The far-right party, whose rise was largely fuelled by the Catalan independence crisis, said it would take a firm line on regional independence should it enter government, adding it had “no doubt” that tensions in Catalonia would rise once more with the PP and Vox in power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-27T17:27:59Z","webTitle":"Defeat would leave Russia brutal and vindictive even if Putin ‘disappeared’, says RAF chief – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/may/27/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-and-eu-decry-moscows-plan-to-deploy-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus","fields":{"bodyText":"Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. Two years ago, Raman Pratasevich, a young Belarusian dissident blogger, was white-knuckled, begging a Ryanair flight crew not to make an emergency landing at Minsk airport, writes Andrew Roth and Shaun Walker. He said: “Don’t do this, they will kill me, I am a refugee,” according to a fellow passenger. The plane, escorted by a Belarusian Mig-29 fighter jet sent to force it down, landed anyway. Pratasevich was promptly arrested. Last week he emerged from custody. The activist and blogger, accused of more than 1,586 crimes, was charged on 10 counts including conspiracy to seize power. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and then promptly pardoned, his reward from Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for becoming a full-throated mouthpiece of the regime. Ukraine’s ministry of defence has tweeted this video footage. Around 400 Ukrainian soldiers have started training on American M1 Abrams tanks in Germany, the New York Times reported. Half of the group started training in Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels in southern Germany, being taught medical skills and how to shoot firearms. The other half were taught how to fuel and maintain the tanks. Around 31 tanks were due to be sent to Germany to be used in the training programme, which is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks, according to the newspaper. A 73-year-old woman has died and two others have been injured after Russian troops shelled 16 areas in Zaporizhzhia, a local Ukrainian governor said. Yurii Malashko reported that Russia had launched 108 attacks against the southeastern city in one day using artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, and drones. Malashko wrote on the Telegram messaging app: “The enemy will be held accountable for every war crime, for every broken fate and life that has been cut short. Ukrainians are strong and unbreakable, Victory is ours.” The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 6pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s headlines: Preliminary operations have begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of deoccupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines.

That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Russia failed in a bid to prevent Ukraine taking a place on the World Health Organization’s Executive Board, on a day which also saw North Korea gain a berth. Ten countries joined the board for a three-year term but Russia tried to exclude Ukraine, which it invaded 15 months ago, from joining the 34-nation forum at the ongoing World Health Assembly in Geneva. Normally those joining the forum, which plays a key role in the governance of the WHO, are elected on the nod but Moscow forced the first vote since 1977 at this year’s 76th assembly. In the event, the vote was easily carried by 123 votes to 13. Russia’s delegation stated: “We deeply regret the fact that the assembly has voted for a country that will simply further politicise the work of the EB,” saying it opposed “politicisation of the work of the WHA and of the WHO as a whole.” There was further acrimony at the gathering after the United States said it regretted the extension of a place for North Korea after it was put forward by South East Asia. Ukraine struck oil pipeline installations deep inside Russia on Saturday with a series of drone attacks including on a station serving the vast Druzhba oil pipeline that sends western Siberian crude to Europe, according to Russian media. Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia have been growing in intensity in recent weeks, and the New York Times reported that US intelligence believes Ukraine was behind a drone attack on the Kremlin earlier this month. Ukraine has not publicly acknowledged launching attacks against targets inside Russia. The Ukrainian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday, Reuters reported. In the Tver region, which lies just north-west of Moscow, two drones attacked a station that serves the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline, one of the world’s largest oil pipelines, the Kommersant newspaper said. The Tver local council said that a drone had crashed near the village of Erokhino, about 500 km (310 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The Telegram channel Baza, which has good sources among Russia’s security services, said the drones attacked a station serving the Druzhba pipeline. Preliminary operations have already begun to pave the way for a counteroffensive against Russian occupying forces, a Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. “It’s a complicated process, which is not a matter of one day or a certain date or a certain hour,” Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview with the Guardian. “It’s an ongoing process of de-occupation, and certain processes are already happening, like destroying supply lines or blowing up depots behind the lines. “The intensity is increasing, but it will take quite a long period of time,” he added, predicting that as the counteroffensive gathered momentum, there would be more incursions into Russia by Russian rebel groups, such as the raid in Belgorod region earlier this week. On Saturday the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, raised expectations that a major operation could be imminent by declaring on social media: “The time has come to take back what’s ours.” Zaluzhnyi’s declaration on the Telegram messaging app was accompanied by a cinematic video showing heavily armed Ukrainian soldiers preparing for battle to a soundtrack of ominous music and a narrator reciting a prayer calling for strength to “annihilate” Ukraine’s enemies. Russian forces have intercepted two long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied to Ukraine by Britain, the RIA news agency cited the defence ministry as saying on Saturday. Reuters reports that the ministry said it had intercepted shorter-range US-built Himars-launched and Harm missiles, and shot down 13 drones in the last 24 hours, RIA reported. More on the expulsion of German diplomats from Russia (see 12:53pm). Germany has said more than 100 employees will be withdrawn after Moscow imposed limits on the numbers allowed to work at diplomatic missions in Russia, a source with the German foreign ministry said on Saturday. “This limit, set by Russia for the beginning of June, requires a major cut in all areas of our presence in Russia,” the source said, Reuters reports. Those affected included teachers, as well as other employees of schools and the Goethe Institute, and was necessary to maintain the right balance for Germany’s diplomatic presence, said the person, who described the number affected as at least 100. Relations between Russia and Germany, which used to be the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, have broken down since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the west responded with sanctions and weapons supplies. The source called the limit, announced in April, “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible”. The person declined to say what the limit imposed by Moscow was. The number of German employees leaving was earlier reported by Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia is to start expelling German diplomats, teachers and employees of cultural institutions next month. The measure is expected to further exacerbate tensions between the two countries, which have already had very fraught ties since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year. The German foreign ministry criticised Russia’s move, calling it an “unilateral, unjustified and incomprehensible decision”. The expulsions will affect several hundred German state employees, including teachers and staff of the Goethe Institute, which promotes German culture and language abroad, the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported. It comes in response to the reduction of the presence of Russian intelligence services in Germany earlier this year. A construction worker has been killed near the Russian village of Plekhovo, a few kilometres from the border with Ukraine after shelling from the Ukrainian side, said Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region. Works were being carried out not far from Plekhovo on fortifying defensive lines for the state border, the governor said on Telegram. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. Russia has accused Japan of “cynical, unscrupulous speculation” over Tokyo’s comments around the nuclear threat Moscow poses and promised to respond to Japan’s latest round of sanctions imposed over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday that Japan would place additional sanctions on Russia after the G7 summit Tokyo hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Matsuno also condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying it would further inflame the situation and that Japan would never accept “Russia’s nuclear menace, let alone its use”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it was assessing the implementation of Japan’s sanctions on its national security and economy and would not leave Tokyo’s “illegitimate actions” unanswered, Reuters reported. The ministry also took issue with Matsuno’s casting of Russia as engaging in “nuclear blackmail”. Defeat in its war against Ukraine would leave Russia “vindictive” and “brutal” and posing a threat to Nato countries, the outgoing head of the RAF said. Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston told The Telegraph that Russia’s air force, surface navy and submarine force are a threat to Britain and Nato. He warned its threat could even get worse if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was ousted. He said: When the Ukraine conflict is over and Ukraine has restored its borders, as it must, we will have a damaged, vindictive, and brutal Russia, whose means of harming us is through air attack, missile attack and subsurface attack. Sir Mike is set to step down next month after four years at the top of the RAF. He added: But it also demonstrates that this is more than about just one person. There is a whole structure and a hierarchy behind Putin. So even if Putin was to disappear off the stage, there are countless others that could replace him that could be as equally as brutal and vicious to their own people and to neighbouring states. Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official said on Saturday. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over its positions to regular Russian troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut after the longest and bloodiest battle of the war, Reuters reported. In a statement on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces have continued attacking but that “overall offensive activity has decreased”. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” She added that Ukrainian troops “firmly hold” the heights overlooking Bakhmut from the north and south, as well as a portion of the outskirts, but have not advanced during the past two days to focus on “other tasks”. Ukraine has asked Germany to supply it with Taurus cruise missiles, an air-launched weapon with a range of 500 km (310 miles), a spokesperson for the defence ministry in Berlin said on Saturday. Germany received the request several days ago, the spokesperson said, confirming a report by Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. She declined to provide further details or say how likely it was that Germany would supply the missiles to Ukraine. If it supplied the missiles, Germany would be following in the footsteps of Britain, which earlier in May became the first country to publicly provide Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. The United States has so far declined to supply Ukraine with the 297-km range Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles amid concerns that Ukraine could use them to strike inside Russia’s internationally recognised borders. Ukraine has been asking for months for these kind of weapons, but support from western allies has focused on shorter-range weapons Russia has dismissed criticism from the US president, Joe Biden, over Moscow’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington had for decades deployed just such nuclear weapons in Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said the weapons were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Reuters reported. The US state department denounced the Russian nuclear deployment plan. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid of a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” The US has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because of remarks by Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Tehran on Saturday accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy of anti-Iranian propaganda in his call for Iran to halt the supply of drones to Russia, saying his comments were designed to attract more arms and financial aid from the west. Zelenskiy in a video address on Wednesday called on Iranians to stop their slide into “the dark side of history” by supplying Moscow with drones. Iran initially denied supplying Shahed drones to Russia but later said it had provided a small number before the conflict began. Ukraine says the drones have played a major role in Russia’s attacks on cities and infrastructure. “The Ukrainian president’s repeat of delusional claims against the Islamic Republic of Iran is in line with the anti-Iranian propaganda and media war aimed at attracting as many arms and financial aid as possible from western countries,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement carried by Iranian media. Ukraine, Kanaani said, has been refusing to allow an independent investigation into these claims. A Belarus court has rejected an appeal by a jailed Polish-Belarusian journalist against his eight-year prison sentence for reporting critically on president Alexander Lukashenko’s regime. Agence France-Presse reports that Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza and active member of the Polish minority in Belarus, was sentenced in February. He had extensively reported on mass protests against Lukashenko and refused to leave the Moscow-allied country after authorities unleashed an historic crackdown on dissent. Belarus’s supreme court said in a statement that the sentence was “left unchanged”. The verdict has come into force. Poczobut, 50, who stood trial in his home city of Grodno, near the Polish border, was found guilty of taking part in “actions harming national security” and “inciting hatred”. Poland, Belarus’s western EU-member neighbour, has condemned the trial and called for his release. After Poczobut’s appeal was rejected, Warsaw said it would impose new punitive measures against Lukashenko’s regime next week. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, said on Twitter: On Monday, I will announce the decision to add to the sanctions list several hundred representatives of the Lukashenko regime responsible for political repression, including repression against Poles living in Belarus. Ukraine’s defence ministry has claimed Russia is planning to simulate a major accident at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station to try to thwart Kyiv’s long-planned counter-offensive. The plant, in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, has been repeatedly hit by shelling that each side blames the other for. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said Russian forces would soon shell the plant and then announce a radiation leak. This would force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped. The directorate’s statement, posted on Telegram, did not provide any proof. It said Russia had disrupted the planned rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who are based at the plant. The agency, which frequently posts updates on the plant, has made no mention of any disruption. Last week witnesses said Russian military forces had been enhancing defensive positions in and around the plant ahead of the counter-offensive. Ukraine is ready to launch its much-anticipated counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian official has told the BBC. The broadcaster reported that Oleksiy Danilov would not name a date but said an assault to retake territory from President Vladimir Putin’s occupying forces could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. He said Kyiv had “no right to make a mistake” on the decision because it was an “historic opportunity” that “we cannot lose”. As secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, Danilov is at the heart of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s de facto war cabinet. Danilov also told the BBC he was “absolutely calm” about Russia beginning to deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, saying: “To us, it’s not some kind of news.” The Wagner mercenary group’s forces have probably begun to withdraw from some of their positions around the devastated Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and are likely to be used for other offensive operations in the Donbas region, according to British intelligence. The UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update that Wagner’s owner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, had said the withdrawal had begun and positions were being transferred to Russian defence ministry forces. Kyiv corroborated Wagner’s rotation out from the city’s outskirts. The UK ministry said in its update, posted on Twitter, that forces of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic had probably entered the eastern Ukrainian city since Wednesday to start “clearance operations”. Bakhmut has been the scene of the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. The ministry said: Ukrainian forces had taken 20 square kilometres of Bakhmut’s flanks as of 16 May. The rotation out of Wagner forces is likely to continue in controlled phases to prevent collapse in pockets around Bakhmut. Despite Prigozhin’s ongoing feud with the Russian MOD [ministry of defence], Wagner forces will likely be used for further offensive operations in the Donbas following reconstituting its forces. US president Joe Biden has said he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has moved ahead with its plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, while the European Union has condemned the plan. Reuters reports that the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said: This is a step which will lead to further extremely dangerous escalation. Russia signed a pact with Belarus on Thursday about the storage of the warheads, at a facility due to be finished in just over a month. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said later that the relocation of some of the weapons had already begun. Borrell said the agreement contravened multiple international agreements. We call on Russia to abide by these commitments. The Belarusian regime is an accomplice in Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Borrell said any attempt “to further escalate the situation will be met by a strong and coordinated reaction”. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is Adam Fulton and here’s an overview of the latest. The European Union has condemned Russia’s plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus, while US president Joe Biden says he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia has already begun moving ahead with the plan. More on that story soon. In other news: The death toll from a Russian missile attack on an outpatient clinic in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro has risen to two, with 30 people wounded, according to media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: “Russian terrorists once again confirm their status of fighters against everything humane and honest.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, plans to visit Finland, Sweden and Norway from this Monday to deepen cooperation on top national security and economic issues, the US state department has said. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Finland has joined Nato, with Sweden’s bid to join awaiting ratification from Hungary and Turkey. A deal allowing the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian Black Sea ports has not yet resumed full operations, the UN said on Friday, having come to a halt before Russia’s decision last week to extend it. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has told China’s special envoy Li Hui there are “serious obstacles” to resuming peace talks, blaming Ukraine and western countries. Meanwhile, Russia’s deputy security council chair, Dmitry Medvedev, has said the conflict in Ukraine could last for decades and negotiations with Ukraine were impossible as long as Volodymyr Zelenskiy was in power. The former UK prime minister Boris Johnson and former US president Donald Trump discussed Ukraine and “the vital importance of Ukrainian victory” on Thursday, a spokesperson for Johnson said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said in a phone call with his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, that Russia is open to dialogue over Ukraine. Lula tweeted that he had reiterated Brazil’s willingness to talk to both sides of the war in Ukraine but declined Putin’s invitation to visit. Russia has blamed Kyiv for dozens of strikes on its southern Belgorod region. Its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the Ukrainian military was responsible for artillery, mortar and drone attacks across the region over 24 hours but reported no casualties. In a rare attack on the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, east of Crimea, two drones damaged buildings in the city centre, officials said. In the neighbouring Rostov region, the governor said a Ukrainian missile had been shot down near Morozovsk, where there is a Russian airbase. Canada will donate 43 AIM-9 missiles to Ukraine to help the country “secure its skies”, the national defence has said. “Canada’s support for Ukraine is unwavering,” said Canada’s defence minister, Anita Anand. The country also said it welcomed Ukraine’s application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership (CPTPP). Moscow’s city court will hold a preliminary hearing next Wednesday in a new criminal case against the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges including incitement to extremism. The Russian arms company Kalashnikov, maker of the world’s most widely used assault rifle, is launching a division for the production of kamikaze drones – a key weapon used in the Ukraine war. Ukraine said it shot down 10 missiles and 25 drones launched by Russia in overnight attacks on the capital of Kyiv, the city of Dnipro and eastern regions. Several drones and missiles hit targets in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, officials said on Friday. There was no immediate word of any deaths. The city of Donetsk has come under fire from Ukrainian forces, the Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said. As a result, he said, a young woman died and another was injured. Japan will place additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, has said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-18T15:30:35Z","webTitle":"Bank of England denies QE caused double-digit inflation; mortgage arrears and repossessions jump – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2023/may/18/royal-mail-loss-european-carmakers-post-brexit-rules-bank-of-england-business-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Time for a recap…. The Bank of England has rejected claims that its QE bond-buying programme is to blame for inflation soaring over 10%. In a session with the Treasury Committee, policymakers explained to MPs that it was the supply chain problems caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and then the surge in food and energy prices after the Ukraine invasion, that drove inflation to its highest in decades. The BoE also pushed back against criticism that the unwinding of QE, called quantitative tightening or QT, could be destabilising markets. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden liked QT to ‘descending a mountain’, rather than decommissioning a nuclear sub, arguing that the Bank wanted to be able to climb future peaks by doing more QE if necessary. There are also signs today that higher interest rates are hitting the housing market. The number of homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year. That included a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance said. In other news: Take note, younger readers. Children’s income in the UK has risen by 11% in the last year, ahead of inflation and rather faster than average wages. The figures on children’s pocket money and earnings – part of what was claimed to be the most in-depth study of the UK’s “youth economy” – also found that six-year-olds had enjoyed the biggest “pay rise”, in the form of a 34% annual increase. Meanwhile, average earnings from babysitting leapt 24% in a year to top £20, while some savvy children were able to prise cash out of their parents for “jobs” such as making someone a coffee or smiling for a family photo. The data was based on the finances of more than 125,000 children and was collected from user activity on the NatWest Rooster Money pocket money app and prepaid debit card. Whether it was down to parents deciding to shield their children’s finances from the worst of the cost of living crisis, or an improvement in youngsters’ ability to negotiate a better financial deal and monetise small tasks, the study – based on data collected between 1 March 2022 and 28 February this year – suggested that British kids have fared a lot better financially than many adults. More here…. Shareholders in Next, the high street and online retailer, have launched something of a revolt today. Around 20% of shares were cast against chairman Michael Roney being reelected, at today’s AGM. Advisory group PIRC had recommended investors should vote against Roney, because he also chairs Grafton Group, the builders merchants. PIRC argued: “It is considered that a chair cannot effectively represent two corporate cultures. “The possibility of having to commit additional time to the role in times of crisis is ever present. There was also a protest against Next’s pay policies, with 16% opposing the remuneration report. The age of huge UK property price increases may be coming to an end, according to a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility. David Miles, one of three members of the UK budget watchdog’s top committee, argues that slowing population growth slows and higher interest rates will weigh on house prices. Miles told a speech at an Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence conference in London that: “Those forces driving them up are going to be much weaker, I suspect, in the next 40 years than they have been in the past 40 years. “If anything, this unusual age of massive rises of house prices may be nearing an end.” The boss of Burberry has complained that the UK is at a “competitive disadvantage for global shoppers” which has held back sales in its home market after the government ditched a VAT tax break for tourists. Jonathan Akeroyd, the chief executive of the luxury British brand best known for its signature check and raincoats, said sales to tourists had risen 19% in London in the three months to April but they had tripled in Paris and were up 43% in Milan. He said total sales had risen 28% in the UK for the year as locals and visitors from Europe from the US, Asia and the Middle East spent more, but he noted a big surge in UK tourists spending in Europe, “which is quite telling”. Akeroyd said: “We are disappointed the government chose to scrap the VAT retail export scheme. It leaves the UK at a competitive disadvantage for global shoppers. We are celebrating the fact that we are a British luxury brand and very hopeful that when tourists come to the UK they are coming to Burberry. We are really hoping this [tax change] can be revisited.” More here: This echoes a similar warning from the chairman of Burberry last month: The pound has sagged to its lowest level since late April today, down three-quarters of a cent at $1.241. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA, says the markets seem ‘unmoved’ by BoE governor Andrew Bailey’s warning yesterday about a ‘wage-price spiral’ gripping the UK. We heard from some Bank of England policymakers earlier as they were grilled by the Treasury Select Committee on quantitative tightening, among other things naturally. Bailey and colleagues were quite consistent in their messaging and it’s probably what the Governor said on Wednesday that raised a few eyebrows as he insinuated that the UK could be seeing a wage-price spiral which could complicate returning inflation to 2%. The members were still confident in their assessment despite repeated reminders of apparent past failures and markets seem unconcerned about the supposed wage-price spiral, continuing to price in one, maybe two, hikes this year. Things should become much clearer very soon. The increase in the number of households falling into early arrears on their mortgages “should not be a cause for panic”, says Sonia Fernandes, principal, mortgages at UK Finance. Writing in a blog on UK Finance’s website, Fernandes explains: “Lenders are proactively supporting borrowers who are worried about their finances. “Over the last year, lenders have helped nearly 200,000 borrowers who cannot meet their full mortgage payment by providing tailored forbearance.” Fernandes adds that borrowers can seek help as soon as they needed it: “Tailored forbearance means that a lender will offer support focused on the borrower’s individual circumstances and what they can afford to pay. “Examples of the support available includes a period of reduced payments, a period of zero payments or a temporary switch to interest-only. Importantly borrowers will never be asked to pay more than they can afford. “There is no need for a borrower to wait until they have missed a payment to seek help. Over the last year, lenders proactively supported two million borrowers with financial difficulty assistance, including budgeting support, access to debt advice and breathing space.” Over in the US, the number of new claims for jobless support has fallen. There were 242,000 ‘initial claims’ filed across the US last week, a drop of 22,000, suggesting America’s labour market is holding up relatively well. The fall comes after fraudulent claims in at least one state boosted the numbers in previous weeks, Bloomberg reports, adding: On an unadjusted basis, claims decreased by the most in two months, to 215,810, largely due to a drop in Massachusetts. Some economists have been wary about drawing strong conclusions from the data amid reports that fraudulent claims have been behind the recent upward trend in filings. Over in Tokyo, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak has announced what sounds like a hefty jump in Japanese investment into the UK. Japanese businesses have commited “almost £18 billion investment in the UK”, the government says, in a handily timed announcement as Sunak hosts a business reception in Tokyo. Much of this planned investment will be in green energy, but some will only arrive over the next decade. Japanese trading house Marubeni is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with the UK, which envisages approximately £10bn of investment in the UK with its partners over the next 10 years. This will include offshore wind projects in Scotland and green hydrogen projects in Wales and Scotland. There’s also £4bn from Sumitomo Corporation, to expand offshore wind projects off the coasts of Suffolk and Norfolk. Political leaders do like to coral such deals together into a nice round number to mark such visits or events. Earlier this week, France hailed €13bn worth of future investments pledged by international companies at its Choose France event. Today, Sunak says: These new investments are a massive vote of confidence in the UK’s dynamic economy, from some of Japan’s top firms. The UK certainly needs a boost of spending. Business investment is still 1.4% below its pre-pandemic levels, last week’s GDP report showed. However, today’s announcement does not include new investment from Japan’s car industry, at a time when the UK auto sector is gripped by concerns over Brexit trade rules. Sunak, who is in Japan for the G7 meeting of world leaders, was asked about calls to delay new rules of origin regulations, to help the British car industry. Speaking to broadcasters on board the JS Izumo aircraft carrier in the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, he said: “It’s something that car manufacturers across Europe, not just in the UK, have raised as a concern. “We are engaged in a dialog with the EU about how we might address those concerns when it comes to auto manufacturing more generally.” The investment flow between Japan and the UK isn’t just one way, though. UK company Octopus Energy is to invest £1.5bn in the Asia-Pacific energy market by 2027, to speed up the shift to “a cleaner, smarter energy system”. The jump in people in arrears with their mortgage, or being reposessed, shows that rising borrowing costs and rampant inflation are battering household budgets. Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, explains: “The golden era of low mortgage rates has come to an end following a rapid rise in interest rates to combat red hot and sticky inflation. Almost two million mortgage holders on tracker rates have felt the brunt of each of the 12 consecutive base rate hikes as they came. Meanwhile, the uptick in mortgage rates is a kick in the teeth for mortgage holders who have come off a fixed rate deal in recent history. “There could unfortunately be a new wave of borrowers falling behind on repayments in the near future, as there are around 700,000 borrowers with fixed rate mortgages - the majority of which were set at interest rates below 2% - maturing in the second half of the year alone. However, the current low level of unemployment could slow the rise in mortgage arrears and repossessions. “The fact that buy-to-let mortgages in arrears are increasing at a faster rate than residential mortgages shows that landlords have not been immune to the cost-of-living squeeze on budgets, Jobson points out: Recent research by the ONS revealed that tenants are 4.4 times as likely to be experiencing financial hardship compared to homeowners. Missed or delayed rent payments could leave many smaller landlords in a financially precarious position. This cohort may have also seen their profit margins recede dramatically after coming off a fixed rate mortgage because of heightened mortgage costs. “Those struggling to keep up with mortgage repayments should contact their lender as their first port of call to explore their options and support available. It is worth consulting a debt advice charity such as StepChange or Turn2Us and they will go through all of your options.” Sky News is reporting that the online party goods supplier founded by the Princess of Wales’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, has been sold after it failed to avoid collapsing into administration. Party Pieces Holdings, launched by the Middletons in 1987, was bought on Thursday by James Sinclair, an entrepreneur, Sky says. They add: Sources said the sale had been implemented through a pre-pack administration, meaning it had appointed insolvency practitioners before being sold without some of its liabilities. It was unclear what price Mr Sinclair’s company, Teddy Tastic Bear Co Ltd, had paid or how big the liabilities were that had been left behind. Across the economy, company insolvencies in England and Wales fell by 15% in April, after rising to a three-year high in March, with companies high by higher interest rates and rising costs. The number of UK homes being repossessed and homeowners in arrears jumped in the first quarter of this year, according to figures from a trade association. There was a 50% increase in the number of homeowner mortgaged properties being repossessed in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, UK Finance has reported today. Some 750 homeowner mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023. UK Finance said the increase in repossessions is from a very low base, as cases make their way through the courts. More households fell behind with their mortgage payments too: there were 76,630 homeowner mortgages in arrears of at least 2.5% of their outstanding balance in the first quarter of 2023, 2% more than in the previous quarter. The data also shows a rise in buy-to-let mortgages have fallen into arrears, as landlords are hit by rising interest rates rise. There were 7,030 buy-to-let mortgages where landlords were in arrears by 2.5% or more of the outstanding balance at the end of March, UK Finance reports, an increase of 16% compared to the previous quarter. Also, 410 buy-to-let mortgaged properties were taken into possession in the first quarter of 2023, 28 per cent greater than in the previous quarter. Away from the Bank of England, EasyJet’s chief executive Johan Lundgren said rival airlines were setting fares “way out of proportion”. Lundgren argues that demand means his own carrier could be set for record summer profits, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham reports. Speaking after announcing narrowing winter losses this morning (see earlier post), Lundgren said analyst consensus suggested that easyJet would have its best ever summer financially. He said: “While it’s still early on, we’ve only sold 36% of the Q4 capacity, it’s very encouraging.” Air fares will be significantly higher this year, delighting some airline accountants, but Lundgren said easyJet would still be “providing exceptional value.” He said that the average easyJet fare for in the summer months was still £75, adding: “There are a number of legacy and full-service airlines completely pricing themselves way out of any proportion, which is giving up the opportunity to really demonstrate the value proposition that we have”. He cited research that showed 45% of people now said they were more likely to fly with a low-cost airline than before the pandemic. He said the airline had been operating well despite French air traffic strikes, with capacity already not far off summer peak, but after last year’s cancellations and disruption due to staffing issues, ““We are absolutely not complacent.” EasyJet is opening a base at Birmingham, its first new UK base in a decade, and said it will have a million more seats overall on UK flights this summer than in 2019. All these metaphors (comparing QT to climbing down a mountain) and explanations about the future direction of QE/QT are confusing everyone and blur the Bank’s message (again), warns Professor Costas Milas of University of Liverpool’s management school. He tells us that the facts are as follows: The MPC’s revised forecasts for higher inflation and output underestimate (in my view) the strength of monetary tightening already in place. Divisia money has contracted to a historically low of -3.2% in 2023Q1. This should imply lower inflation and lower GDP growth than currently predicted by the MPC (as I discuss in my co-authored European Journal of Finance paper:) Nevertheless, there is an alternative (but not very flattering) explanation. Current monetary tightening could be less effective than previously thought because the MPC (sadly) lacks credibility (as evidenced by household expectations of inflation that are consistently higher than those of the MPC). In other words, the MPC will be forced to tighten much more than what it has done in the past in order to hit the 2% inflation target… UK benchmark borrowing costs have hit the highest level since the aftermath of the mini-budget. The yield, or interest rate, on 10-year UK gilts has risen to 3.915% today, the highest since last October. That follows the suggestion from the Bank of England this morning that its quantitative easing programme could be higher next year than in 2023, implying more sales of bonds back to the market. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The Bank of England then denies that its quantitative easing programme has fuelled a surge in asset price inflation. Governor Andew Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that real asset prices have not surged under QE in the way that is often reported. Real equity prices certainly haven’t, Bailey says. Actually, the period in which the house price to income ratio rose most was the period of 10 years before 2007. That was the period when it rose most substantially. It haven’t done the same thing since then. Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden then tells MPs that investors think Britain has a bigger inflation problem than the United States. That, he tells the Treasury Committee, explains why British government bond yields have risen by more than their US counterparts. Asked why the spread between interest rates on UK gilts and German bunds, and US Treasury bills, has widened, Ramsden explains: “My take on this is that there is more of a concern about persistence of inflation (in Britain) and therefore an expectation that our short-term (interest) rate - set by us - will be higher. That feeds through into yields.” Ramsden also told the Treasury Committee that expectations of US monetary policy have also changed, with the markets starting to anticipate possible cuts by the US Federal Reserve due to problems in the US banking sector. Ramsden also reminds Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom that high UK borrowing is amother important factor influencing bond yields. The UK’s debt management office is issuing £243bn of debt this year, up from £125bn, he says, due to the fiscal interventions following the pandemic. Thirdly, Ramsden suggests that the chaos following last September’s mini-budget is still a factor, given the turmoil in the liability driven investment (LDI) pension market caused by the jump in bond yields. He says: The third factor which may explain some of those yield differentials is that there may be a bit of a risk premium, or liquidity premium, following on from the LDI episode. It may be that some of the pension funds and the like have not come back as fully into the market or they’re still adjusting, so you don’t have the same demand for some of those longer term gilts as you had in the past. That means that the price of them may be lower than it might otherwise be, so the yield is higher. Q: If monetary policy acts with a lag, as you argue, why is the Bank continuing to raise interest rates when inflation is expected to fall? That’s a question we spend hours discussing, Ben Broadbent smiles, and there’s a “range of views”. The issue is how long the ‘second-round effects’ of inflation, on wages and prices, lingers, as an interest rise today will have little impact by the end of 2023. These rate increases are “causing more pain to people out there”, says John Baron MP (who had just been arguing that rates should have been raised faster). Broadbent explains that the Bank’s forecasts are conditional on the markets’ interest rate forecasts. So if rates were cut further, inflation would be higher…. Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank shares Baron’s concerns that inflation could be stickier than hoped, which is one reason it raised interest rates again this month, to 4.5%. The committee will return to this issue at another session next week. John Baron MP shoots back that central banks, such as the Bank of England, were behind the curve in waking up to rising inflation. Had the Bank been more proactive, there might be less pain for people today, Baron suggests. Q: A month before Ukraine, inflation was on a sharp trajectory higher at 6%, interest rates were 0.5%. Wasn’t that a woeful neglect of duty? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent point out that interest rates were low for a decade without causing a rise in inflation. There’s a distinction between causing an inflation shock, and being slow to respond to one, Broadbent insists, pointing to the enormous economic shocks from the pandemic and the Ukraine war. He explains to the committee how the pandemic led to a shift in demand for goods, globally, pushing up prices. The key question was how long that would last for – the Bank’s MPC judged that if this demand, and disruption, was caused by the pandemic, then the end of the pandemic would bring it down. That wasn’t a terrible judgement, Broadbent insists, pointing out that the price of computer chips and lumber has dropped as expected. However, the China lockdown did last longer than expected. Broadbent explains: You always have to look forward and ask yourself, how long will this continue? Baron isn’t convinced, saying it was “quite evident” that inflation, even before Ukraine, would not fall away significantly. Broadbent disputes it, citing consensus forecasts at the time were that inflation would come down. “Ah, consensus forecasts…”, says Baron dismissively. Broadbent point out that these 30 forecasts are from people who spend their lifetime doing this work. Back at Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England is rejecting claims that its quantitative easing bond-buying programme is responsible for the UK’s cost of living crisis. Conservative MP John Baron asks the BoE top brass about the link between QE and the UK’s bout of double-digit inflation. Q: You announced a large expansion of QE in 2020. Was it simply a coincidence that inflation rose from 0.3% in 2020 when you launched your final tranche of QE to over 5% by the end of 2021? Governor Andrew Bailey points out that the UK economy has been hit by several shocks, including the Covid-19 supply chain shock and the Ukraine war. They both drove up inflation, and aren’t to do with QE or QT. Bailey tells the Treasury Committee that the UK has not seen a strong recovery in demand since the pandemic, which indicates that QE is not the cause of inflation. Baron points out that UK inflation was running at 6% before the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so “we were already on a steep trajectory”. Bailey agrees, but says the Bank was weighing up whether the inflationary shock from Covid-19 would be transitory, or not. If the only shock that the world had experienced was that one [the Covid-19 supply chain disruption] then I think the evidence now suggests it had a limited time period. Unfortunately, of course, Ukraine came along, and there was no gap between these shocks. As such, Bailey says we can’t use the word “transitory” to describe these shocks. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent points out that the UK had 10 years of QE without an inflation problem, or strong money growth, as did other regions such as the US and the eurozone [he outlined this in a detailed speech last month]. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden tells MPs that the Bank launched more QE after the pandemic began, because it feared the economy would suffer ‘permanent scarring’. Ramsden voted to end QE early, in September 2021, as he grew more concerned about inflationary risks. But stopping QE early would have been a surprise, potentially jolting markets. And cutting QE early, by £30bn, might have taken just 0.2 or 0.3 percentage points off Uk inflation. Ben Broadbent suggests that market data indicates that the QE conducted in June and November 2021 may have added half a percentage point to UK inflation. The idea that this is the cause of double-digit [inflation] is not well-supported. Lloyds Banking Group has been forced to suspend the livestream of its AGM in Glasgow twice within the first 10 minutes, after climate protesters interrupted chairman Robin Budenberg’s opening remarks. It’s quite hard to hear what the protesters are saying, since they haven’t been given microphones and Lloyds keeps cutting out the feed, but it’s clear that they’re hitting out at the bank’s contribution to the climate crisis, through certain financial services. Budenberg has urged them to wait until the Q&amp;A segment, but to no avail, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Climate protesters have also staged a demonstration outside of the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow, alongside staff union Unite - which is separately concerned about the company’s decision to force staff to spend at least two days a week in-office. Anyone working compressed hours will also have to negotiate new working patterns with managers. Unite has previously said the move will do “immediate and tangible damage” to work-life balance and family budgets. Q: We’ve been told that quantitative tightening is similar to decommissioning a nuclear submarine, so it has to be done extremely carefully because the potential for things to go wrong is enormous…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent agrees that there are risks, but the Bank has taken them into account. It’s important to avoid selling bonds into illiquid markets, and to conduct QT in a very predictable, very gradual way, he explains. He tells the Treasury committee that the start of QT was delayed after the crisis in the LDI pensions market last autumn, for this reason. Broadbent says: It’s not the case that on the days we’ve sold these gilts there’s been any sort of disruption, and of course we watch for those things very closely. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden weighs in too, disputing the ‘nuclear submarine decommissioning’ angle. He tells the MPs that the bank still wants QE to be a monetary policy tool in future. Ramsden reminds the committee that he worked in the Treasury back in 2009, when then-governor Sir Mervyn King got in touch to say the Bank wanted to start quantitative easing. It was always seen that QE would not go on for ever, there would always be some QT, he explains. He compares the bond-buying programme to mountaineering, saying the Bank’s Asset Purchase Facility has grown to a size where the Bank reached “the top of the mountain” (the APF was £895bn at its peak, but is now shrinking under QT). Ramsden says: You have to be careful going back down the other side. Because you want to be in a position that you can climb another mountain afterwards, if you have to. So you always have to be very careful on the descent. A lot of accidents happen on the descent of mountains, Ramsden points out. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin shoots back out that you also run the risk of starting an avalanche…. Q: Is the Bank of England certain that QT is not having any impact on the market? We’ve had a bank failure since you started… Is it having any inflationary or disinflationary pressures? Governor Andrew Bailey says he doesn’t see any connection between quantitative tightening and the events in the banking sector. As proof, he points out that the UK banking system has not experienced stress in recent months – the failure of Silicon Valley UK bank was a “very idiosyncratic issue”, because it was the subsidiary of a bank that failed in the US. Bailey then explains that UK banks hold £1.5 trillion of “high quality liquid assets”, of which £900bn is reserves at the Bank of England. The BoE’s QT programme should reduce those reserves, with banks looking to hold other high quality liquid assets instead. But that rebalancing should be “entirely manageable and entirely natural”, he pledges…. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent reiterates that QT is already priced into the financial markets, and those asset price levels are used in the Bank’s economic forecasts. Broadbent says the Bank can’t tell exactly what impact QT is having, because it has already announced it (so it’s priced in…). But the Bank’s best bet is that it is having a fairly modest impact, maybe just 0.1 percentage point on inflation. Q: How might the size of the Bank’s QT programme change in future years? Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden says the Bank won’t definitely plump for another £80bn reduction in its bond holdings next year. That’s because it would mean lower ‘active sales’ of bonds, given that more of the Bank’s stock of gilts expires next year. Ramsden says bank analysis will determine the pace of QT: So there’s the potential for us to go up a little bit. I don’t see us going down, given the experience of the first year. Q: Why did the Bank set a target of selling £80bn of its stock of government bonds in the first year of QT? Deputy governor Ben Broadbent says there has to be a number (!), before explaining that ‘active sales of £10bn’ a quarter, on top of the £10bn of bonds which naturally mature each quarter, felt about right. He reveals that the Bank’s market experts warned that anything over £100bn might disturb market liquidity. The important point, Broadbent explains, is that the markets have a number for QT which is ‘priced in’ to bond prices (and thus the yields, or interest rate, on those bonds). On the days of the Bank’s QT auctions, there’s been no detectible moves in bond prices, he insists. Deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden denies that the Bank of England is “flying blind” with its QT programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin replies that the Bank is flying ‘slowly’, and reminds the Bank that the launch of QT was disrupted last autumn (due to the market chaos created by the mini-budget). Q: You announced the flight take-off, and then almost immediately had to land the plane when you started… Governor (captain?) Andrew Bailey points out that the Bank hasn’t actually begun – so it delayed the takeoff of QT, rather than returning to the runway. Bailey insists it was correct not to launch quantitative tightening operations in disturbed market conditions last autumn (the Bank waited until the start of November). And he denies that the Bank contributed to the disturbed markets, with its plan to sell some of its QT bonds back to investors. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey tells MPs that he does not believe the Bank’s balance sheet will return to its levels before the financial crisis, even once it has conducted its quantitative tightening (QT) programme. Treasury Committee chair Harriett Baldwin asks Bailey why the BoE decided last September to embark on QT – the process of cutting its holdings of government bonds bought since the 2008 crisis. [Reminder: the BoE had bought almost £900bn of UK gilts, in one programme launched after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and a second after the pandemic]. Bailey explains that the Bank wants to adjust its balance sheet so that it has headroom to do whatever it might need to do in the future. It does not want its balance sheet to simply get larger after every economic shock. But, the governor insists he does not “envisage” the BoE’s balance sheet returning to where it was before the financial crisis. The key reason is that QE has created a stock of cash reserves owned by commercial banks which sits on the liability side of the BoE’s balance sheet. There is “no question” that the banks will need to hold larger cash reserves to ensure prudential stability, and the UK is not alone in this, Bailey explains. Parliament’s Treasury Committee are starting a hearing with senior Bank of England officials now, at the Bank. MPs will grill BoE governor Andrew Bailey, and deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. The committee says Continuing its inquiry into quantitative tightening, the cross-party Committee of MPs will examine the impact of tightening on the economy, the role of quantitative easing in the outbreak of double-digit inflation, and whether tightening will bring inflation down. The government’s levelling-up agenda has taken a knock, with new growth figures showing that London was the fastest-growing part of the English economy last summer. London’s GDP grew by 0.9% in the third quarter of 2022, the ONS reports, making it the region with the largest positive quarter-on-quarter growth in Q3. The largest negative growth in England was in the East Midlands, where GDP shrank by 1.6%. Overall, the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in July-September. Wales’s economy struggled, with GDP falling by 2% in the quarter, while Scotland contracted by 0.3%. Growth in England and Northern Ireland was flat. North East England’s GDP grew by 0.7% in Q3 2022, with the South West expanding by 0.4%. All other English regions shrank. Inflationary pressures may be easing, according to the latest realtime data from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS found that 18% of trading businesses expect to raise the prices of goods or services they sell in June, down from 23% for May. More than a third (35%) of trading businesses reported an increase in the prices of goods or services bought in April compared with March; down from 38% when comparing March with February. Ovo Energy and Good Energy have been ordered to pay £4m after overcharging thousands of households on their gas and electricity bills by breaching the government’s energy price cap. The affected households will receive a combined total of £2.7m from the two companies while an extra £1.25m will go to vulnerable customers in the UK under Ofgem’s voluntary redress fund. The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, found that Ovo overcharged almost 11,000 customers by nearly £1.5m, or an average of £181 for each household, by failing to apply the government’s energy price guarantee which sets a maximum rate for every unit of energy used between last October and March. Good Energy overcharged just under 7,000 households a total of £391,650, or about £109 on their energy bills. The suppliers will repay the amounts to their customers, and have been ordered to make extra compensation payments for the “totally unacceptable” breach to the Ofgem fund. Good Energy will pay £1.25m to the redress fund “for the inadequate systems, processes and repeated inaccurate reporting of information” over an extended period, the regulator said. More here: Luxury carmaker Aston Martin has secured a £234m investment from China’s automotive manufacture Geely, sending its shares soaring this morning. Geely is buying 42m shares from chairman Lawrence Stroll’s Yew Tree Consortium at 335p each, and will subscribe to buy another 28m at the same price. This will give Geely a 17% stake, making it the company’s third-largest shareholder behind Yew Tree (with 21%) and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (with 18%). Aston Martin says Geely’s investment is part of a “new relationship agreement” to suport its growth plan. Stroll says: “This announcement is a further significant step towards delivering our ambition for Aston Martin. Geely Holding, who initially became a shareholder last year, sees tremendous potential for Aston Martin’s long-term growth and success. They offer us a deep understanding of the key strategic growth market that China represents, as well as the opportunity to access their range of technologies and components. Geely share our vision for Aston Martin and want to be a more significant shareholder. Aston Martin’s shares have jumped 12% in early trading, the top FTSE 250 riser, to 260p. Geely’s investment comes at an important time for the car industry, as pressure mounts to reform the Brexit trade deal, points out interactive investor’s head of investment Victoria Scholar: Aston Martin is a glamorous automaker with a chequered past having survived several bankruptcies. But James Bond’s favourite carmaker has revved back into the fast lane with a pick-up in sentiment spearheading investor returns on the stock. Demand for luxury goods including cars has proven to be extremely resilient amid the cost-of-living crisis and a growing tranche of ultra-high net worth consumers. Earlier this month Aston Martin reported a narrower pre-tax loss in the first quarter of £74m versus £112m year-on-year. This investment is a welcome developed at a time when there are growing concerns about the Brexit trade deal for UK auto manufacturing. Stellantis this week sounded the alarm over potential tariffs on exports to the EU. UK auto manufacturing has come under significant pressure since the referendum with annual car manufacturing more than halving between 2016 and 2022.” Untreated sewage pollution of rivers should have been managed sooner, the water industry chair said as she apologised for industry failures. Water UK chair Ruth Kelly told Times Radio that companies did not monitor sewage outflows until recently, with only 10% overseen in 2015. Speaking after the water industry apologised for its failings, and announced a £10bn infrastructure plan, Kelly said: “We should have acted quicker. We should have acted faster. We should have acted to prevent the untreated water sewage going into our rivers and onto our beaches. “We have listened, we get it and we have come today with a plan to put this right.” Asked whether the average executive pay of £1.1m per year could be justified, Kelly poined out that 50% of CEOs would forgo bonuses entirely. She said: “Shareholders have decided they wanted to pay for some of the brightest and best people to lead the water company industry.” Kelly also told BBC Breakfast that the UK public will face “modest upward pressure” on water bills for up to a century to pay for the clean up of sewage from rivers. Musician and environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey has said the water companies’ apology and sewers modernisation plan was “nothing to celebrate” as he said customers were left having to “pay them a second time” to clean up the country’s rivers. The former Undertones frontman told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What I’m actually hearing is no apology for the fact we’ve paid them for a service we haven’t got. “They are now suggesting that we should pay them a second time for a service we haven’t had. BT’s job cuts also show the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy. CEO Philip Jansen says BT will use AI to improve customer service. Jansen also said the job cut target announced this morning was the culmination of an existing programme, which includes 30,000 contractors employed to build its fibre network in the next few years. He told reporters: “It’s a rolling programme, but it’s a five to seven year landing zone.” Many of BT’s planned job cuts will fall on its UK workforce. CEO Philip Jansen told a call this morning that ‘a big chunk’ will be in the UK, on the ‘build side’ of the company Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: “BT is planning to cut 55,000 jobs by 2030 as it looks to slim down its operations and reduce its cost base. ‘A big chunk of job cuts will be in the UK’, said BT’s CEO Philip Jansen. It is targeting £3bn in cost savings by 2025. Full-year core earnings rose by 5% to £7.9 billion, in line with analysts’ expectations but BT reported disappointing free cashflow down 5% to £1.3 billion and pre-tax profits slumped 12% to £1.7 billion. Telecoms seems to be awash with job cuts at the moment with Vodafone and BT both reducing the size of their workforces. Both have been struggling with the pressures of inflation, most notably from energy. BT is focusing on digitisation and integrating AI, a shift which is likely to require fewer workers. Last year the telecoms operator was caught up in a bitter dispute with workers over wages amid the cost-of-living crisis, resulting in BT’s first national strike for 35 years. Shares in BT have fallen sharply today by over 7% and are languishing at the bottom of the FTSE 100, but the stock remains higher by just below 20% year-to-date.” Elsewhere this morning, easyJet has shrunk its losses as customers look to ‘safeguard’ their holidays in the cost of living squeeze. EasyJet reported a pre-tax loss of £415m for the six months to the end of March, an improvement on the £557m loss a year earlier. It carried 33.1 million passengers over the six months between October and March, a 41% increase on the 23.4m a year earlier. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline enters the summer period “with confidence”. Lundgren explains: Recent research has shown that travel is the number one priority for household discretionary spend with customers safeguarding their holidays and increasingly opting for low cost airlines and brands which provide great value. “easyJet holidays expects to deliver full year profits of more than £80 million as it continues its rapid growth in the UK alongside its entry into the European package holiday market. From summer it will start selling holidays in Switzerland which will be the first of a number of planned new European markets. Shares in easyJet are largely unmoved, though – up just 0.15% this morning at 521p. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group, says today’s update hasn’t provided the magic to drive easyJet’s shares higher. The tone is upbeat, but now investors will want to see the airline delivering on these rosy assumptions. Given still-high inflation, some scepticism probably isn’t entirely unwarranted. In the energy sector, National Grid has reported a jump in annual profits to almost £4.6bn. The surge in earnings comes amid growing concern that it is not connecting renewable energy projects fast enough to meet the UK’s climate targets, my colleague Jillian Ambrose reports. The FTSE 100 monopoly said its underlying operating profits climbed by 15% to £4.58bn for the financial year ending in March compared with the 12 months before. This was driven by a surge in profits from its electricity distribution business which climbed by 39% from the previous year to £1.2bn for the year to the end of March. National Grid is under pressure from developers to overhaul its approach to connecting new renewable energy projects to the grid as it emerged that many will be forced to wait more than a decade for a connection. The UK plans to run its grid entirely on clean electricity by 2035 but many renewable energy projects have been told they will need to wait until the late 2030s to provide clean power to the grid. The National Grid chief executive, John Pettigrew, said: “there has never been a more exciting time to be at the heart of the energy industry”. BT has seen Vodafone’s job losses earlier this week and “taken them to another level” this morning, says Matthew Dorset, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot:. Dorset adds: “The business has faced pressure from alternative network providers, although on the retail side customer numbers have remained stable. On the Openreach side of the business BT had a net loss of 68,000 connections, a reversal of a recent trend of slowing losses. This will be a concern and a figure to watch going forward. Dorset adds, though, that BT has benefited from its price rises being linked to inflation, which led to hefty increases. “Crucially, BT has been able to maintain a competitive position in the market due to prices being inflation linked. Given competitors do the same there is no real threat of customer churn there and it should be supportive for earnings. Finally, as interest rates have risen at an extraordinary pace, the debt burden facing alternative providers will be good news for BT. While it is a business in transformation, it has a good mix of short and long-term opportunities to take advantage of.” The market isn’t very impressed with BT either. Shares in the company dropped up to 10% in early trading, the biggest faller on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. As well as announcing up to 55,000 job cuts, BT also reported a 1% drop in revenue for the year to 31st March. Reported profit before tax fell 12% to £1.7bn, which BT blamed on “increased depreciation from network build and specific items, partially offset by adjusted EBITDA growth”. BT shares fell as low as 133.2p, from 148.1p last night, the lowest since early February. Shares in Royal Mail’s parent company are among biggest early fallers on the London Stock market, after its results this morning. International Distribution Services have dropped by 4.5% on the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies, after being pulled into a £748m full-year loss by Royal Mail’s woes. Unions are alarmed by BT’s plans to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030. John Ferrett, national secretary of Prospect (which represents thousands of managers at BT) says workers will be very unsettled by the announcement. “Prospect are deeply concerned by the scale of these cuts. Announcing such a huge reduction in this way will be very unsettling for workers who did so much to keep the country connected during the pandemic. “As a union we want to see the details behind this announcement in order to understand how it will impact upon members and have demanded an urgent meeting with the Chief Executive. It’s important that job cuts are voluntary, Ferrett adds: “We have always opposed compulsory redundancies in BT and has been able to ensure over the years that any reductions have been achieved on a voluntary basis. “Prospect has a partnership agreement with BT which governs how the company and the union manage change in the organisation. “We will be ensuring that the partnership agreement is fully adhered to during any consultations with BT over job reductions.” BT’s jobs cuts announcement comes just two days after Vodafone announced it would cut 11,000 positions worldwide, the largest reduction in its history. UK telco BT is planning to cut up to 55,000 jobs by 2030, as it pushes to become a ‘leaner business’. BT Group, the UK’s largest broadband and mobile provider, has declared it will reduce its workforce by tens of thousands of jobs by the end of the decade. BT says it will cut its “total labour resource” (it’s own workforce, and those employed by third parties) from 130,000 today to between 75,000 and 90,000 by the 2030 financial year. Chief executive Philip Jansen says BT will rely on a much smaller workforce, reducing its cust base, once it has completing the rollout of its new fibre broadband network. Jansen says: “By continuing to build and connect like fury, digitise the way we work and simplify our structure, by the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller workforce and a significantly reduced cost base. New BT Group will be a leaner business with a brighter future.” Jansen also says BT’s Openreach operation, which maintains its network, is competing strongly, and “it’s clear that customers love full fibre”. The Openreach Board has reaffirmed its target to reach 25 million premises with FTTP [Ultrafast Full Fibre broadband] by the end of 2026 and plans to further accelerate take-up on the network Despite reporting a £1bn loss this morning, Keith Williams, the chair of Royal Mail, argues there are reasons to be optimistic. Williams says Royal Mail is sorry that it hasn’t delivered a better service, and insists that the universal service obligation must be reformed. Williams tells the City: “I said before that we had reached a crossroads at Royal Mail. Now that we have a negotiators agreement with CWU that will shortly go out to ballot, and thanks to the good progress made on our five-point plan to stabilise Royal Mail, our destination is coming into sight.” “There is now a clear path towards a more competitive and profitable Royal Mail, delivering improved services for our customers whilst further reducing our environmental impact. Importantly, if ratified, the CWU agreement provides greater job security and increased rewards - through both pay and profit share - for our employees. Successful delivery of the agreement will be key.” “Quality of service has been significantly affected by industrial action and high levels of absence. I am sorry that we have not delivered the high standards of service our customers expect. Improving quality of service is our top priority.” “GLS has a proven track record of growth, solid margins and cash generation. During 2022-23 it delivered a robust performance in a tough macro-economic climate. Its flexible operating model, balanced B2C and B2B portfolio, diversified geographic exposure and continued investment have underpinned good progress this year and we continue to invest for long-term growth and margin accretion.” “So as we enter 2023-24 we have grounds for optimism. The economic climate remains challenging, and Royal Mail faces the task of rebuilding business from the damage caused by industrial action. To do this successfully and plan for the long term, urgent reform of the Universal Service Obligation is essential. Our plan is to return to group profitability this year but also seize the opportunity for both businesses to deliver ongoing profits thereafter, to the benefit of both our employees, customers and shareholders.” Royal Mail has reported a loss of over one billion pounds, after a year hit by strikes and poor delivery performance. Parent company International Distributions Services has reported that Royal Mail made a loss of £1.044bn in the year to March, down from a profit of £250m a year earlier. IDS says Royal Mail was hit by industrial action, with workers holding a string of strikes in the last year in a bitter dispute over pay and conditions. IDS blames Royal Mail’s inability to deliver “the in-year benefits of planned productivity improvements”. Weaker online shopping, and a drop in volumes of Covid-19 kits, also hit Royal Mail’s earnings compared with a year ago. IDS warns that the UK’s Universal Service Obligation (USO) – which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to every address in the land if necessary – “requires major reform”. It tells shareholders this morning: We urge the Government to work with us to protect the long-term sustainability of the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service. Earlier this week, communications regulator Ofcom launched an investigation into poor performance at Royal Mail that could lead to a fine. after more than a quarter of first-class mail was not delivered on time. Earlier this year, a cyber attack forced Royal Mail to temporarily suspend international parcel and letter deliveries through Post Office branches for several weeks. The company’s international parcels business, GLS, made an operating profit of £296m, down 9.5%, today’s financial results show. But overall, IDS has made a loss of £748m, down from a £577m profit the year earlier. Last week, Royal Mail’s CEO Simon Thompson quit, after the acrimonious tussle with unions, but will stay on until the end of October. On an adjusted basis, Royal Mail made an operating loss of £419m, beating market expectations according to Reuters. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. European carmakers have joined the push to delay post-Brexit rules on where parts are sourced from, amid fears that the future of the British automotive industry is at stake. As we covered yesterday, Vauxhaul owner Stellantis, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover all called on the UK government to renegotiate the Brexit deal, to change “rules of origin” terms. Currently, electric vehicles shipped between the UK and the EU will incur a 10% tariff unless at least 40% of their parts are sourced from within the two regions. That proportion is due to rise to 45% next year, which is a problem for electric carmakers as most electric vehicle batteries are still imported from Asia. The European trade group for the car industry is calling for a delay extension to this phase-in of tougher post-Brexit trade rules. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warns that supply chains, particularly electric vehicle batteries, are not ready. An ACEA spokesperson expained: “There has been massive investment in European battery supply chains. “The capacity to meet these rules of origin will come, but just not in the next few years. ACEA has requested that the current phase-in period for battery rules is extended by three years.” VDA, the German car industry lobby group, has weighed in in support, the Financial Times reports today. VDA said “we must urgently make adjustments” to the agreement, as Europe’s battery industry had not developed fast enough. Otherwise, they fear that tariffs would place… “a significant competitive disadvantage for the European car industry in relation to its Asian competitors in the so important UK market”. Also coming up today Water companies have apologised for repeated sewage spills and pledged to invest £10bn this decade in an attempt to quell public anger over pollution in seas and rivers. The companies will triple their existing investment plans to plough funds into the biggest modernisation of sewers “since the Victorian era” to reduce spills of overflowing sewage into England’s waterways. Industry body Water UK said the plans will cut the number of overflow incidents by up to 140,000 each year by 2030, compared with 2020. But the costs will ultimately be recouped from customers through higher bills, adding to the cost of living pressures in coming years. MPs are heading to the Bank of England to grill the central bank’s top brass this morning. The Treasury Committee plan to quiz governor Andrew Bailey on the Boe’s government bond-buying stimulus scheme (quantitative easing, or QE) and its role pushing up inflation, and how it will be unwound (quantitative tightening, or QT). Yesterday, Bailey pledged to lift interest rates as far “as necessary” to get inflation back to the bank’s 2% target. European stock markets are set to open higher, on hopes that the US debt ceiling deadlock will be broken, avoiding a US default. Joe Biden and the Republican speaker of the US House, Kevin McCarthy, said on Wednesday they thought a deal to avoid a US debt default was in reach.

What cavern of loneliness took a woman who ruled her world into the arms of Wagga Wagga wide boy Daryl Maguire? The Hay Plains grifter. A man whose nearly 20-year political career saw him never considered for a ministry or even the wastelands of a shadow ministerial role. The relentless eye of Icac unearthed phone taps in which Maguire insisted: “Even when you are the Premier, I am the boss, all right?” “Yes,” she said repeatedly. “I know.” The anti-corruption commission introduced the phone tape evidence to argue the former premier was indeed in thrall to this hillbilly huckster, sufficiently to set aside her public responsibilities to please him. “I impress a lot of people,” says Maguire on the tape. “Why aren’t you impressed in front of people? You should be.” The secret relationship lasted five years until it was upended by the commission’s investigation. “I’ll throw money at Wagga,” Berejiklian told Maguire during one taped conversation. “I’m batting for you.” Her eagerness to please him shines on the tapes. “I’ve already got you the Wagga hospital,” she assures him. “I just spoke to Dom [Perrottet] and I just said put the 140 in the budget and he goes ‘no worries’. He just does what I ask him to, so it’s fine.” NSW bureaucrats had not supported a $5.5m pitch for an Australian Clay Target Association facility in Maguire’s electorate. Without disclosing her “close, personal relationship” with Maguire, Berejiklian worked to overturn that decision, putting her “in a position of conflict of interest between her public duty and her private interest”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Similarly, a $10m grant to the Riverina Conservatorium of Music “breached public trust” because Berejiklian was “influenced by the existence of a close personal relationship with Mr Maguire, or by a desire on her part to maintain or advance that relationship”. Criminal? No. The Icac expressly notes that it will not be sending a brief of evidence against the former premier to the director of public prosecutions. The relevant criminal charge would be “misconduct in public office”. Icac’s “corrupt conduct” finding does not automatically trigger a criminal process. That makes it difficult for Berejiklian to overturn the finding. The report, she says, “is currently being examined by my legal team”. The commission’s many critics say the report’s long gestation, and the designation of “corrupt” despite there being no prospect of a criminal conviction, deprive Berejiklian and others of natural justice. It’s different for Maguire, who faces new potential charges to add to those he’s fighting over an alleged cash-for-visas scheme. Two of his business associates have also been recommended for charges. The report found Maguire sought to exploit his position to “enrich himself” for years before his relationship with Berejiklian began. It allegedly continued while they were together. Berejiklian’s failure to report “reasonable suspicions” about Maguire’s alleged corruption itself constituted “grave misconduct”, said Icac. During the Icac hearing, Berejiklian defended her impulse to pour money into Wagga Wagga. “I don’t think it would be a surprise to anybody that we throw money at seats to keep them.” Her fundamental line remains unchanged. “At all times I have worked my hardest in the public interest. Nothing in this report demonstrates otherwise,” says her statement. The Liberal shadow attorney general, Alister Henskens, stressed “there is no finding of any pecuniary benefit” to the former premier. A brief statement from Optus gives no suggestion her executive career there is in any danger. Her public standing is reduced rather than destroyed. Berejiklian says the public’s “incredible support … will sustain me always”. Villain? Victim? Corrupt or crucified? Her saga demonstrates that corruption commissions are powerful things. And that in politics even more than normal life, you need to pick your partners well.

The Pacific country is waiting for its president to recall parliament so lawmakers can vote for a new prime minister after a national election showed no party received a clear majority. A coalition of three parties say they have a combined majority and have agreed on the People’s Alliance leader, Sitiveni Rabuka, as prime minister. Fiji First and the incumbent prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, have not conceded defeat. Both men have led coups in the past. Opposition parties have disputed reports – cited by police and Bainimarama as reason to bring in the military – that businesses or homes of Fiji’s large ethnic Indian population have been targeted or stoned in the wake of the election. The opposition groups have called for evidence of this. At a media conference on Thursday, the National Federation party leader, Biman Prasad, said Fiji First’s secretary general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, who was the attorney general in Bainimarama’s government, was “trying to create fear in the minds of people” and should accept the election result. “He is not accepting they lost this election, people voted for change,” Prasad said. The police commissioner, Sitiveni Qiliho, said a decision had been made to call in the military after he met with Bainimarama as well as the minister for defence and policing, Inia Seruiratu, and the military commander, Maj Gen Jone Kalouniwai. “We came to an agreement for RFMF personnel to assist police with the maintenance of law and order, amidst growing concerns of racial tension,” a statement published on Thursday read. Qiliho said the decision was based on reports received that “minority groups continue to be targeted and information of planned civil unrest received”. The police commissioner also cited “threats made against minority groups who are now living in fear following recent political developments”. “While the army and navy personnel have been called in to assist, police will continue to lead the overall security operations,” he added. Bainimarama issued a statement saying the military had been deployed to complement the police in maintaining law and order. “The reports of harassment suffered by our citizens and violence targeted at Indo-Fijian homes and businesses in the wake of the election are deeply disturbing,” he said in a Facebook post. Fiji’s president, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere, has until 2 January to summon parliament, media outlet Fiji Village reported, citing a letter sent by Katonivere to the coalition partners. The prime minister must be voted in by more than 50% of lawmakers on the parliament floor. Bainimarama and Rabuka were initially deadlocked after the election. Rabuka’s People’s Alliance Party won 21 seats and the affiliated National Federation Party won five seats, while Bainimarama’s Fiji First party secured 26 seats. That left Sodelpa, which won three seats, holding the balance of power. The party decided on Tuesday in a close 16-14 internal vote to go with Rabuka – a vote that Fiji First is now questioning. The Pacific island country, with a population of 900,000, had a history of military coups before constitutional reform in 2013 to remove a race-based voting system that favoured indigenous Fijians over ethnic Indians. In 2006, Bainimarama instigated a coup and was installed as prime minister the year after, before leading Fiji First to majority government at the 2014 and 2018 democratic elections. Rabuka is a former prime minister who instigated a coup in 1987 before bringing back democratic elections in 1992 and led the country through to 1999. The Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), a power-broker holding three seats in the hung parliament, supports policies favouring indigenous Fijians, and on Tuesday signed a coalition agreement with Rabuka’s People’s Alliance and the National Federation Party. However Sodelpa’s board must meet again, after the validity of the decision to back the coalition was challenged by the party’s general secretary and Fiji’s supervisor of elections. Sayed-Khaiyum, from the governing Fiji First party, lashed out at Rabuka, accusing him of sowing division in Fiji. “The entire rationale of this man has been to divide Fiji to gain political supremacy,” Sayed-Khaiyum said. “And we can see that simmering through again. In fact it’s not simmering, it’s boiling.” A day earlier, Rabuka and two other party leaders announced they were forming a coalition with a total of 29 seats against Fiji First’s 26 and would form the next government. “A government we hope that will bring the change that people had been calling out for over the last few years,” Rabuka said at a news conference. “It’s going to be an onerous task. It will not be easy, and it was never easy to try and dislodge an incumbent government. We have done that, collectively.” Rabuka’s announcement had prompted the New Zealand foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, to send her congratulations on Twitter, saying New Zealand “looks forward to working together to continue strengthening our warm relationship”. But the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, took a more cautious approach, saying she was waiting until the dust settled.

The Oxford English Dictionary added 26 Korean words. The K-pop band BTS has topped charts internationally and met Joe Biden at the White House this summer. After sweeping through Asia years ago, hallyu – the “Korean wave” of culture – has crashed upon western shores too, as documented in a new exhibition at the V&amp;A in London. This is a serious business. A recent book, Shrimp to Whale, plays on an old saying portraying Korea as a tiny creature surrounded by leviathans and captures its triumphant postwar ascent from abject poverty and trauma. South Korea still regards itself as a middle power. But in economics, technology and especially culture it is now a powerhouse. One government source jokes that soft power – a country’s ability to get what it wants through attraction rather than coercion or payment – is the South’s nuclear weapon. Joseph Nye, who coined the term soft power in the late 1980s, has suggested that it depends on a nation’s culture, political values and foreign policies. Building it is not as straightforward as amassing the bombs and tanks required for hard power. China has invested heavily in soft-power initiatives, but has yet to produce a Blackpink or Snowpiercer. Its determination to micromanage cultural projects hampers the ability to appeal to foreign audiences. (Prof Nye has suggested that its influence will remain limited for as long as it “fans the flames of nationalism and holds tight the reins of party control”). In contrast, democratic South Korea has pursued an arm’s-length approach, modelled partly on UK initiatives such as the British Council. Squid Game and the Oscar-winning Parasite hardly shed a flattering light on the nation that produced them: they have triumphed by capturing the monstrous cruelties and inequality of modern capitalism there, in a way that has resonated more widely. The strategy is a recognition that soft power belongs to nations, not governments. The origins of South Korea’s status as a cultural behemoth are complex. But if the state can take some credit, civil society should take more. There was outrage in 2016 when it emerged that then-president Park Geun-hye’s administration had blacklisted thousands of artists and entertainers – a reversion to the kind of censorship and punishment once seen under authoritarian leaders, including Ms Park’s father. It is the people who have nurtured, promoted and defended media and artistic independence. Globally, this is an era in which diplomatic platitudes have been stripped away, and force laid bare once more. Nationalist strongmen are in charge around the world. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was the ultimate assertion of hard power. Yet the video addresses by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has so consummately inhabited the role of war leader; the sharing of daily life by citizens; even the defiant humour of postage stamps have all helped to bolster public support for Ukraine in other countries. In doing so, they have helped to maintain the political will to keep supplying it with heavy weaponry in the face of Russian menace. Soft power is hard to define and harder to master. But it counts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T01:29:33Z","webTitle":"Macron calls Putin over fears Russia is weaponising captured nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/ukraine-fears-russian-plan-to-cut-power-from-captured-nuclear-plant","fields":{"bodyText":"France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said Russia may plan to decouple the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from the Ukrainian power grid, backing up warnings from Ukraine’s own nuclear power firm. Macron spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday and said the call was necessary because of the urgent nuclear threat to Europe. Putin agreed to allow independent inspectors to go to the plant, Macron’s office said, and had “reconsidered” allowing the mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency to travel to the facility from Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian nuclear firm Energoatom said on Friday that it feared that Russia plans to switch off the functioning power units at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which in normal times provides about one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. Russia has controlled the plant in south-east Ukraine since March, although it is still run by Ukrainian scientists. If it stopped generating electricity, its technicians would have to rely on backup power systems to continue cooling the nuclear reactors, which raises the risk of accidents. “The Russian military is looking for suppliers of fuel for diesel generators, which must be turned on after the shutdown of power units and in the absence of external power supply for nuclear-fuel cooling systems,” Energoatom said. Western officials said they were concerned about whether water cooling could be maintained, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. “[It is] a situation we should all be watching very closely,” said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost in an earthquake, a tsunami that followed overwhelmed backup generators, and the lack of cooling led to a partial reactor meltdown. Russia has controlled the plant, which is the largest nuclear power station in Europe, since March and stationed troops and military equipment there, leading to urgent calls for it to be demilitarised, including from the UN and Nato. The western official said fighting around the plant was considered a lesser risk than a cooling failure, because the nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impact, including that from a passenger jet. On Friday Putin renewed Russian accusations that Ukraine was shelling the site, and in the phone call with Macron he said it could lead to “a large-scale catastrophe that could lead to radiation contamination of vast territories”, the Kremlin said in a statement. Ukrainian military intelligence had warned this week that Moscow appeared to be planning a “provocation” at the plant, and Energoatom also raised concerns about unusual activity. On Friday while the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, visited the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Russia reportedly closed the Zaporizhzhia site to most personnel, apart from those operating the power units, Energoatom said. Energoatom also accused Russia of shelling parts of the plant complex in false flag attacks that Moscow blamed on Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s western allies have warned that any nuclear incident would provoke a swift response. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defence select committee, said on Friday that any nuclear accident at the site risked drawing Nato into the war. “Let’s make it clear now: ANY deliberate damage causing potential radiation leak to a Ukrainian nuclear reactor would be a breach of Nato’s Article 5,” he said on Twitter. Even if the reactors remain intact, however, Russia may plan to weaponise the plant simply by disconnecting it. With winter approaching, and Ukraine already concerned about gas supplies, the plant going offline could be damaging to the economy and people’s ability to stay warm. The power it provides would need to be generated at other plants, using up limited supplies of natural gas and other fuels, or the country could face blackouts. And excess heat from the plant is key to regional heating systems. The governor of Zaporizhzhia oblast, Oleksandr Starukh, has said that if the plant were to be disconnected, it would leave many of the city’s 700,000 residents without warmth in Ukraine’s bitter winter. “The heating system of the city is supplied by the nuclear power plant. So if they turn it off, there’s no way to heat [our buildings]”, he told the Guardian in June. “It’s just a huge problem.” Making a major change to operations of a nuclear plant in wartime is dangerous in itself, a senior Ukrainian energy official said. “The problem with Russia is that they’re so reckless,” said Yuriy Vitrenko, the chairman of the gas company Naftogaz, who described Russian actions as “insane”. “The nuclear regulator would usually need require you to test something to prove that it’s absolutely safe … it’s not like you cannot experiment with a nuclear power plant. And what they’re doing now is really against all the norms.” He said Russia did not fully understand the plant, which is from the Soviet era but has been extensively modernised. That meant the Russian regulator and Russian engineers were not fully up to date on how it works, he said. “They can come and see but again, it’s not their plant, so they don’t know everything they need to know about how it operates and what can and should be done with this plant,” he said.

America’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed just over a year ago, will pour at least US$370bn (A$570bn) into clean energy programs. Groups such as the Clean Energy Council warn the program “has the potential to permanently tilt the scales toward the US and hamper our progress in Australia”. “In the global energy transition, the best talent will be mobile,” the council’s chief executive, Kane Thornton, said. “The success of our own energy transition relies on making the case that Australia is an attractive place to call home and our commitment to renewable energy is solid.” Jane MacMaster, the chief engineer at Engineers Australia, said the looming skills shortage was raised by many speakers at an energy transition summit in Sydney last week. “It’s a fantastic time to be an engineer but it’s also a very busy time,” MacMaster said. “There’s definitely a challenge in the supply of the engineering workforce at the moment, and it’s pretty much across all sectors and almost all disciplines of the profession.” MacMaster said the IRA was drawing US engineers home as well as those from elsewhere. Several nations were considering launching countermeasures that could further challenge the appeal of working in Australia. “Australia is competing with other countries [and] our states are competing with each other,” she said. A confluence of national priorities – from transitioning to net zero emissions, to building up sovereign manufacturing capability including for nuclear submarines – was stoking the need for engineers and other technology workers. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “We need 60,000 more graduate engineers in the next 10 years just to replace … the engineers that we think will retire”, MacMaster said. Local universities now only produce about 7,500 four-year graduates annually, many of whom get snapped up by banks or management consultancies. The IRA’s impact on Australia’s renewables race is ill-timed. The Australian Energy Market Operator this week said 62% of the coal-fired power stations in the national electricity market were forecast to close by 2033, requiring “imminent and urgent investment” in new energy sources. Major projects that are under way, such as the now $12bn Snowy Hydro 2.0 pumped hydro plan, have also struggled with complexity and cost overruns. Developers such as Transgrid, which is building the now $5bn HumeLink to connect Snowy 2.0 to the main power grid, are hoping the federal government’s $20bn Rewiring the Nation plan will bolster Australia’s chances in a global race for skilled labour, material and equipment. “Many major infrastructure projects are under way across Australia, which is squeezing limited resources,” a Transgrid spokesperson said. “As the demand for clean energy continues to grow, the ongoing transformation of our energy system requires an urgent focus on upskilling tens of thousands of workers to address skills shortages,” he said. Transgrid alone expects to require hundreds of electrical design, commissioning, civil and asset engineers over the next five to 10 years. The company is investing millions of dollars in training and development and partnering with Charles Sturt and Newcastle universities to help meet demand, he said. MacMaster said her organisation detailed the issues facing the profession last year. Only about 60% of the 400,000 or so qualified engineers in Australia work in an engineering role. Australia has long relied on importing engineers, with about 62% of those qualified born overseas. In the past five years, 82,000 of the 115,000 additional engineering jobs – or 71% – were filled by overseas talent. MacMaster said the number of students studying intermediate or advanced maths was in steep decline while the standard of maths education was also on the skids. Australia had also dropped from 13th in the 38-nation OECD’s program for international student assessment in 2003 to 30th by 2018, she said. Women, too, only made up about 18% of student engineers and 14% of the qualified engineering workforce, underscoring one area of potential future growth. Australia may also fill some of the gaps by hiring more engineering technologists, with three-year degrees, or two-year engineering associates. “It’s a bit of a win-win situation – for those people who aren’t necessarily inclined to study as advanced levels of maths as required of professional engineers,” MacMaster said. “But we need industry to create the demand for them to incentivise more [universities] to offer these places.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jul/09/labour-promises-tory-mismanagement-public-finances","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-09T09:00:41Z","webTitle":"False hope is even worse than no hope.

Local headteachers I respect and admire were in tears as they described the challenges they are grappling with. The owner of a popular local chippy showed me his energy bill, up from £5,000 a quarter to £11,000, as he shared his fears for his business. A parent showed me a photo of his straight-A son beaten black and blue in the middle of his GCSEs and shared his frustration that he has put more work into the investigation than the police. People are increasingly looking to Labour to get Britain out of this mess. Last week Keir Starmer set out the fifth of Labour’s five missions for government: to smash the class ceiling that holds back kids from working-class backgrounds like mine. Taken together with our ambition to build an NHS fit for the future out of the ashes of the worst crisis in its history, to make our streets safe, to deliver clean power by 2030 and to get our economy racing ahead of the world, with the benefits shared so that we’re all better off, Keir’s missions amount to an ambitious vision of what our country can look like in the 2030s. Labour faces two big hurdles – both largely of the Conservatives’ making, both of which will make our job more difficult. The first is the car crash of the public finances. The Conservatives’ ideological joyride of a budget last year has left everyone paying the price through higher rents, higher mortgages and higher bills. Keir and Rachel Reeves face tougher choices than Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in 1997. As Keir said in his conference speech in September, this means there will be good Labour things we want to do but won’t be able to promise. We face a huge deficit of trust in politics too. It’s a far bigger problem for us than it is for the Tories. As Britain’s progressive party, Labour is where people turn when they believe things can get better. When cynicism wins, so do the Tories. It falls to us to win public confidence in the Labour party and in the ability of politics to be a force for good. That’s why we are being so careful to only make promises we know we can keep. The only thing worse than no hope is false hope. It will disappoint some of our friends that we are not pledging support for every cause they believe in. But it would be so much more damaging to make promises now and then break them after the election. Ask the Lib Dems what far-fetched promises on tuition fees did for them. As shadow health secretary I have a challenging public service brief. It is not always easy being unable to pull the spending lever. But that is exactly why Keir and Rachel are right to prioritise economic growth, because that’s the only way we are going to be able to give the NHS and other public services the investment they need. Imagine Britain leading the G7 with the highest sustained economic growth, with a million more jobs in green energy, with an NHS fit for the future, safe streets and a trusted justice system, and with every child, whatever their background, having the best start in life. That will be Labour’s platform at the next general election, and because we are making the hard choices necessary for government, it will be a platform you can trust us to deliver. • Wes Streeting is shadow health secretary and MP for Ilford North"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-19T17:02:24Z","webTitle":"‘A feminist symbol’: how the humble ponytail scored a summer winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/aug/19/a-feminist-symbol-how-the-humble-ponytail-scored-a-summer-winner","fields":{"bodyText":"Reaching the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday is, of course, a massive achievement for England, writes Lauren Cochrane. But the team also have another important distinction to enjoy – they have helped make the humble ponytail the hairstyle of the summer. Celebrating Alessia Russo’s goal on Wednesday against Australia, ponytails swung from the heads of most of the team – from Russo herself to fellow goal scorers Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone, as well as Chloe Kelly, Georgia Stanway, Alex Greenwood and Rachel Daly. While the hairstyle is no doubt a practical measure to ensure hair is kept away from the face while playing football, the ponytail has taken precedence over equally serviceable buns and shorter hair during this tournament. The fact that it is the hairstyle also worn by busy women across the world everyday has helped some of those watching identify with the players. “The ponytail is a feminist symbol,” said Jacqueline Kilikita, acting beauty director of Refinery29, a US-based lifestyle website. “It indicates power and confidence – showing your face to the world and getting things done in style.” The England team are not the only template for the ponytail this summer: Margot Robbie as Barbie wears a high ponytail and has inspired others to try the same look. There have been more than 132m views of videos with the hashtag #barbieponytail on TikTok, and Pinterest has reported that searches for “Barbie ponytail” went up 190% from January to April. “Sport and Barbie could be seen at opposite ends of the spectrum, but a blond ponytail is fusing the two together in a very satisfying unity,” said Tom Smith, hairstylist and trend forecaster. If the style had previously been seen as only for those with Caucasian hair, it has been embraced by women of colour this summer. Black women on TikTok have gone viral with their takes on the Barbie ponytail. In the England squad, star striker Lauren James, who was still suspended for last Wednesday’s game against Australia, also wears a ponytail style with her textured hair. “It’s more popular than ever and great for those who prefer a lower- maintenance hairstyle that requires little to no styling,” said Tina Farey, the editorial director of Rush, a hair and beauty company. “Although simple, it still looks chic and classy.”Ponytails have a long history, dating back to ancient Greece, and taking in soldiers in the 18th century, French film star Brigitte Bardot in the 1960s and Janet Jackson and Madonna in the 1990s. Kilikita said that the recent ponytail revival is part of a wider trend for looking back. “I think the ponytail’s comeback has been a long time coming, considering our love for nostalgic hairstyles,” she said. “I associate it with my school days.” It has, she added, “usurped the messy 90s bun as the hairstyle of the summer”. To achieve a ponytail worthy of the England team, Smith recommends hair that is not freshly washed and adding dry shampoo. “An easy hack I teach my clients is to do it in two stages: first, just [put up] the hair over your crown in a ponytail, then join up the remainder,” he said. “It gives loads of extra volume and allows you to pull out the edges, getting it less flat to your head without making the ponytail slip.” As for those in the England team, Kilikita has a theory on how their ponytails stay in place: “I think it’s a good hair elastic – or a hair bungee, a professional hair tie enlisted by the very best hairstylists – a large paddle brush and lots of gel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-01T05:20:25Z","webTitle":"TV tonight: a powerful end to one of the best new cop shows in ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/01/tv-tonight-a-powerful-end-to-one-of-the-best-new-cop-shows-in-ages","fields":{"bodyText":"Blue Lights 9pm, BBC One After last week’s Operation Farset disaster, the final episode is spent praying for Gerry (Richard Dormer) to pull through – and it’s a powerful end to what has been an excellent new cop show.

Russia’s permanent representative to the body, Vasily Nebenzya, told Interfax on Friday that Moscow must “protect” the Zaporizhzhia plant. A withdrawal of its troops would make the facility “vulnerable … to provocations and terrorist attacks”, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had earlier called for all military personnel and equipment to be pulled out, saying the plant “should not be used as part of any military operations” and a demilitarised zone needed to be agreed. Both the US and France backed Guterres’ appeal. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, said officials must visit the plant as soon as possible. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour,” Grossi told the UN security council. Ukraine and Russia on Friday accused each other of risking nuclear catastrophe at the plant, which lies on the opposite bank of a reservoir from several Ukrainian-held towns and cities that have come under intense shelling from the Russian-held side. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said Ukraine was shelling the plant itself. “They say it’s Russia,” he wrote on Telegram. “That’s obviously 100% nonsense, even for the stupid Russophobic public.” Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, added: “They say it happens purely by chance, like ‘we didn’t mean to’. What can I say? Let’s not forget that the European Union also has nuclear power plants. And accidents can happen there, too.” Ukraine’s Energoatom agency, whose workers still operate the plant under Russian occupation, said it was struck five times on Thursday, including near where radioactive materials are stored. Kyiv said Russian troops struck it themselves, and were also using the plant as a shield to provide cover while they bombard nearby Ukrainian-held towns and cities. “The Ukrainian armed forces do not damage the infrastructure [of the plant], do not strike where there may be a danger on a global scale,” the army spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told national television. “We understand that the invaders are hiding behind such a shield because it is not possible to strike there.” Earlier this week, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, in the knowledge it would be too dangerous for Ukraine to return fire. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, demanded Russia return the plant to Ukraine’s control. “Only a full withdrawal of the Russians … and the restoration of full Ukrainian control of the situation around the station can guarantee a resumption of nuclear security for all of Europe,” he said in his latest video address. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, has previously warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster, he said, adding that “such insane actions could lead to … a Fukushima or Chornobyl”. Grossi said he was ready to lead an international expert mission to inspect the site in south-eastern Ukraine and called on Russia and Ukraine to cooperate so officials could travel as soon as possible. “Time is of the essence,” he told the 15-member security council late on Thursday, adding that the agency could perform urgent work on safeguards and provide a stabilising influence in order “to prevent a nuclear accident”. Fighting has intensified in recent days in anticipation of what Ukraine says is a planned counteroffensive in the south. The country’s general staff on Friday reported shelling and air attacks by Russian forces on scores of towns and bases. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the eastern Donetsk region, said on Telegram seven civilians had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours. Britain’s defence ministry said on Friday that explosions earlier this week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea were “almost certainly” the result of the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas. It did not say what the exact cause of the blasts was but said at least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets appeared to have been destroyed or seriously damaged. The airfield itself, while seriously damaged, probably remained serviceable, the report added. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack or explained how it was carried out. Russia has denied aircraft were damaged and said the explosions at the base were accidental."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-25T08:00:28Z","webTitle":"The nuclear threat might change the mood in Russia itself, stoking widespread fear | Peter Pomerantsev","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/25/nuclear-threat-might-change-the-mood-in-russia-itself-stoking-widespread-fear","fields":{"bodyText":"‘Do you want Total War?” Goebbels demanded of the Nazi faithful as the Second World War went south for Germany in 1943. He depicted a Reich surrounded by evil Jewish cosmopolitan conspirators bent on its destruction and he advocated for total mobilisation and to embrace a glory-in-death ideology. Vladimir Putin delivered his own (partial) version last week. As the Ukraine war goes south for Russia, he claimed the defeats are the result of cosmopolitan conspiracies bent on destroying Russia and he had to announce (partial) total mobilisation. He called on Russians’ sense of historical mission and implied Russia was ready to use nuclear weapons. “This isn’t a bluff,” he insisted. Putin likes to imitate the worst of 20th-century totalitarian propaganda, but does his message work, at home and abroad? Or is Putin starting to make the same propaganda blunders he made on the battlefield? Russian state propaganda drips with the pathos of martyrdom. Russians are meant to love the pain of proving how tough they are, surviving everything from the Gulag to the extreme weather, as compared with the effete west. The propaganda taps incessantly into the myth of the Second World War, in which Russians are described as unique among nations in their readiness to sacrifice themselves for a greater cause. On the anniversary of that war, the state organises marches where people carry placards of dead veterans, “the immortal regiment”: death in war brings immortality in the heaven of state propaganda. There’s a suicidal bravura, a “let’s destroy the whole world” implication in the popular catchphrase “What’s the point of the world if there’s no place for Russia in it?”. Putin’s nuclear threats are snarled with relish, as if sadistically summoning the Gods of Total Destruction. As with the Nazis, rational self-interest is meant to be swallowed up in the community of the state. But look closer and the picture gets more complicated – and vulnerable. The myth of martyrdom and resilience is suspect. Ukrainians have a genuine tradition of suffering for the cause of national liberation – and success through sacrifice. For centuries, Ukrainian poets and rebels proved themselves ready to bear unjust imprisonment, executions and genocide to fight for their national and linguistic rights. Many of Ukraine’s heroes, such as the poets Taras Shevchenko and Vasyl Stus, suffered Russian prisons and tortures, and their underlying spirit of resilience is being proved on the battlefield. Russians have indeed been killed en masse, most often by their own state, but, unlike Ukrainians, they do not celebrate their own dissidents. These are hated and damned in state propaganda and by the public at large. Real courage is derided. Instead, mass oppression has resulted in a society that celebrates passive conformism. Bravura is celebrated on the screen, but as a way to compensate for the way society is actually cowed. You are crushed by the state and then compensated with patriotic heroics on television and sadism towards the weakest in your own society and others (in this case, Ukraine). The great difference with Nazi propaganda is that while the former was geared to action and mobilisation, Putin’s propaganda is geared to demobilisation: sit on the couch, feel strong by watching propaganda and let the Kremlin run things. Beneath the rhetoric of self-sacrifice, Putin’s propaganda has traditionally allowed for self-interest or, at least, self-preservation. You go to war spouting patriotic rhetoric, but really you are in it because it allows for loot and rape. You enjoy the highs of patriotic rhetoric at home, but really your interest is in being allowed to pursue corruption, great and small. Putin’s trick is to dress self-interest in patriotic propaganda. Now those two things are splitting. Going to the front just means pointless death. It’s now clear the “partial” mobilisation is not partial at all; people are being grabbed on the streets and packed off to war. On social media, the sentiment towards mobilisation is highly negative. In polling, even the most pro-Putin Russians are against it. The war in Ukraine was meant to be a movie, not a personal sacrifice. Putin’s threat of nuclear war may backfire, too. It’s meant to intimidate the west and Ukraine but it can upset his own people more. If there’s one thing Russians fear more than Putin, it’s nuclear war – and now he’s the one bringing it closer. For both the elite and the “ordinary” Russians who I’ve spoken to recently, the calculation is about whether the risk of going against Putin is bigger than the risk of sticking with him. So far, rebelling has seemed the bigger risk; does the nuclear topic change that? Much depends on how the international community reacts. We need to show that the closer he gets to a nuclear threat, the more devastating the reaction will be: military, economic and diplomatic. He will even lose China. Losing public opinion in Russia is not the same as in a democracy. It doesn’t necessarily lead to protests, let alone losing non-existent elections. But being able to show you can control public opinion, through fear and propaganda, is one of the emblems of tsardom. Putin has lost control of the military situation. Losing control of propaganda will show that beneath the shiny fascist boots are feet of clay. Now stamp on them. • Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: Adventures in Modern Russia Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a revealing quote during a meeting last week with about a hundred academics from 40 countries, Putin rejected it. Fyodor Lukyanov, a highly respected thinktank editor who was the meeting’s moderator, had the courage to ask the Russian president if he would retreat like the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev did in the 1962 Cuban crisis. “Certainly not,” Putin replied. To general laughter, according to the Kremlin transcript, he went on: “I cannot imagine myself in the role of Khrushchev. No way.” The amusement was presumably prompted not just by the physical and attitudinal contrast between Putin, the cold disciplinarian and fitness freak, and Khrushchev, the pot-bellied and jolly reformer who ruled Russia erratically after Stalin’s death. Everyone remembered how Khrushchev was dumped out of power by his colleagues two years after the Cuban adventure. Putin’s comment leaves us facing the bleakest of scenarios. We now have no prospect of unilateral Russian retreat. It comes on top of the grim reality that there is no basis for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since Putin made the stupid mistake in September of annexing four Ukrainian provinces, thereby undermining any chance of mutual concessions and an agreed pull-back, since the Russian parliament now considers the regions part of Russia. As the fighting has intensified, both sides have increased their demands and hardened their positions. Back in March, a month after the Russian invasion, a deal was possible. Putin had recognised his dispatch of troops to occupy Kyiv and effect regime change had failed on the battlefield. Reports suggest Putin mainly wanted Ukraine to renounce its ambition to join Nato and accept autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk, in line with the Minsk agreements of 2015. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, was willing to consider Russia’s demands in exchange for a ceasefire and a Russian withdrawal, while the status of Crimea was left for later discussion. That did not happen. Enter Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, their interventions, and the sense that what had been a war to defend and restore Ukraine’s sovereignty had became a proxy war between the west and Russia. And at the back of it all lurks the nuclear mushroom cloud. Not since 1962 has the world been in such danger. The crisis of October 1962 was worse than today’s confrontation in one key respect. The working assumption was that any use of force by the US president, John F Kennedy, to stop Soviet ships carrying nuclear-tipped missiles to Cuba would quickly escalate into a launch of nuclear weapons at American and Soviet cities. Both superpowers put their arsenals on high alert. The world faced the existential threat of global suicide. In today’s crisis the talk is of using so-called tactical nuclear weapons. Tactical is an elastic concept, of course, and today’s US nuclear bombs, like the B61s that Biden is sending to US bases in Britain, are 30 times as powerful as the one dropped on Hiroshima. The Pentagon released the unclassified sections of its long-delayed Nuclear Posture Review last week. They show that efforts by arms control experts to persuade the Biden administration to support “no first use” have failed. The US will not abandon its longstanding readiness to escalate to the nuclear level and respond with nuclear weapons to a non-nuclear conventional attack. Russian doctrine is depressingly similar, and Putin has said he will use whatever weaponry is needed if Russian territory comes under attack. Biden has shown some restraint. He has resisted Ukrainian requests for long-range rockets that could hit Russian cities and provoke an all-out war between Russian and Nato forces. He has turned down Zelenskiy’s call for Nato to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He has not sent US troops to Ukraine, and made sure no other Nato country sends troops either. But even though the risks of a quick slide into all-out nuclear war are less today than in 1962, there are other dangers inherent in today’s crisis that make it more alarming. First among them is the absence of any negotiating forum or an agenda for mutual concessions. Both sides want military victory and are lured by the mirage that it is obtainable. There is not even a basis for a ceasefire, since each side is sure its opponent will use a truce to train more troops, obtain more weaponry and regroup its forces into better positions. In 1962 there was a relatively simple basis for de-escalating and resolving the crisis quickly. Khrushchev’s dispatch of nuclear missiles to Cuba was not prompted by strategic necessity or the need to defend Soviet territory. It was a gamble and an effort to achieve strategic parity with US power on the cheap. Faced with Kennedy’s determination to use force, Khrushchev could and did make a U-turn. To make it less humiliating for him, and give the impression of mutual concessions, Kennedy publicly pledged not to invade Cuba. He also agreed to withdraw the outdated medium-range Jupiter missiles that were deployed close to the Soviet border in Turkey. As a gesture of goodwill Khrushchev offered not to publicise this US concession. After 13 days of nail-biting tension, the 1962 crisis ended with a breath of common sense and statecraft on both sides. If only the same qualities could be revived over Ukraine today.

The prime minister used a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to provide an assurance that the government was “working around the clock to deliver a solution” and to flag collaboration with the states. “Just as we brought state and territory governments together to take urgent action to keep the lights on in our first month in office, I’m confident we will be able to reach agreement on a plan that delivers for every part of Australia,” Albanese said on Wednesday night. Guardian Australia revealed on Monday the Albanese government may struggle to provide comprehensive energy price relief unless NSW and Queensland cooperate with a plan to temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal. The government is looking at price cap options to assist industrial users of gas and households battling a surge in their power bills. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, briefed cabinet on the components of the proposed intervention on Monday, including possible price caps for gas and coal. The Albanese government is confident it has the regulatory levers to reduce gas prices for industrial users, but there is concern a replica intervention in the coal market might be more complex for Canberra to execute, and could open the possibility of legal challenges given producers will resist. Gas price relief can be achieved through tweaking existing federal mechanisms, such as the industry code of conduct, but interventions in the coal market are normally driven by the states. Reporting of the deliberation in Canberra prompted the Queensland premier to fire a public warning shot at Albanese. On Tuesday, she used an answer in state parliament to declare the federal government needed to keep “hands off our generators”. The energy package is still the subject of internal deliberations. Albanese is looking to land the long telegraphed regulatory intervention around the time of a looming national cabinet meeting in early December. Asked on ABC’s 7:30 about a gas price cap of $11 to $13 a gigajoule, Albanese said the government would “take action” by Christmas but he “won’t speculate on the figures that are floating around”. “What we’re determined to do is to undertake measures that put downward pressure on costs, whether that be for business or for households.” Albanese said the speculation of government intervention had already caused “some downward pressure”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In question time on Wednesday, the deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, labelled the energy policy “half baked”, and accused the industry minister, Ed Husic, of not being able to explain its details in a morning interview. Ley questioned if the government was “giving false hope to Australians about lowering power prices”. Albanese responded that her question was based on a “range of false premises” and defended Husic’s refusal to discuss detail by explaining he could not reveal cabinet discussions. “The second point I will make is: I love Queensland as well,” Albanese said, echoing Husic’s interview. “The cabinet is dealing with these issues. The minister for industry is diligently consulting with the manufacturing sector in particular.” Before his election in May Albanese promised to be pro-entrepreneurship and to listen, if not always agree, with business. Albanese’s relationship with the business sector has been tested by Labor’s ambitious secure jobs, better pay bill, and the inclusion of options for multi-employer pay deals. The bill prompted revolt from employer groups over a lack of safeguards preventing all but the smallest businesses being drawn into pay deals without their consent. Further safeguards for small and medium businesses were added as part of a deal with Senator David Pocock that was expected to guarantee the bill’s passage this week. Albanese told Acci on Wednesday evening he was “aware that there are elements of our plan with which you disagree”. “No significant economic reform has ever enjoyed 100% support.” Albanese argued that “one point of disagreement” on industrial relations need not “define our every interaction”. “Our relationship is bigger than that, more important than that. Consensus, in the end, depends on a common goal.” Albanese cited the common goals of “strong employment growth, higher incomes growth, improved productivity and enhanced social inclusion” agreed at the jobs and skills summit. He said government and business had made “substantial progress” in areas including vocational education, cheaper childcare, manufacturing, trade, and cleaner, cheaper energy. “We will continue to seek your cooperation, your insights and your expertise as we confront emerging challenges.” Albanese signalled greater cooperation to “guard against cybersecurity threats”. “Clearly, our national capacity isn’t where it needs to be – and that’s a serious issue for any business or government that holds people’s private information. “Whether it’s cybersecurity or energy or skills or infrastructure or international trade, I know there is so much we can achieve if we work together. “I’m proud of what we’ve delivered over the past six months – and I’m looking forward to what the future holds.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jul/18/aboriginal-owners-and-energy-investors-team-up-in-plan-for-3bn-green-hydrogen-plant-in-wa","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-17T15:00:31Z","webTitle":"Aboriginal owners and energy investors team up in plan for $3bn green hydrogen plant in WA","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/18/aboriginal-owners-and-energy-investors-team-up-in-plan-for-3bn-green-hydrogen-plant-in-wa","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jul/18/aboriginal-owners-and-energy-investors-team-up-in-plan-for-3bn-green-hydrogen-plant-in-wa","fields":{"bodyText":"A unique partnership between three traditional owner groups and a major clean energy investor is promising to establish a $3bn green hydrogen project in the far north of Western Australia. In what could be one of Australia’s biggest clean energy projects, more than a million solar panels will power electrolysers to produce 50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year. The East Kimberley Clean Energy project will be unveiled at the Australian renewable energy industry’s annual summit in Sydney on Tuesday. A new company – Aboriginal Clean Energy – will develop the ambitious project near the town of Kununurra. Three Indigenous groups will each have an initial 25% share in the company alongside climate crisis investment and advisory firm Pollination. The head of projects at Pollination, Rob Grant, said the company structure engages traditional owners as true collaborators, developers and beneficiaries, and represented a “just, ambitious and achievable vision” for clean energy projects in Australia. The feasibility and capital raising for the project is still to be completed, but Grant said the partnership was hoping to start construction in late 2025, with the first hydrogen produced by late 2028. The project will look to use renewable energy from an existing hydroelectric facility near the Ord River to turn all the green hydrogen into 250,000 tonnes of green ammonia each year for agricultural fertilisers to be sold in Australia and for export. The plan includes a new 120km pipeline to store and transport green ammonia to the “export ready” port of Wyndham. Grant said the region provides sunlight, clean water and renewable energy – the main components needed for green hydrogen, which is extracted from water by electrolysis. Ammonia production is currently heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Producing green ammonia from green hydrogen would be a major step to decarbonising the food supply chain. Traditional owner groups MG Corporation, the Kimberley Land Council and Balanggarra Aboriginal Corporation will each own 25% of the company. The conventional model for major projects on Indigenous land in Australia sees developers seeking permission from native title holders with the payment of royalties. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Those agreements usually come at the end of projects and historically they have been distributive, rather than inclusive,” Grant said. Grant said the new project’s ownership structure turned that old approach on its head and represented a “just, ambitious and achievable vision for Australia’s clean energy future”. Aboriginal Clean Energy’s share in the project will probably dilute once agreements are reached with investors and industrial partners. But having a partnership approach with traditional owners would be an attractive prospect for investors, Grant said, as it reduced the risk of future problems with land use agreements and other approvals. This would reduce the risk for investors and shorten the development schedule. The chief executive of Kimberley Land Council, Tyronne Garstone, said for Australia to meet its international cilmate commitments, “a lot of the projects will have to happen on Indigenous land”. He said at the heart of the Aboriginal Clean Energy partnership is that traditional owners will have the opportunity to have equity in the company to ensure there are “flow-on benefits”. Garstone pointed to the “tragedy” of Jukkan Gorge where Rio Tinto blew up a 46,000-year-old cave site as they expanded an iron ore mine. “We can’t just keep going along with the same processes that we have followed through the dirty energy revolution that have delivered a pittance to traditional owners. We need something radically different.” The planned 900MW solar farm – which if built today would be the biggest in Australia – and the hydrogen production facility, will be built on MG Corporation freehold land. The executive chair of MG Corporation, Lawford Benning, said all of the company’s activities must be “sustainable, intergenerational” and aim to “connect culture and land”. “A focus on First Nations economic empowerment has led groups like ours to reject the historic passive engagement model of receiving royalties for agreeing to give up control of our lands.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T17:56:20Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukrainian fighter pilots learning to fly F-16 jets as Kyiv claims progress in counteroffensive – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-live-kryvyi-rih-hit-by-russian-cruise-missiles-say-officials-odesa-targeted-by-strikes-for-second-day","fields":{"bodyText":"Good evening. It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv. Here is a summary of today’s main news stories. Kyiv reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing “There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front].” Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km (38 sq miles) of territory in its counteroffensive, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: “We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands.” Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general revealed. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. A group of UN experts said they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the “verge of being severed”. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries’ “strategic partnership” during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot towards Asia and Africa. A Russian anti-war activist died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow’s war in Ukraine. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group remained “laser-focused” on meeting Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence system needs. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog said a number of measures had been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe’s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia, but that signing a document on security on the site was “unrealistic” while the two sides were still fighting. The US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark announced they will partner to send defence equipment – including hundreds of missiles – to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed “within several weeks”. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. MEPs called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combating the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: “I know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital. We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine.” Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. The Kryvyi Rih mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, reported no deaths in the latest attack on Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town, but said a 38-year-old man was reportedly wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. Russian forces claimed they successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons. The head of Russia’s electoral commission said the defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections on 10 September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, the state news agency Tass reported. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. Follow our live coverage again tomorrow for the latest in Ukraine. Thank you for reading. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Thursday that he hoped for a positive outcome from Vladimir Putin’s planned talks with African leaders on the future of a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine. Ukrainian fighter pilots are being trained to fly F-16 jets, Nato’s secretary general has revealed, as Kyiv claimed further incremental progress in its counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east and south of Ukraine. Nato allies have yet to agree on delivering the so-called fourth-generation US fighters to Ukraine, but Jens Stoltenberg said the training of Ukrainian personnel was under way. As he arrived at a meeting of defence ministers in Brussels, the former prime minister of Norway said: The fact that training has started provides us with the option to also decide to deliver the planes and then the pilots will be ready to fly them. As recently as February, Joe Biden declined Ukrainian requests for the lightweight fighter aircraft. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is understood to have subsequently given firm commitments that the planes would be used only to target Russian forces within Ukraine. It will still take months to train Ukraine’s pilots, who will have previously flown mainly in Soviet-standard aircraft. Ukraine does not yet even have runways suitable for F-16s, should Nato allies agree to provide the hardware. Beyond the provision of fighter jet training, it has been announced in Brussels that the US, UK, the Netherlands and Denmark are sending “high-priority” air defence equipment including hundreds of missiles to Ukraine and that the delivery will be completed within weeks. A group of UN experts said on Thursday they had written to Moscow raising concerns about the use of torture by Russian military forces on Ukrainian civilians and prisoners of war. The UN experts said the torture included electric shocks, hoodings and mock executions and had been carried out to extract intelligence, force confessions or in response to alleged support for Ukraine’s forces, Reuters reports. The UN special rapporteur on torture, Alice Jill Edwards, said the alleged victims included civilians and prisoners of war. She said she had written to Moscow about this. A spokesperson for Russia’s diplomatic mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has previously denied torturing or mistreating prisoners of war and says it does not deliberately target civilians in Ukraine. While torture allegations have previously been levelled against both sides in the 15-month conflict, the team of UN independent experts said Russian forces’ methods may be “state-endorsed”. The consistency and methods of alleged torture suggested “a level of coordination, planning and organisation, as well as the direct authorisation, deliberate policy or official tolerance from superior authorities,” according to Edwards. She said: Obeying a superior order or policy direction cannot be invoked as justification for torture, and any individual involved should be promptly investigated and prosecuted by independent authorities. Russia’s economy shrank by a revised 1.8% year on year in the first quarter of 2023, data from the Rosstat federal statistics service showed on Thursday, after growth of 3% in the same period of last year. Russia’s economy defied early expectations of a double-digit collapse in 2022 but still contracted 2.1% after the west imposed sanctions in response to Moscow dispatching troops to Ukraine in February. Rosstat had previously forecast a 1.9% decline in the first quarter, Reuters reports. African leaders could propose a series of “confidence-building measures” during their initial efforts to mediate in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, according to a draft framework document seen by Reuters on Thursday. Those measures could include a Russian troop pullback, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, suspension of an international criminal court arrest warrant targeting Vladimir Putin, and sanctions relief. A cessation of hostilities agreement could follow and would need to be accompanied by negotiations between Russia and the west, the document states. Republican and Democratic members of the US Congress introduced legislation on Thursday that would make it easier for Ukraine to fund its fight against Russian invaders by using seized and frozen Russian assets. The US Congress has approved more than $100bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid for Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. While leaders of both parties insist US support for the Kyiv government remains strong, some members of Congress have questioned how long that level of aid can continue amid calls to clamp down on government spending. The bill’s sponsors said their intention was to ensure Moscow pays for damage caused by the invasion, not US taxpayers. Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee and a sponsor of the bill, said: Over a year into Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, more than $300bn in Russian sovereign assets remain frozen globally. Given Russia’s brutality and continued war crimes against the Ukrainian people, it is only right that Russian government funds in the United States be seized and repurposed to help Ukraine rebuild its country. Among other things, the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity (Repo) for Ukrainians Act introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives would give the US president the authority to confiscate Russian assets frozen in the US and transfer them to help Ukraine. It also would bar the release of funds to sanctioned Russian entities until Russia withdraws from Ukraine and agrees to provide compensation for harm caused by the war. The bill’s other Republican sponsors include representatives Michael McCaul, chair of the House foreign affairs committee, and Joe Wilson, Thomas Kean and Brian Fitzpatrick. Democratic sponsors include Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and representative Marcy Kaptur, a co-chair of the congressional Ukraine caucus, as well as representatives Steve Cohen and Mike Quigley. Vladimir Putin and the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, pledged to deepen their two countries’ “strategic partnership” during a three-day state visit by Tebboune as the Kremlin seeks to pivot Russia towards Asia and Africa. The two leaders signed a declaration on “deep strategic partnership”, among other agreements. Putin said: We are really happy to receive our friend, the president of Algeria, Mr Tebboune, in the Kremlin. Algeria is a key partner for us in the Arab world and in Africa. We will be glad to see you in St Petersburg. Relations with Algeria are of particular importance for our country. Tebboune said western pressure on Algeria would not have any impact, and both men stressed the Soviet Union’s robust support for Algeria during and after its fight for independence from France. Tebboune said: Foreign countries may put pressure on us today but this will never affect our ties. Our ties never changed. Algeria has always supported Russia. Tebboune saidRussia had been providing his country with weapons to help it “maintain our independence in these difficult circumstances”. The Russian foreign ministry tweeted that Vladimir Putin held talks with the president of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, during a state visit to Russia. Putin reportedly said there was “tangible potential for further development” between the two nations. Russia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday that it had summoned a Canadian diplomat in Moscow in protest over the confiscation of an Antonov plane in Toronto, and warned that Russian-Canadian relations were on the “verge of being severed”. Canada on Saturday ordered the seizure of a Russian-registered Antonov-124 cargo plane at Toronto’s airport, its first such asset seizure aimed at putting pressure on Moscow over the Ukraine invasion, Reuters reports. Russia told Brian Ebel, the deputy head of Canada’s embassy in Moscow, that it viewed the plane seizure as “cynical theft”, according to a statement from the foreign ministry. In a statement, the Russian ministry said: [Canada’s’] Russophobic policy will entail the most serious repercussions for Russian-Canadian relations, which are on the verge of being severed through the fault of the Trudeau administration. The Canadian foreign ministry did not have an immediate comment. Canada announced the aircraft seizure while the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was in Kyiv on Saturday, where he announced $500m (£392m) in military aid for Ukraine. A Russian anti-war activist has died in a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don where he had alleged he was being mistreated, his lawyer said today. Anatoly Berezikov’s lawyer Irina Gak said in a video posted on Facebook that the body of her client, who had been due to be released on Thursday, had been taken to a morgue on Wednesday. A video filmed on Wednesday showed Gak standing outside the detention centre where 40-year-old Berezikov had been held as an ambulance that she said was there to collect his body drove in, Reuters reports. These claims have not been independently verified. In the video, Gak said Berezikov had complained of beatings and of being given electric shocks and had told her he feared for his life. According to Gak, Berezikov was arrested after he posted leaflets around the city advertising a Ukrainian government project called I Want to Live, which helps Russian soldiers voluntarily surrender. Rostov-on-Don is the capital of a region adjoining Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine. According to OVD-Info, a human rights monitoring group, nearly 20,000 people have been detained for protesting against Russia’s war in Ukraine since the start of the invasion. They claim criminal cases have been launched against more than 580 people. The Polish deputy prime minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, reaffirmed his support for Ukraine, saying he had “no doubts” that Vladimir Putin’s true intentions were to “go further” after conquering Ukraine. The president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, said on Thursday that Russians living abroad in western countries should be closely monitored by security services, given Moscow’s “aggressive war” in Ukraine. The Czech leader and former chair of the Nato military committee said he was sympathetic to Russians outside the country finding it hard to cope with the invasion but in the context of a war, security measures should be more stringent. He told the Prague-based, US-financed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: When there is an ongoing war, the security measures related to Russian nationals should be stricter than in normal times. All Russians living in western countries should be monitored much more than in the past because they are citizens of a nation that leads an aggressive war,” Pavel said. That’s simply the cost of war. He said the situation was similar to the second world war when more than 100,000 Japanese descendants based in the US were under “a strict monitoring regime as well” as they were placed in local internment camps. Pavel also said he expected the July Nato summit in Vilnius to voice clear support for Kyiv’s membership of the alliance. He said: I strongly believe that all the leaders will understand that having Ukraine onboard – both in Nato and EU – is probably the only guarantee [of] how to ensure stability in this region, how to make both Nato and EU stronger, and how to keep Russia and its aggressive policies at bay. I see a number of countries agreeing on a long-term plan of support to Ukraine that will not be based on one-off contributions but on a carefully planned long-term procedure. In Brussels, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, says the Ukraine Defence Contact Group meeting has concluded and it remains “laser-focused” on meeting Ukraine’s ground-based air-defence system needs. He added: That’s especially important since Russia has ruthlessly ramped up its missile and drone attacks over the past month against Ukraine’s cities. Zelenskiy’s former spokesperson has shared this video of Kyiv graduates waltzing in the subway during an air raid alert: The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has said a “number of measures” have been taken to stabilise the situation at Europe’s largest atomic power plant. Rafael Grossi said inspectors would stay at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, occupied by Russia (see also this earlier post), but that signing a document on security on the site was “unrealistic” while the two sides were still fighting. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief visited the plant, in southern Ukraine, today after meeting Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss concerns about the site. Russia’s deputy finance minister, Alexei Sazanov, has said the country is approaching the tax ceiling for commodity industries. He cited what he called weak global demand for its products, reports Interfax news agency. The US, UK, Netherlands and Denmark have announced they will partner to send defence equipment – including hundreds of missiles – to Ukraine. A joint statement released by the British government said delivery of the equipment had already begun and should be completed “within several weeks”. As many as 100 Russian troops gathered for a motivational speech near Ukraine’s eastern frontline may have been killed in a strike earlier this week, prompting fury among Russian military bloggers. While the details remain unclear and unconfirmed, a number of Russian Telegram channels have been discussing the attack, which they say took place near Kreminna, an eastern town in the Luhansk region where there has been heavy fighting. The alleged incident took place as soldiers were gathered and made to wait for two hours for a speech from a divisional commander, identified by some as Sukhrab Akhmedov, of the 20th Guards Combined Arms Army, an already controversial figure who had been blamed for the deaths of large numbers of his troops in a botched offensive last year. According to the Russian military blogger Rybar, the soldiers who were due to be deployed on an offensive had been told to muster for a speech. The tragic incident occurred near Kreminna, in one of the divisions that was about to go on the offensive. For two hours, people stood in a crowd in one place and waited for the division commander to deliver a motivational speech. But instead, Himars and enemy artillery spoke. Rybar added there “were fewer casualties in several days of fighting in the south Donetsk direction than from the criminal stupidity of the division commander”. Other military bloggers quickly weighed in. “If by the middle of the second year of the war there are commanders who take the columns to the front, make the personnel form a big heap and then wait for the enemy’s artillery to hit them, then such commanders should be shot in front of the columns, even if they are colonels or generals,” said one. “We are at war with our own stupidity and negligence,” said another. The strike was given additional credence by the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War, which included it in its daily updated on the conflict: ISW has observed both of the 20th CAA’s divisions, the 144th and 3rd Motorized Rifle Ddivisions, operating in the Kreminna area for the past several months and could not confirm which division was struck by the Ukrainian forces. One milblogger[military blogger] suggested that the reported Ukrainian HIMARSimars strike killed around 100 Russian personnel and wounded another 100, although ISW has not observed any visual confirmation of the strike or its aftermath.[9] The outrage is reminiscent of previous instances of notable irresponsible Russian military actions resulting in dramatic losses, particularly the 31 December 2022, Ukrainian strike on a large Russian force concentration in Makiivka, Donetsk oblast. MEPs have called on Nato allies to honour their commitment to Ukraine by inviting the country to join the defence alliance and support opening EU accession negotiations this year, a press release from the European parliament says. There were 425 votes in favour of the resolution and 38 against, with 42 abstentions. The release says: MEPs stress that they expect that the “accession process will start after the war is over and be finalised as soon as possible”. Until full membership is achieved, the EU and its member states, together with Nato allies and like-minded partners, must work closely with Ukraine to develop a temporary framework for security guarantees, MEPs say, which is to be implemented immediately after the war. Parliament emphasises that Ukraine’s integration in both Nato and the EU would enhance regional and global security and strengthen the bonds between Ukraine and the Euro-Atlantic community. MEPs condemned “in the strongest possible terms Russia’s destruction of the Kakhovka dam” on 6 June, which they said had caused extensive flooding and created an environmental disaster as well as ecocide in Ukraine. All those responsible for war crimes, including the destruction of the dam, would be held accountable in line with international law, they added. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Switzerland to allow the re-export of weapons to Ukraine, saying the move would be vital in combatting the Russian invasion. In a video message shown in the Swiss parliament, he said: I know there is a discussion in Switzerland about the exportation of war material to protect and defend Ukraine. That would be vital We need weapons so we can restore peace in Ukraine. Switzerland has a longstanding policy of barring any country that buys Swiss arms from re-exporting them to the parties in a conflict. The country also imposed a specific Swiss embargo on munitions going to either Russia or Ukraine in November last year, Reuters reports. Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the Swiss parliament via video message, where he asked Switzerland to take a leading role in the global peace summit on Ukraine, Reuters reports. Here are some images from the wires. More information to come … Russian missiles hit two industrial facilities in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Thursday, and an elderly woman was killed by Russian fire in the southern Kherson region, local officials said. Kryvyi Rih mayor Oleksandr Vilkul reported no deaths in the latest attack on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home town, but said a 38-year-old man had been wounded when three missiles struck two industrial enterprises overnight. On Telegram, Vilkul wrote: The destruction is significant. The attack on Kryvyi Rih followed missile strikes that killed at least 12 people in the city on Tuesday. Russia denies targeting civilians, but Ukrainian officials said none of the buildings hit had any links to the armed forces, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s military also reported a new Russian attack on the southern port city of Odesa overnight but said all 18 drones launched by Russia had been shot down. An 80-year-old woman was killed and another person wounded in an attack on the Zelenivka settlement in Kherson in southern Ukraine, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Russia’s Tass news agency quoted Moscow-installed officials in Russian-occupied territory in the Kherson region, which was hit by flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, as saying a child had been killed by Ukrainian shelling. Both sides have reported heavy fighting in the early stages of a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Ukraine has regained control of more than 100 sq km, or 38 sq miles, of territory in its counteroffensive against Russian forces, a senior Ukrainian military commander claimed on Thursday. Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov told a media briefing: We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands. He confirmed that in the early stages of the offensive, which Ukraine said had begun last week, seven settlements had been liberated in the eastern region of Donetsk and in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, Reuters reports. The army has advanced by to 3km (1.8 miles) near the village of Mala Tokmachka in the Zaporizhzhia sector and by up to 7km near a village south of Velyka Novosilka in the Donetsk sector, military officials said. Russia has not officially acknowledged the Ukrainian advances. These claims have not been independently verified. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog visited Europe’s largest atomic power plant on Thursday in southern Ukraine, where the Kakhovka dam burst earlier this month. The visit was announced by Ukraine’s national nuclear energy company, Energoatom, in a Telegram post. Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)chief, met Tuesday in Kyiv with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss concerns about the Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm over the facility, which has repeatedly been caught in the crossfire since Russia launched its war on Ukraine in February 2022 and seized the facility shortly after. Last week, the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine’s partially Russian-occupied Kherson region added a new concern. The dam, further down the Dnipro River, helped keep water in a reservoir that cools the plant’s reactors. The plant’s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Russia’s central election commission on Thursday set the date for regional elections in four Ukrainian provinces that Moscow claims to have annexed for 10 September coinciding with votes in other Russian regions, state news agency RIA reported. Tass, another state news agency, cited election chief Ella Pamfilova as saying that Russia’s Defence Ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) considered it possible to hold the votes in September. Ruslan Stefanchuk, chair of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, has said the European parliament expects that the summits in Vilnius and Washington in the coming months will mark the start of Ukraine’s accession to Nato after strong support for the country’s integration into the Euro-Atlantic community. Nato sees no sign that Russia has changed its nuclear stance, the head of the military alliance said Thursday, after the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed that Belarus had already received some tactical nuclear weapons from Moscow. In an interview on state television on Tuesday, Lukashenko brashly warned that he would not hesitate to order their use if Belarus faced an act of aggression. The Russian president Vladimir Putin has said the weapons will be deployed to Belarus next month and will remain under Moscow’s exclusive control. At the Nato headquarters in Brussels, Belgium the secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters: We are, of course, closely monitoring what Russia is doing. So far, we haven’t seen any changes in the nuclear posture that requires any changes in our posture. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and messaging is reckless and dangerous. Russia must know that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Russia has invested heavily in new modern nuclear capabilities and also deployed more nuclear capabilities, including close to Nato borders, for instance, in the high north.” Nato’s secretive nuclear defence planning group is due to meet on Friday. Russian forces successfully hit drone production facilities in Ukraine using high-precision, long-range weapons, Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday, according to the state-run RIA news agency. The ministry also said Russian air defences had intercepted five US-built Himars-launched missiles and shot down 25 drones, the Tass news agency also reported. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come … Kyiv on Thursday reported progress in its newly launched counteroffensive, despite strong resistance from Russian troops. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told a briefing: There is a gradual but steady advance of the armed forces. At the same time, the enemy is putting up powerful resistance [on the southern front]. Around the frontline hotspot of Bakhmut, “the enemy is pulling up additional reserves and is trying with all its might to prevent the advance of Ukrainian forces”, according to AFP Still, Maliar reported an advance of more than 3km (1.8 miles) in the area of Bakhmut. Oleksiy Gromov of the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said Ukrainian forces have recaptured seven settlements and more than 100 sq km of territory. Russia claims to have repelled all Ukrainian assaults. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the soldiers who have lost their lives have not died in vain because Ukraine will defeat Russia. He said Ukrainians would honour their memory by winning and “living in freedom”. The head of Russia’s electoral commission has said that the country’s defence ministry and Federal Security Service (FSB) consider it possible to hold elections in September in the four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed, state news agency Tass reported on Thursday. Russia does not fully control the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fighting is ongoing in all four regions. The regions are scheduled to elect local governors in September, Reuters reports. Russia declared the regions part of its own territory after hastily conducting what it called referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine last September that Kyiv and the west denounced as illegal and coercive. Russia has said it plans to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream pipeline gas explosions. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a “marathon, not a sprint” and that America will “stand with Ukraine for the long haul”. He made the comments at a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. Also speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said defence ministers meet today at a “critical time” for the war in Ukraine in a “more dangerous world”. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused “significant” damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” Handing over to Mabel Banfield-Nwachi now. Thanks for reading. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has arrived at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Reuters reports. Grossi is expected to inspect the plant after last week’s breach of the Kakhovka dam. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson has said that Russia intends to go back to the UN security council over the investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions. Meanwhile, the Kremlin accused Australia of being “hostile” and of “Russophobic hysteria” after it refused to grant approval for its plans to build a new embassy in Canberra, reports Reuters. It also said it saw no positive prospects of renewing the Black Sea grain deal, claiming that parts of the accord affecting Russia remained unfulfilled. A Kremlin spokesperson said: Work is ongoing, but to be honest we don’t see any particularly positive prospects. Everything that was agreed on regarding us has not been fulfilled. The current situation, he said, could not go on indefinitely. Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a resident of the southern Bryansk region who it said had been gathering data on security forces in areas bordering Ukraine, Russian state news agency Tass reports. Separately, it said, the FSB had detained two men in the southern Stavropol region on suspicion of planning to blow up the interior ministry headquarters in the city of Pyatigorsk. The RIA news agency said the two men were believed to be supporters of the Islamic State group, reports Reuters. The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, has reportedly been pictured on a visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukrainian pilots have started training to fly F-16 fighters, the Nato secretary general has said. Jens Stoltenberg was speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked Norway and Denmark for their new joint defence package announced earlier (see also this post). He tweeted: A child was killed by Ukrainian shelling in the partly Russian-held southern Kherson region, Reuters reports, citing the Tass news agency. Kherson is one of four regions Russia claims to have annexed from Ukraine last year, though its forces do not fully control the territory. Vladimir Putin has praised his “dear friend” Xi Jinping on the Chinese leader’s 70th birthday. The Russian president told Xi “it is difficult to overestimate the efforts you have been making to foster the comprehensive partnership” between his country and China, which have ramped up cooperation in recent years, reports AFP. He expects “constructive dialogue ... to continue for the sake of the Russian and Chinese people”, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the war in Ukraine is a “marathon, not a sprint” and that America will “stand with Ukraine for the long haul”. In public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels he paid tribute to the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, who he was earlier pictured embracing, and said Ukraine “stands well positioned for the challenges ahead.” “Make no mistake, we will stand with Ukraine for the long haul,” he said, adding that US commitment is reflected in its security and defence support. The contact group, he said, has been focused on protecting Ukrainian infrastructure with air defence assets and will continue to adapt systems to meet changing needs on the ground. In today’s meeting they will talk about future training plans, he said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has said the attack on Kryvyi Rih is “one more reminder of the war’s devastating consequences to civilians”. The Russian missile attack “killed nearly a dozen people and injured many more”, he said, adding that recently people have had to ration water due to the attack on the Nova Kakhovka dam in Kherson. The war was at a “critical and historic moment”, he told the Ukraine defence contact group at Nato HQ in Brussels. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, is about to make his opening remarks in Brussels. Ukraine said it intercepted one cruise missile and 20 drones overnight. But it said three other missiles struck “industrial installations” in the Dnipropetrovsk region in Ukraine’s centre-east, reports AFP. Meanwhile, the Moscow-installed governor of Crimea said Russian forces had downed nine drones over its territory, without causing any casualties. It comes after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed on Tuesday that his forces were inflicting “catastrophic” losses on Ukrainian troops. Nato members are racing to complete a plan to provide long-term support to Ukraine, but are wrestling with now best to assure its security until it can join the military alliance, reports Reuters citing US and European officials. The plan is expected to be approved next month at the Nato summit in Vilnius. Tweeting from Nato HQ in Brussels, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, pledges continued support to Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. He is due to deliver public opening remarks at the meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group later this morning. Oleksandra Matviichuk, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Civil Liberties, has shared a picture of a “cabinet with children’s books” from flooded Kherson, which she said had floated to the Odesa shore: Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is “reckless and dangerous”, the Nato secretary general has said. Speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s behaviour is “part of a pattern” which Nato has responded to. “If we want a just and enduring peace” then Nato has to continue with its military support for Ukraine, he added. He said he expects Nato leaders to extend their defence spending pledges, but that he doesn’t expect it to be agreed until the Nato summit in Vilnius next month. Speaking in Brussels, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said defence ministers meet today at a “critical time” in a “more dangerous world”. He said: Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive, what we see is fierce fighting. It’s still early days but we also see that Ukrainians are making gains and that Ukraine is able to liberate occupied land. He highlights support Nato allies have been giving to Ukraine “for many many months actually makes a difference on the battlefield”. They will be looking at how to sustain support in meeting today. “The war in Ukraine just demonstrates the need to stand with Ukraine” and for continued support, he said. They also plan to strengthen defence spending. Today they will meet defence industry members and agree at the meeting “new capability targets” to ensure sufficient ammunition which he said will be “significantly higher” than previously. “Ukraine needs many different types of support” but focus will be on sustainment, he said during questions. Nato defence ministers are meeting in Brussels today. A doorstep statement by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is due to come shortly. Norway and Denmark have agreed to donate an additional 9,000 rounds of artillery to Ukraine. Norway will send shells and Denmark fuses and propellant charges, the Norwegian government announced. The Norwegian defence minister, Bjørn Arild Gram, said: Ukraine has an urgent need for artillery ammunition. We have therefore decided to join forces with Denmark for a new donation, so that Ukraine receives the ammunition as quickly as possible. It is important that we continue to stand together in demonstrating our support of Ukraine. Norway will continue to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion forces as long as it is needed. The acting Danish defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said Denmark would additionally donate 1,500 complete artillery rounds and 500 shells. The breach of the Kakhovka dam will not affect Russia’s crop forecasts, the Russian deputy prime minister, Viktoria Abramchenko, has said, according to the state-owned news agency Tass. Hi, I’ll be looking after the blog for the next few hours. Please get in touch with any tips or suggestions: miranda.bryant@theguardian.com The Australian government has rushed through special legislation allowing it to cancel Russia’s lease on a site for a new embassy near the country’s parliament, citing national security concerns. Prime minister Anthony Albanese promised to act “quickly to ensure the leased site does not become a formal diplomatic presence”. The Russian government took legal action after a decision in August to terminate its lease on a block of land in the capital, Canberra. On 31 May the Russian government won its case in Australia’s federal court, which found the termination was “invalid and of no effect”. Albanese told reporters in Canberra the government had “received very clear security advice as to the risk presented by a new Russian presence so close to parliament House”. Australia’s home affairs minister said “the principal problem with the proposed second Russian embassy in Canberra is its location. This location sits directly adjacent to Parliament House.” The governor of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region has shared images that are reportedly from the site of the strikes on Kryvyi Rih. Serhiy Lysak said that two industrial complexes were hit in overnight strikes on the city, injuring one person. While the damage was reported to be ‘“significant”, the city’s mayor said the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Japan is in talks to provide artillery shells to the US to bolster stocks for Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russia. To date, Japan has only provided non-lethal aid to Ukraine. The report claims that Tokyo is considering supplying 155mm artillery shells “under a 2016 agreement that allows the Japan and the US to share ammunition as part of their longstanding security alliance.” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin held talks earlier this month in Tokyo with Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada. After the meeting, Austin praised Japan for the nonlethal military support it has given Ukraine and said additional assistance would be welcome. In March, the EU’s most senior diplomat warned that there would be “difficulties” if western countries failed to reach a deal to replenish Ukraine’s dwindling stocks of ammunition. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. The commander, Adam Delimkhanov, heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Delimkhanov was “alive and well and not even wounded”. Earlier on Wednesday, Russian media, citing the parliamentary press service, said that Delimkhanov had been wounded in Ukraine. It followed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Oleksandr Vilkul, the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, has said that missile strikes on an industrial complex in the city caused “significant” damage, but the two enterprises that had been hit “had nothing to do with the military.” Three missiles hit two industrial enterprises overnight, Vilkul said, adding that a fourth was shot down by air defences. Thank you to the employees of the enterprises who, after the announcement of the air raid alert, went to the shelter, because of which they remained unharmed … All important infrastructure, public transport, social and medical institutions [in] the city work stably.” Vilkul said that at noon local time, a planned explosion would be carried out for “production purposes”. Odesa was reportedly targeted by Russian strikes overnight, after already enduring a deadly wave in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s southern military command released a statement in the early hours of Thursday morning, saying Russia was attacking “with unmanned aerial vehicles” – meaning drones – and there was “also a threat of a missile attack”, while advising residents to go to shelters. Officials later said that all 20 drones that attacked in the south were destroyed by air defence forces. On Wednesday, three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Authorities said that air defences downed two of the Russian Kalibr cruise missiles launched on Wednesday morning, but the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. Ukrainian military officials said that Wednesday’s attack on Odesa was “apparently aimed at the objects sought by the enemy in the area of logistics support for the defence forces.” Russian cruise missiles hit two industrial complexes in the central city of Kryvyi Rih overnight, according to Serhiy Lysak, the region’s governor. Lysak said the strikes caused significant damage, including broken gas pipelines. Fires broke out at enterprises, which rescuers have already put out.” A 38-year-old man was injured in the attack and has been hospitalised. Military officials said that four cruise missiles were launched by Russia overnight. One of the missiles was destroyed by air defences, the rest hit industrial facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk region, where Kryvyi Rih is located. It’s the second time that Kryvyi Rih – Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s home city – has been targeted by Russian airstrikes this week. On Tuesday morning, at least 12 people were killed and many more were wounded after a missile struck an apartment block and a food warehouse in the city. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, my name is Jonathan Yerushalmy. The central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been hit by Russian airstrikes for the second time this week. Cruise missiles struck two industrial enterprises, the region’s governor said. A 38-year-old man was injured in the attacks. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s port city of Odesa was targeted by Russian airstrikes for the second day in a row. Users on Ukrainian social media reported hearing explosions and Ukraine’s southern military command said that Russia was attacking “with unmanned aerial vehicles” and there was also “a threat of a missile attack.” More on that shortly, first here’s are the other key developments from the last 24 hours: Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. “This is incredibly difficult,” the official said. “They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.” Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. “It is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,” he said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia’s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world’s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-13T00:59:23Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 444 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of Bakhmut. The defence ministry’s statement on Friday was Moscow’s first admission that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around the largely destroyed eastern Ukrainian city Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done most of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” that had seen troops flee. He said via his press service that Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Kyiv damaged two disused factories and five homes in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, around 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. Luhansk authorities said on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian-made “grom” tactical missiles damaged or destroyed administrative buildings at a packaging plant and a factory producing cleaning materials. No casualties were reported. Two Russian pilots were killed when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. It said it believed the reason for Friday’s crash was equipment failure, Tass reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president Petr Pavel has said. The former Nato general said in an interview on Friday that Ukraine needed support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either would be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. South Africa’s foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Reuben Brigety said on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a Russian vessel, which is under sanctions, at a naval base near Cape Town in December last year and that the arms were then transported to Russia. Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine, in a phone call with his South African counterpart, according to the Kremlin. The Russian president said on Friday he supported South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, the Kremlin’s readout of the call said. Russia’s defence ministry has said Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in Thursday’s assault, it said on Friday, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the European Union will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who was meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has expressed disappointment at a decision to block Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to speak via video at Saturday’s Eurovision grand final. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the event, said the Ukrainian president had “laudable” intentions but rejected the request over fears it could politicise the event. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, underscored their support for Ukraine during a White House meeting that also touched on migration and defence cooperation. During talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden said that “together we’re supporting Ukraine” and Sanchez squarely blamed the war on Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/visual-guide-collapse-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T08:33:08Z","webTitle":"A visual guide to the collapse of Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/visual-guide-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/visual-guide-collapse-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam","fields":{"bodyText":"Where is the dam and what has happened? The dam is located upstream of the city of Kherson on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine. Russia controls the territory on the left bank of the river. The right bank is held by Ukraine. In the early hours of 6 June, the dam collapsed. Before its collapse, the 30-metre-high, 2km-long dam had a road running along its top. It powered the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, a major energy producer, and held back a reservoir containing 18 cubic km of water that supplied communities and agriculture and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control. How serious is the damage and the flooding? Before-and-after satellite images show the extent of the damage to the dam and the adjacent Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which were largely swept away. The collapse sent water cascading downstream, flooding 230 sq miles of territory, according to Ukrainian authorities. This map shows the extent of the flooding as of 7 June. The geography around the river means Russian-controlled areas to the south have been more badly hit. North of Kherson city, the land rises to a plain overlooking the river. To the south is a wide delta with marshes, low-lying islands and flat, sandy levels. Video images from the city of Russian-controlled Nova Kakhovka showed flood waters in the main square rising around the municipal building on 6 June. This footage shows flooding in Korsunka, Dnipriany and Nova Kakhovka – the three settlements immediately downstream of the dam on the Russian-controlled left bank of the river. These before-and-after satellite images show the impact of the flooding on the settlements of Krynky and Oleshky. These images show the flooding of a granary in Nova Kakhovka. What has the humanitarian impact been? At least five people have reportedly died as a result of the floods, a number that is expected to increase. Emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Kherson said on 8 June that up to 14,000 homes had been flooded. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes. Some of those who haven’t left have become stranded on rooftops as the water levels have risen. This drone footage shows water being delivered by air to a family trapped in their house in Oleshky. They were later rescued. Who was responsible? Ukraine has blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year’s full-scale invasion, of blowing it up in an attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Kremlin says Kyiv sabotaged the dam to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. Ukraine’s allies in the west have not directly apportioned blame to Russia, but they have questioned why Kyiv would want to destroy the dam. Engineering experts have said the collapse was most likely caused by a deliberate explosion inside the dam. It is possible that the collapse was made more impactful by the fact that Russia had deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it. How will it affect Ukraine’s counteroffensive? The delta area had been seen as vulnerable for Russian forces in part because of its low elevation. The flooding has put paid – for now at least – to any potential Ukrainian attempt to cross the Dnipro River around Kherson/Nova Kakhovka by widening the barrier separating the two forces. The loss of the road across the top of the dam also deprives Ukraine of a potential line of attack across the river, leaving only the Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson city as a paved river crossing. The flooding may also allow Russian reserves in the south to block any move on Melitopol. And it could free up troop reserves concentrated in the south, allowing them to be directed elsewhere. What is the impact on farming and the environment? In the hours after the collapse, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said “a global ecological disaster” was playing out. On 8 June Zelenskiy himself said that 50,000 hectares of forest had been flooded, and that 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were “under threat of imminent death”. This footage from upstream shows dead and dying fish on the drained bottom of the Nova Kakhovka reservoir on 7 June. There are fears that the depleted reservoir will leave three critical regions in Ukraine’s “bread basket” without a key water supply. A series of canals run from the reservoir, all of which help irrigate swaths of agricultural land. The most significant of these canals are the North Crimean canal, which supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea, and the Kakhovsky canal, which irrigates most of the Kherson region’s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia. Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir taken before the dam collapse shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. Ukraine has warned that agricultural land in these regions could be so heavily affected that they could turn into “deserts”. What is the impact on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? The cooling systems for Europe’s largest nuclear plant are supplied with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. If the dam falls below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there are alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘The Godfather, Saudi-style’: inside the palace coup that brought MBS to power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/29/mbs-v-mbn-the-bitter-power-struggle-between-rival-saudi-princes","fields":{"bodyText":"The Saudi prince was detained all night. As daylight broke, he staggered out of the king’s palace in Mecca. His personal bodyguards, who tailed him everywhere, were missing. The prince was led to a waiting car. He was free to leave – but he would soon discover that freedom was not very different from detention. As his car pulled out of the palace gates, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef fired off a series of panicked text messages. “Be very careful! Don’t come back!” he wrote to his most trusted adviser, who had quietly slipped out of the kingdom just weeks earlier. When Nayef reached his own palace in the coastal city of Jeddah a few hours later, he found new guards manning the property. It was obvious that he was being put under house arrest. “May God help us, doctor. The important thing is that you must be careful, and under no circumstances should you come back,” he wrote to the adviser. The previous night, 20 June 2017, Nayef, the king’s nephew, had been forced to step down as heir to the Saudi throne in an episode that one royal insider described to me as “Godfather, Saudi-style”. Nayef, who oversaw domestic security, was the CIA’s closest Saudi ally. Earlier that year, the then-CIA director Mike Pompeo had awarded him a medal in recognition of his counter-terrorism efforts that saved American lives. Two years before, after King Salman commenced his reign, Nayef had been made crown prince at the age of 55, putting him next in line to the throne. But simmering behind the scenes was a vicious rivalry between Nayef and his upstart cousin, the king’s son, Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, who rose from obscurity to become deputy crown prince. Shortly before the palace coup, on 5 June 2017, tensions between the princes reached boiling point after MBS and other regional autocrats imposed a punishing blockade on neighbouring Qatar. The tiny, gas-rich emirate has long rankled its bigger Arab neighbours with its provocative moves, such as giving airtime to regional Islamists and dissidents on its influential news channel Al Jazeera. Nayef, too, had issues with Qatar, but he preferred quiet diplomacy over MBS’s combative approach. Behind his cousin’s back, Nayef opened a secret channel with Qatar’s ruler Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. “Tamim called me today, but I did not answer,” Nayef texted his adviser at the peak of the crisis. “I want to send him an encrypted phone for communication.” On 20 June 2017, in the midst of that crisis, Nayef was called for a meeting in King Salman’s palace in Mecca – a marble-walled colossus overlooking the cube-shaped Ka’bah, the holiest shrine in Islam. According to sources close to Nayef, when he arrived, his security detail was instructed to wait outside. To prevent any leaks, all mobile phones, including those of the palace staff, were seized by guards loyal to MBS. One senior member of the royal family, who tried to enter the palace after Nayef, was turned away at the gates. The prince was allegedly ushered into a room with Turki al-Sheikh, a close MBS confidante with a gruff, intimidating manner and a predilection for expensive Richard Mille watches. (Sheikh would later be promoted to head the General Entertainment Authority – an agency that seeks to soften Saudi Arabia’s image by, among other things, hosting giant raves in the desert.) Sheikh allegedly confined Nayef to the room for hours, pressuring him to sign a resignation letter and pledge allegiance to MBS. At first, Nayef refused. According to one source close to the prince, he was told that if he did not give up his claim to the throne, his female family members would be raped. Nayef’s medication for hypertension and diabetes was withheld, and he was told that if he did not step down willingly, his next destination would be the hospital. He was so afraid of being poisoned that night, said another royal family source, that he refused to drink even water. Nayef was permitted to speak with two princes in the Allegiance Council, the royal body that ratifies the line of succession. He was shocked to hear that they had already submitted to MBS. By daybreak, it was all over. Anxious and exhausted, Nayef surrendered. He was made to step into an adjoining room, where MBS was waiting with television cameras and a guard carrying a gun. Footage released by Saudi broadcasters showed a brief glimpse of Sheikh hurriedly slipping a gold-trimmed robe on the back of the detained prince. As the cameras rolled, MBS crept closer to his cousin and theatrically stooped down to kiss his hand and knee. “When I pledged allegiance, there was a gun to my back,” Nayef later wrote in a text to his adviser. In the days that followed, posters of Nayef were removed from public buildings. MBS was now first in line to the throne, and effectively the most powerful man in the country at the age of 31. The octogenarian king remained head of state, but MBS became the day-to-day ruler, with absolute control over all levers of Saudi security, economy and oil. Nayef, the darling of US intelligence, who had assumed he would be the next ruler of Saudi Arabia, was now a prisoner. But for him, worse was to come. * * * The palace coup, and the power plays that led to it, were largely obscured from public view at the time, with only scraps of information – and dollops of propaganda – leaking out to the press. International media, for example, was fed what Nayef’s associates call spurious claims that he had been pushed aside in the national interest because he was incapacitated by morphine and cocaine addiction. Getting at the truth is especially hard in a country where the surveillance state is so powerful that some Saudis place their phones in the refrigerator while discussing sensitive matters. The Saudi embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment for this article. But a detailed account of the events of 2017, and its shocking aftermath, is now possible, thanks to a drip-feed of palace secrets by a few senior royals and other well-connected sources who have been stripped of their influence and wealth in the age of MBS and, in the worst cases, imprisoned and tortured. Key among those sources is a man named Saad Aljabri, Nayef’s closest adviser and intelligence chief. It was Aljabri whom Nayef texted immediately after he was released from the king’s palace, after the coup. Aljabri, 63, had long operated in the shadows and many who worked with him considered him the most powerful non-royal in Saudi Arabia. One former American official who worked with Aljabri for years described him to me as the “deep state liaison” between Saudi Arabia and western powers. In the years after 9/11, Aljabri had been promoted through the ranks of the interior ministry, eventually becoming head of counter-terrorism operations. Together, Aljabri and his patron, Nayef, modernised the kingdom’s security and surveillance apparatus. They have also been accused of targeting peaceful activists under the pretext of counter-terrorism and laying the foundations of the police state that MBS would later turn against them. The text messages between Nayef and Aljabri first came to light through legal filings in North America and an Interpol ruling that rejected a Saudi request to have Aljabri arrested overseas. The messages in those documents were authenticated by a digital forensics expert hired by Norton Rose Fulbright, the international law firm representing Aljabri, which is in possession of his iPhone, according to court affidavits. Aljabri’s team separately shared with me a handful of messages that have never previously been published. For decades, the throne had passed laterally between the sons of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the founder of the modern Saudi state, ensuring a delicate power balance between the various branches of the vast royal family. Nayef’s succession would have seen the crown passing to the generation below for the first time, but still to a different branch of the family, maintaining that delicate balance. But then came the palace coup – which not only shoved aside MBS’s main rival, but also destroyed the old succession model that prized seniority and consensus within the family, by setting up the passing of power directly from father to son within one branch of the family. It enabled MBS to amass more power than any previous ruler, even before he formally ascends the throne. The coup was the culmination of months of animus between MBS and Nayef. One of the major points of conflict was their competition to win favour with the new administration of President Donald Trump. People close to Nayef say he was secretly listening in on MBS’s calls with aides and allies such as Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser. The snooping helped him track MBS’s manoeuvres in Washington. The transcript of one intercepted call in the spring of 2017, which Nayef showed to Aljabri, suggested that MBS had been discussing the royal succession with Kushner. In that call, MBS told Kushner that he had cultivated close relationships with all US agencies “except three”. When Aljabri saw the transcript, he took the three agencies to mean the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency – institutions that had long favoured Nayef. To him and his patron, it was clear that MBS was trying to consolidate American support for his succession. In May 2017, Nayef attempted to make his own inroads into the Trump White House. He hired the Sonoran Policy Group, a lobbying firm in Washington with close ties to Trump’s team. Sonoran – which has since been renamed Stryk Global Diplomacy after its chairman, the lobbyist Robert Stryk – was hired to provide Nayef’s interior ministry “broad advisory services” in Washington. Nayef, people close to him said, understood that his past record did not count for much with a brash, unconventional president who would go on to have a strained relationship with the US intelligence community. Nayef wanted to impress on the new president that he was not just a longstanding partner, but a more valuable one than his cousin. Aljabri was directly involved in negotiating the $5.4m lobbying contract on behalf of the ministry. As news of the contract spread, Aljabri feared being caught between the warring princes. In May 2017, he quietly slipped away to Turkey, just days before Trump was due to visit Riyadh. Aljabri’s fears were well founded. Soon after he left, Aljabri said he got word that the main signatory of the contract – a secret service officer under Nayef – was detained by MBS loyalists and interrogated about the lobbying effort. On 4 June 2017, Aljabri texted Abdulaziz Howairini, a veteran security official, to ask whether he should continue “fasting in the cold”, a coded reference to remaining in Turkey. Howairini, who now reports to MBS, replied that he should. On 17 June, Howairini sent another text to Aljabri, warning him that the MBS loyalists were “very eager” to detain him as well. Meanwhile, furious pushback from MBS compelled Nayef to cancel the Stryk contract. According to Aljabri, Nayef warned him that MBS had seen the contract as a plot to torpedo his relationship with the Trump family and was out for blood. On 18 June, Aljabri received an abrupt text from MBS, asking him to return to Saudi Arabia to help resolve unspecified “conflicts” with Nayef. “I don’t think there’s anyone who understands [Nayef] better than you,” MBS wrote, his tone unusually conciliatory. There had been bad blood between MBS and Aljabri since 2015, when King Salman, apparently at the prince’s urging, fired Aljabri from his position for secretly meeting the then-CIA director John Brennan and then-British foreign secretary Philip Hammond without reporting the meetings to the monarch. However, Aljabri had continued working with Nayef informally, viewing his dismissal as one of MBS’s numerous attempts to weaken his patron. “Let us forget about the past,” MBS now insisted. “Are we children today? Forgive me and exonerate me before God. When are you coming back?” Aljabri replied that he needed to be away for medical treatment. Two days later, MBS launched the coup. * * * In the months after the coup, Aljabri continued to hunker down in Turkey. His immediate family was with him, except for two of his children who, on the day of the coup, had been prevented from boarding a flight in Riyadh. He secretly kept in contact with Nayef, whose movements were constrained. Meanwhile, MBS moved swiftly to tighten his grip on the security services, including the interior ministry, which was stripped of Nayef loyalists and key functions such as counter-terrorism. MBS came down heavily on any hint of public dissent. In his first major clampdown after the coup, influential clerics and intellectuals with huge social media followings were arrested in September 2017. That same month, Aljabri pleaded with MBS to allow his children to leave Saudi Arabia. But MBS insisted that Aljabri first return to discuss a “very sensitive file” related to Nayef. “Doctor, where should we dispatch the airplane to fetch you?” asked MBS in a text message. Aljabri had no intention of returning, but also sought to convince MBS that he posed no threat. In messages filled with obsequious platitudes, Aljabri pledged loyalty to MBS. “I possess lots of sensitive state information, but despite that I have never leaked anything to anyone,” Aljabri wrote. Rattling off examples of his loyalty, he wrote that he had publicly refuted the claims of “Mujtahid” – an anonymous royal whistleblower on Twitter who has long been a thorn in the side of the Saudi royal family. “What destiny awaits me were I to return [to Saudi]? Isn’t it better for me to remain outside the kingdom, where I remain faithful to your rule, refuse to say anything that would be harmful … and cooperate with Your Highness in everything that serves a common good?” MBS was unmoved. He texted Aljabri that he would pursue him “using all available means”. The threat prompted Aljabri to flee from Turkey to Canada later that month. In late 2017, Saudi Arabia tried to have Aljabri arrested through Interpol, alleging that he had stolen state funds worth billions, and pressed Canada to hand him over. Both efforts failed. Then, in October 2018, according to Aljabri, he received a warning from spies in a Middle Eastern country, who told him that he was an assassination target and urged him to stay away from Saudi embassies and consulates. (Aljabri requested the country’s name be withheld for fear of Saudi retribution.) That same month, Canadian border agents are thought to have intercepted and deported members of the Tiger Squad, a team of Saudi-sponsored hitmen, as they tried to enter the country on tourist visas. Riyadh denied any involvement but the alleged plot, implicitly acknowledged by Canadian authorities, bore chilling similarities to the way the Tiger Squad murdered the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the same month inside a Saudi diplomatic mission in Turkey. To the Americans who had worked with Aljabri, it was obvious that MBS saw him as a threat. Aljabri fleeing the kingdom was “like J Edgar Hoover’s deputy leaving DC and showing up in Moscow”, said the former US official who had worked with him. “Here’s a man liked by deep state organisations around the planet. He knows every foible, every misstep that Saudi royals have made.” * * * On a crisp winter morning last year, I was invited to a five-star hotel in Washington DC to meet Aljabri. He had travelled from Toronto to visit his son Khalid, a cardiologist and an informal spokesman for his reclusive father. When I arrived in the hotel lobby, my phone jangled with an unexpected message: “Let’s meet outside of the hotel.” Minutes later, a man appeared and whisked me to another high-rise in the area. Parked outside the residential tower, home to some of DC’s political elite, was an SUV marked “US Secret Service”. In an enclosed patio on the rooftop was Aljabri, dressed in a dark suit and wire-rimmed glasses. He was sitting on a couch, gazing at the view of downtown Washington. A wall-mounted fireplace radiated warmth and in the background, the faint warble of a grand piano could be heard. As I arrived, Aljabri stood up, Starbucks coffee in hand, and began by pointing out the landmarks: the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the White House. During the Trump presidency, Aljabri had avoided Washington DC, he said. He has plenty of influential friends here, including senators on both sides of the aisle and security officials. Even so, he was wary of the long arm of the Saudi state, and Trump’s warm relationship with MBS had made him even more wary. As we spoke, Aljabri, who holds a doctorate in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, mused about how different his life’s trajectory might have been had he not met Nayef. Aljabri began his career at the interior ministry in the 1990s. He once tried quitting for a job at Aramco, the state oil giant that is the biggest cash cow for the kingdom. Nayef stopped him. Now their destinies seem braided together. Since the coup, about 40 of Aljabri’s family members and close associates have been detained in Saudi Arabia in an attempt to coerce him into returning. His voice cracked as he pulled up photos on his phone of his incarcerated children, Sarah and Omar, now 22 and 24 respectively. They were arrested in March 2020, and convicted, in a closed trial, of money laundering and attempting to escape Saudi Arabia unlawfully. Aljabri’s son-in-law is also in detention. Aljabri said that if there were ever a chance for an exchange on a bridge – MBS on one end with his family, Aljabri on the other – he would do the trade in a heartbeat. “Take your ransom, release the hostages,” he said, imagining the scene. But he knows that is wishful thinking. In August 2020, after his children were jailed, Aljabri filed an explosive lawsuit in Washington, going public with his claim that MBS sent a death squad after him. (The judge would later remark that the lawsuit read like “the stuff of a Tom Clancy novel”.) Aljabri knows he cannot win against a powerful dictator, but the action could at the very least be what one of his associates described as a “pebble in MBS’s shoe”. In early 2021, the lawsuit triggered what Aljabri saw as retaliatory lawsuits in Boston and Ontario, filed by 10 Saudi state-linked firms initially established by Nayef to provide cover for US-Saudi operations and now controlled by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, of which MBS is the chairman. These companies accused Aljabri and his associates of defrauding them of $3.5bn. Aljabri denied any wrongdoing and said defending himself would require revealing the operations and finances of the companies, which were murky by design to support covert activities. Court documents filed in Boston by the US Justice Department suggest US officials were keen for an out-of-court settlement between Aljabri and MBS, apparently to prevent any public revelations about undercover American operations. But those efforts went nowhere. One US official, previously posted in the American mission in Riyadh, told me that the Saudis were not interested in settling because they are “not convinced Aljabri will remain silent”. In February this year, Aljabri made a new offer to MBS. In a letter to a senior royal court adviser, Aljabri offered a “financial and legal resolution”. (Aljabri’s team refused to discuss the specifics of the offer with me.) They sent the White House a memo requesting US officials to “urge the Saudi leadership to accept the restitution offer”. It was met with silence from MBS. MBS’s supporters say Aljabri’s eagerness for a financial settlement is tacit admission of his guilt. Aljabri’s team say that MBS’s unwillingness to settle proves that corruption is just a pretext to pursue a political opponent. Meanwhile, the legal battle drags on. In September, the Washington court dismissed Aljabri’s lawsuit against MBS, citing lack of personal jurisdiction. (Aljabri’s team are appealing against the decision.) Late last year, the Boston court threw out the lawsuit against Aljabri after the US government invoked the “state secrets privilege” to halt the disclosure of classified national security information. (The companies are fighting back.) But those secrets are still at risk of exposure in an Ontario court. Court filings from earlier this year show lawyers for the US government are working with their Canadian counterparts to prevent that outcome. But even if the lawsuits against Aljabri proceed, it could prove tricky to prove the corruption allegations conclusively. That’s because a key witness, the man who oversaw counter-terrorism spending, has disappeared: Nayef. * * * In late 2017, the conditions of Nayef’s house arrest were relaxed, but he was still barred from travelling outside the kingdom. Aljabri told me that Nayef had initially believed the worst that would happen to him was losing his official titles and receiving a handsome financial compensation in return. He expected to be treated the same way as his predecessor Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz, a former head of intelligence who was dismissed as crown prince in 2015. After King Salman fired him, according to a well-placed source, Prince Muqrin was lavished with farewell gifts, including a royal payout of about $800m, and the luxury yacht Solandge. By contrast, a large chunk of Nayef’s wealth was seized. On 10 December 2017, Nayef sent a letter to HSBC in Geneva asking that his “EUR, GBP, and USD balances” be transferred to a Saudi bank account. A source with knowledge of Nayef’s assets said his bankers and lawyers in Geneva ignored such requests, suspecting that the prince was acting under duress. (HSBC declined to comment when asked how it responded to the letter. The bank requested withholding the name of the official addressed in the letter, citing safety concerns.) The total value of Nayef’s overseas holdings is unclear. The prince’s associates say he owns prime real estate worth billions in Europe and the US. Nonetheless, what is certain is that Nayef had to surrender a substantial part of his domestic assets. The source with knowledge of these, who is based in Europe, provided a table with a breakdown of his “confiscated” companies and bank accounts – the total amount was $5.22bn. A separate source close to the prince shared what appeared to be a slightly less up-to-date spreadsheet with a similar breakdown. The “total value” confiscated, it said, was 17.8bn riyals, or $4.75bn. In 2018 and 2019, Nayef enjoyed relative freedom, even though he wasn’t allowed to leave the kingdom. His favourite activity, falconry in Algeria’s deserts, was out of the question, but he was allowed to go hunting inside Saudi Arabia. He showed up at royal weddings and funerals. One video that surfaced in late 2019 showed a group of supporters taking selfies with the prince and kissing his hand. Then, in March 2020, suddenly things got decidedly worse for Nayef. The government raided his desert retreat on the outskirts of Riyadh, and he was taken into detention. Several staff were also detained, the Europe-based source said. Nayef was kept in solitary confinement for more than six months. During that time, “he was seriously mistreated”, the source said. He alleged that Nayef was strung up his ankles and tortured. “As a consequence, he now has long-lasting damage to his lower legs and ankles, making walking painful. He lost a significant amount of weight.” Towards the end of 2020, according to the Europe-based source, Nayef was moved to a compound in the Yamamah palace complex in Riyadh, the king’s official residence and main seat of the Saudi government. He is not allowed outside his small unit and he is filmed and recorded at all times, the source said. He is not allowed visitors, except certain family members on rare occasions, nor can he see his personal doctor or legal representatives. He has been made to sign documents without reading them. In the spring of 2021, Nayef’s bankers and lawyers in Europe received new wealth transfer requests. They included a phone call from Nayef to his lawyer in Switzerland, according to a source privy to the discussion. The lawyer, to whom Nayef had previously granted power of attorney, refused, as he believed his client was under duress. The prince invited the lawyer to visit Saudi Arabia and verify for himself. Nayef “kept saying ‘I’m free, we’ll go out for dinner when you come to Riyadh’”, the source said. The lawyer insisted that Nayef needed to travel to Switzerland with his family to authorise the transfer in person. When reached by telephone, the lawyer told me that he could neither deny nor confirm the conversation, expressing concern about the potential repercussions of media engagement for his client. “The main reason that Nayef is being held is that the crown prince wrongly believes that he is a threat to the succession,” the Europe-based source said. “In also going after his money, MBS is attempting to humiliate Nayef so there is absolutely no threat of anyone seeing the former crown prince as a viable alternative.” * * * In a marble-bedecked luxury hotel in the heart of Riyadh, I met one of MBS’s most prominent spin doctors. Sitting next to him in the cafe was a senior royal court official, who stayed for part of the meeting. From our previous encounters, it was clear the spin doctor was part of a state-sponsored campaign to project MBS in the west as a visionary, boldly pushing through social reforms. He had wanted to talk about how the prince had lifted decades-old bans on women drivers and cinemas, allowed once-forbidden music concerts and curbed the power of the religious police who staunchly opposed mixing of the sexes. “MBS has balls,” he once told me. This time, an evening in March 2020, the spin doctor, hunched over a cup of coffee and a plate of crepes slathered with Nutella, wanted to set the record straight on Nayef’s recent disappearance. The Saudi government had offered no comment on why Nayef had been detained, along with another senior royal seen as a rival to MBS, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz. This meeting was the closest I would get to an official explanation. The spin doctor sought to dismiss a narrative playing out in the foreign media that the princes had been detained because the authorities believed they were plotting to unseat MBS and his father. MBS, he said, remained “in control” and the detentions were carried out “after an accumulation of negative behaviour by the two princes”. The sudden purge was meant to enforce “discipline” within the royal family. He did not elaborate on the nature of the “negative behaviour”, but said that the princes could be released soon. Nearly three years later, the princes are still in detention. “Both the Biden and the Trump administrations called for release of Mohammed bin Nayef … at the top of their talking points when engaging privately with Saudi leadership,” Kirsten Fontenrose, who briefly oversaw Gulf policy for the Trump administration, told the US House foreign affairs committee last year. “Mohammed bin Salman has been unmoved.” There are now no visible rivals left to the throne. MBS’s power appears absolute. On his current trajectory, there is nothing to stop him from succeeding his father as king. The global outcry over Khashoggi’s murder, the ruinous Saudi-led war in Yemen and growing repression at home – nothing seems to have shaken his hold on the country. Despite the reputational risks of doing business with a dictator, Wall Street executives are eager to strike deals with the rich petro-state. Activists fear a recent US decision to grant him sovereign immunity in a case concerning Khashoggi’s murder could further embolden him to go after critics. A royal family source, who privately denounced Nayef’s treatment but has remained silent in public to avoid retribution, told me that he would not be surprised if Nayef were to suddenly make an appearance in public someday alongside MBS, giving his blessing to the man who crushed him. Similar to the staged video after the 2017 coup, that would be another defining image of the age of MBS – and his violent rise to power. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/15/national-grid-talks-drax-coal-fired-units-selby-north-yorkshire-winter-outages","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-15T12:07:14Z","webTitle":"National Grid in talks with Drax to revive coal-fired units","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/15/national-grid-talks-drax-coal-fired-units-selby-north-yorkshire-winter-outages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/15/national-grid-talks-drax-coal-fired-units-selby-north-yorkshire-winter-outages","fields":{"bodyText":"National Grid has held talks with Drax over bringing two coal-fired units at its vast power plant in North Yorkshire out of retirement to prevent power cuts and confirmed it will again run its scheme to help avert blackouts this winter. While the grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) said that power plants and windfarms were expected to be able to generate more than enough to meet Great Britain’s needs, it will once again run its “demand flexibility service” that pays customers to reduce electricity use during peak times. ESO has discussed possibly restarting the Drax units, which were shut this year after 50 years of coal-fired power generation at the Selby site. Drax has converted four of the plant’s six units from coal to biomass in recent years and the final two units were kept available at the request of National Grid between October and March. It began decommissioning the units in April but the ESO said on Thursday that talks to keep them available for the winter were “ongoing”. “We are still in negotiations and we are working with Drax and with government,” said the ESO corporate affairs director, Jake Rigg. However, sources close to Drax said employees on the sites had already retired and work had begun on shutting down the units, meaning a restart was “very unlikely, although not impossible”. In its early view of winter conditions, the ESO forecast that electricity supply would outstrip demand this winter, with a forecast buffer of 4.8GW of power. That gives the system a margin of 8% – higher than last winter. “That’s really healthy. But even within that there will be tight days. There will be cold snaps in the winter and therefore we do expect to use our normal operational tools,” said Rigg. The ESO said it was watching energy market conditions “like hawks” amid concerns that the energy crisis linked to the war in Ukraine could flare up again this winter, causing electricity shortages. Last year the government scrambled to ensure security of energy supplies because of fears that a sudden reduction in Russian gas flows into Europe, combined with a cold snap, could cause rolling blackouts in the UK. Under the demand flexibility scheme introduced by the ESO, about 1.6m households and businesses on smart meters with participating suppliers received payments for moving power to non-peak hours, easing pressure on the grid equivalent to the energy to power 10m homes. The ESO also spent about £400m keeping Drax, Uniper’s Ratcliffe-on-Soar and EDF’s West Burton A coal plants on standby over the winter, to provide a back up if electricity supplies became tight. The energy secretary, Grant Shapps, said in February that it would be “crazy” not to have the plants on standby again this winter but EDF shut West Burton A as planned in late March. Ratcliffe remains open until September 2024, and was called into action this week during a surge in power demand as air conditioning units were used in the heat. Green campaigners criticised calling on coal to generate electricity during a heatwave rather than Britain’s renewable energy industry. Low wind power and maintenance on nuclear and undersea cables contributed to the tight supply conditions. Asked how central the Drax plant could be to supplies this winter, Rigg said: “It is a backstop. Ultimately, we are very much committed to decarbonisation of the electricity system but we also carry the responsibility to make sure electricity supplies are as reliable as possible. Our people in the control room take that responsibility very seriously.” A spokesperson for Drax played down the idea the coal units would be available this winter. He said: “As we announced in April, we have closed our coal units at Drax and have started the decommissioning process. Since then, we have had various discussions with government and ESO, but we are not in negotiations to extend their availability into the coming winter.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T22:00:09Z","webTitle":"Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip review – behold, TV’s glorious new power throuple!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","fields":{"bodyText":"It is an odd throuple, as Ruby Wax admits early on in her new three-part travel series, Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip (BBC One). “You might be thinking, what am I doing in the middle of the wild west with a Spice Girl and an actress?” she asks; presumably Wax, Melanie Brown and Emily Atack aren’t usual holiday mates. The answer is, of course, to pay tribute to a near-forgotten 19th-century female explorer named Isabella Bird, who made her way, on her own, across the Rocky Mountains in 1873. Bird is a personal hero of Wax’s, although why Brown and Atack are here is glossed over. They are trailblazers, too? That’ll do. It doesn’t really matter, because together they make for entertaining company. Wax reminded viewers of her calibre as a TV host with last year’s When Ruby Met ... retrospective, and she does have an uncanny ability to harness chaos at the same time as cause it. This makes her very watchable. Atack says she needs to get off Instagram and see the world, while Brown is there seemingly to keep an eye on Wax’s driving skills. If anyone remembers Maureen from Driving School, the comparison is not unfounded. They bicker like an old married couple (“Piss off, Ruby!”) and there is a familial dynamic here. It’s not unexpected when Atack calls one of them “mum”. The plan is that the women will take the same path Bird did, before veering off into other bits of Colorado to do a travelogue tinged with adventure, self-discovery and even self-care. I say self-care tentatively, because I know it has Gwyneth Paltrow connotations, and this isn’t as woo-woo or self-indulgent as that. But Bird was 41 and in ill health when she left Britain for an adventure in the hope that it would cure her maladies. Her health was much restored by her travels and she became famous in Colorado as “the Englishwoman who rode as well as a man”. This programme doesn’t make a song and dance of it, but Wax, 69, Brown, 47 and Atack, 32, have a number of conversations that suggest they are trying to make sense of how women should and could live today. This is intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that they come at it from different generations. Atack worries that her eggs are “dying”; Wax wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn’t felt the obligation to have children. The other is that they are entering into a traditionally macho, male world, although they do meet a number of female ranchers, who now make up one-third of all ranchers in the region. They wrangle cattle, climb mountains, visit bars and eat prairie oysters – which are emphatically not from the sea. More accurately, Atack eats them, and doesn’t much recoil when she’s told what they are. “The bollocks of an oyster?” she replies, which can be added to Jessica Simpson’s buffalo wings in TV’s history of unlikely cuts of meat. There’s a stagey scene in which the trio enter a small-town shop/bar, and the locals stop and stare, though I suspect the presence of a camera crew might have gone some way to grabbing their attention. Once they stop making Deliverance jokes, it gets much better. There are two standout sections, both of which involve less of the celebrity stuff, and more of them getting the stories of ordinary people. The first is Linda, who used her downtime during the pandemic to write a romantic fan-fiction style novel about Bird and her rumoured amour Mountain Jim, a “one-eyed desperado”. She seems delighted by how fantastically racy her own work is, as Wax reads selected parts, then goes on to describe the mountains as “like the kiss of a lover”. I want her to join the Trailblazers for the rest of their trip. The other highlight sees them spending time with Tim, a self-declared “mountain man”, who lives in a remote cabin only accessible by snowmobile for six months of the year. He talks about running it on solar power and spring water, the bears that have appeared on his porch, and taking from the land only what you need to survive. His personal history is moving and Wax teases it out of him beautifully. Then she hides in his wardrobe while Mel B breaks his desk. Atack, somehow ending up in a Saffy-from-Ab-Fab role, is dutifully collecting firewood and kindling outdoors. The mix of chaos and calm is entertaining and soothing. They gather round the fire and peace settles upon them. Judging by the teaser for next week, it doesn’t last long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-29T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"UK to lift import restrictions on food from Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","fields":{"bodyText":"Food from Fukushima will be freely available in the UK from Wednesday, weeks after Boris Johnson snacked on popcorn from the Japanese prefecture hit by a triple nuclear meltdown in March 2011. Britain restricted Fukushima imports after the disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, but has gradually lifted them, even as other countries limit or ban produce from the region. Johnson confirmed that the remaining restrictions would end on Wednesday in a meeting the previous day with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on the fringes of the G7 summit in Germany. Johnson told Kishida that UK-Japan relations were going from “strength to strength”. “Two great island democracies, united in our values, determined to stand up together against autocracies and the dangers of drifting backwards in the world, but also wanting to do more together on technology, on security, on trade, and of course I’m delighted that tomorrow – finally – we are able to have Fukushima-origin products all over the shops in the UK,” he said. The supermarket chains Tesco and Waitrose have said they have no immediate plans to sell Fukushima produce. Instead, many of the items will be available at Japanese restaurants and specialist Japanese stores in England, Scotland and Wales. The restrictions will remain in place in Northern Ireland, which is subject to European Union rules on food and drink from Fukushima and other prefectures affected by the accident 11 years ago. The scrapping of the restrictions was made possible after the UK Food Standards Agency dropped a limit of 100 becquerels – a measure of radioactivity – per kilogram contained in Japanese food. “Our risk assessment shows that removing the 100 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg) maximum level of radiocaesium for food imported from Japan to the UK would result in a negligible increase in dose and any associated risk to UK consumers,” the FSA said in a report late last year. The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs, such as meat and vegetables, is 100 becquerels per kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. The lifting of restrictions will affect 23 food products, such as mushrooms, which previously needed to carry proof that they had been tested for radioactive material, according to Nikkei Asia. The Japanese government said it “welcomes the fact that the UK government reached this decision based on scientific evidence, as it will support the reconstruction of the affected areas”. It added that it would “continue to work towards the early lifting of the remaining import restrictions in the EU and other countries and regions”. China, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and several other countries still impose import restrictions. Johnson first sampled Fukushima produce in 2017 when, as foreign secretary, he swigged a can of peach juice given to him by his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, declaring it “Yum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T01:23:34Z","webTitle":"Aukus submarine deal: Australia expected to choose UK design, sources say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/08/uk-to-unveil-nuclear-submarines-deal-with-australia-sources-say","fields":{"bodyText":"An enthusiastic Rishi Sunak has told ministers to expect a positive outcome next week when he travels to San Diego to unveil a deal to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia as part of the Aukus pact with the US. Multiple sources said they believed the UK had succeeded in its bid to sell British-designed nuclear submarines to Australia, a deal that will safeguard the long-term future of the shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness. A senior minister said Sunak had told colleagues he was delighted by the outcome of the negotiations, which have been going on for 18 months and have presented Australia with a choice between a British or a US design, based on the existing Astute or Virginia class submarines. “The deal has definitely gone our way. The prime minister was buzzing about it when he told ministers, smiling and bouncing on the balls of his feet,” the minister said. A second source outside government with knowledge of the talks said they had also been told to expect a British design success when the deal is announced on Monday, although any final submarine will also make heavy use of US technology. Sunak is due to travel to the west coast for a trilateral summit with Joe Biden, the US president, and Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, on Monday, where he also expected to unveil a refresh of Britain’s integrated review of defence and foreign policy in the light of the war in Ukraine. Supplying Australia with a nuclear-powered submarine was the centrepiece for the Aukus defence pact, announced in September 2021, with the US and UK agreeing to share secret reactor technology in a surprise deal, so Canberra could dump an alternative diesel-powered design from France. The expectation, one source indicated, was that Australia would work jointly on a design for a next generation submarine with the UK, evolving from the existing Astute submarine design, although it may not be seaworthy until the 2040s because of the complexity of the work. Further reports last night suggested that the short-term gap could be plugged by Australia buying up to five Virginia-class submarines from the US as part of the three-way deal. Meanwhile, an alternative plan that the UK could even be willing to sell or lease the two Astute class submarines yet to be completed at Barrow, HMS Agincourt and HMS Agamemnon, is wide of the mark. Naval analysts say the UK’s submarine fleet is already stretched and could not afford a sudden reduction. Australia will become the seventh country to have a nuclear-powered submarine, relying on an enriched uranium reactor, propulsion technology that will put the country’s diesel-powered navy on a technological par with China. But it will require Australia, which is not a nuclear power, to be supplied with a reactor, a move that Beijing has argued is a breach of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. The three Aukus powers say that is not the case, and that any reactors will be supplied “welded, shielded and sealed shut” according to Australian officials overseeing the effort. The new submarines will not carry nuclear weapons. But James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said it was not yet clear how the nuclear waste generated by the propulsion reactors will be dealt with – and whether that will happen in Australia or the UK or US. Defence experts said the time it would take to build the new submarines meant that there may be some related short-term developments. The US is keen to be able to base its nuclear submarines in Australia, making it easier to patrol the South Pacific, as it seeks to retain naval parity with China. A UK government spokesperson said: “When we announced the Aukus partnership in September 2021 we said there would be an 18-month scoping period to determine the optimal path to procuring Australia nuclear-powered submarines. The outcome of the scoping period is due to be announced soon.” A No 10 spokesperson said they could not pre-empt any future announcements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-22T13:30:39Z","webTitle":"Utes fan arrested after threatening to blow up nuclear reactor if team lost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2022/sep/22/utes-fan-arrested-after-threatening-to-blow-up-nuclear-reactor-if-team-lost","fields":{"bodyText":"A University of Utah student has been arrested after threatening to detonate a nuclear reactor on campus if the school’s football team lost to San Diego State.

When Rishi Sunak flies east this week to attend the G20 summit in New Delhi, he will be glad to put more than 4,000 miles between himself and the cost of living crunch, public services that are falling over and grisly opinion poll ratings. His international peer group will treat him with more courtesy than do many of his own MPs. Performing on what is loosely called “the world stage” will be a salve to the prime minister’s self-esteem. What else it will achieve is moot. There is little expectation that this G20 will come to much, not least because of the divisions between its western and non-western members about the war in Ukraine. It is being reported that Xi Jinping won’t even turn up, scotching earlier talk from Number 10 of a bilateral between Mr Sunak and China’s leader. The world will become “more insecure and more unstable” over the next decade, cautioned Ben Wallace in the valedictory letter he wrote to the prime minister to accompany his departure as defence secretary. We may hope he’s wrong, but a prudently robust foreign and security policy needs to be designed to address the peril that this warning will turn out to be accurate. The known risks include some highly scary ones, among them a wilting of western resolve to support Ukraine’s struggle for freedom, Donald Trump returning to the White House consumed by a lust to take revenge on his opponents domestic and foreign, and a Chinese lunge at Taiwan. This asks a question to which we currently have answers that are, at best, muddled: what precisely is the UK’s foreign and security policy? Inconsistent is the politest description of the approach to the world pursued over 13 years of Conservative government. Under David Cameron, “follow the money” was the motto. Most of the emphasis was placed on drumming up business for Britain, and the diplomatic corps were told to regard themselves as a sales force for UK plc. It was epitomised by rolling out acres of red carpet for Russian oligarchs, which doesn’t look awfully clever now, and the declaration of a “golden era” in relations with China, another concept which has aged extremely badly. During the time of Boris Johnson and the brief interregnum of Liz Truss, foreign policy was driven by the Brexiters’ delusions that a happy-go-lucky Britain would be free to go it alone in the world and do as it pleased. That notion has been smashed by contact with geopolitical reality. The swaggering braggadocio about “Global Britain” has been quietly consigned to oblivion by Mr Sunak. Both the soft power and the hard power of the UK have been diminished on the Tories’ watch. Andrew Mitchell, the development minister, has confessed that we are no longer a “development superpower” because of savage cuts to the aid budget. The global reach of the BBC’s World Service is declining amid reductions in its output and staff. The revolving chaos at Number 10, which saw three prime ministers in one year, had our ambassadors trying to persuade the world that the UK was not turning into a banana republic with lousy weather. While Mr Sunak is regarded as a more reliable performer on the world stage than his immediate predecessors, he suffers from the widespread expectation that he will be booted off the cast list within a year or so. The perception that his days in power are numbered gives international interlocutors less incentive to want to develop relationships with him. His allies respond that the prime minister has demonstrated he can put himself and Britain at the heart of major global debates by convening an international summit on the safety of artificial intelligence. It will meet at Bletchley Park, the Buckinghamshire home of Second World War code breakers, in November. Number 10 would like this summit to be regarded as a singular coup, with the potential to position Britain at the centre of efforts to regulate AI. That yearning rather betrays their anxieties about Mr Sunak being treated as a lame-duck prime minister abroad as well as at home. The UK was an early mover in support for Ukraine and has made substantial contributions of arms and munitions, but the effort has underscored frailties in our hard power. Britain is running out of kit that meets the needs of the Ukrainians. The British army is shrinking to its smallest size since the end of the Napoleonic wars. Mr Wallace’s parting shot was that a muscular military should be treated not as an optional extra but as an absolute imperative: “We must not return to the days where defence was viewed as a discretionary spend by government and savings were achieved by hollowing out.” The appointment of Grant Shapps as the new defence secretary, his fifth cabinet post in 12 months, has angered some Conservative MPs and caused consternation among military figures because he has no expertise in the area. His loyalty to Mr Sunak and pedigree as a political attack-dog are the main reasons Mr Shapps landed the role. To some I have talked to, this appointment exposes the prime minister as a man who is not fundamentally serious about defence and security, even at a time of the largest war in Europe since 1945. His friends depict Mr Sunak as a realist and a pragmatist who sees foreign policy through the prisms of problem-solving and relationship management. Number 10 is unapologetic about issuing an invitation to Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, to visit Downing Street this autumn. James Cleverly’s recent trip to Beijing, the first by a British foreign secretary in five years, was defended on the grounds that the UK has to “engage” with big powers, even those with grotesque records on human rights and menacing global ambitions. That inflamed the divide about China within the Conservative party. The former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith was among those to accuse his own government of “appeasement” of Beijing. A withering report by the foreign affairs select committee complained that the UK government’s China strategy is so highly classified that details have not been shared with some relevant ministers and officials. It occurs to me that things may be even worse than the committee thinks. It could be that the China policy is being kept so secret because the government doesn’t actually have a plan with enough coherence to deserve to be called a strategy. Mr Sunak is keen on closer ties with India. The economic growth of India is pacey, it has overtaken China to become the world’s most populous country and it is gaining geopolitical clout. Indian ambitions were highlighted by landing a spacecraft near the south pole of the moon and there are many familial links with the UK. Yet there are also considerable tensions in that relationship and at several levels. India has been strategically ambivalent on the war in Ukraine while massively increasing its purchases of Russian oil since Vladimir Putin ordered his brutal invasion. Cleaving closely to Washington has for decades been the lodestar of British defence and foreign policy, but there’s a growing view within Whitehall that the US can no longer be regarded as an all-weather ally. Relations with Joe Biden’s White House are cool and the UK needs to be thinking about how it would handle a return to the Oval Office by Mr Trump. Just because that seems insane, it doesn’t mean it is entirelyinconceivable. As a cash-strapped, midsized power in a dangerously unpredictable and unstable world, the UK needs to be smart at making and keeping friends, especially with other liberal democracies with similar values. Which brings us to our nearest neighbours. Relations with EU countries have become less poisonous since Mr Sunak moved into Number 10. There’s been some recovery from the depths of distrust towards the UK which were plumbed under Boris Johnson. The main product has been the Windsor agreement, which resolved a two-year stand-off about the rules governing trade between the mainland UK and Northern Ireland. Yet there’s still a distinct frost. Mr Sunak has been unrequited in his desperate desire to secure a returns agreement with the EU covering migrants crossing the Channel or using other unauthorised routes. Brexit has made Britain less relevant to the EU, and to all the other significant players of the world. There’s no escaping that bitter truth, however many air miles Mr Sunak clocks up. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T00:50:11Z","webTitle":"Albanese budget scraps ‘risky’ Coalition plan to underwrite new power generation ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/albanese-budget-quietly-scraps-coalition-underwrite-new-power-generation-fossil-fuels-power-prices","fields":{"bodyText":"The Albanese government has scrapped the Coalition’s electricity underwriting scheme. Critics had warned it could cost billions to prop up fossil fuels and would push up power prices. On Monday, the industry minister, Ed Husic, repealed the instrument that enabled federal funding for energy generation projects, a pet scheme of the former Liberal energy minister Angus Taylor. The program was widely panned for delays in implementation, exposing taxpayers to billions of dollars worth of liabilities by guaranteeing a minimum price for dispatchable power, and competing with new-generation investments including the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup Taylor and the then prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced the electricity underwriting scheme in December 2018, prompting criticism from the Australian Industry Group for its “inadequate approach to integrating emissions and energy policy”. In March 2019, the Morrison government announced a shortlist of 12 projects including six pumped hydro plants, five gas generators and an upgrade to the Vales Point coal-fired power plant proposed by coal baron and LNP donor Trevor St Baker. But three years later, industry and energy department officials conceded no projects had been funded through the scheme. The explanatory memorandum for the repeal confirms that “no projects have been delivered and no underwriting commitments have been made”. “The [underwriting] program has now been closed because it was unlikely to achieve its objectives,” it said. In March 2022 Labor and the Greens voted in the Senate to disallow the program’s funding, but were blocked by the Coalition and One Nation. Labor’s Louise Pratt said the program “lacks both transparency and integrity”. “It has given disgraced minister Angus Taylor a blank cheque to fund pet projects without due process,” Pratt told the Senate. “Industry and experts tell us that it will push up power prices and expose taxpayers to risky investments.” Pratt noted the Business Council of Australia had warned that “ad hoc intervention in the energy market, such as underwriting generation investment … will only result in less investment in energy generation, less reliable energy and ultimately higher prices”. “We support the role that gas will play in a transition in energy but support for any projects – gas or pumped hydro – needs to be considered through a proper process, not through a Coalition slush fund such as this one.” The Australian National Audit Office is considering an audit of the electricity underwriting program after a referral from independent MP Zali Steggall."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/09/us-power-grid-pacific-northwest-attacks","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-10T06:00:55Z","webTitle":"Attacks on Pacific north-west power stations raise fears for US electric grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/09/us-power-grid-pacific-northwest-attacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/09/us-power-grid-pacific-northwest-attacks","fields":{"bodyText":"A string of attacks on power facilities in Oregon and Washington has caused alarm and highlighted the vulnerabilities of the US electric grid. The attacks in the Pacific north-west are similar to the assault on North Carolina power stations that cut electricity to 40,000 people. As first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting and KUOW Public Radio, there have been at least six attacks, some of which involved firearms and caused residents to lose power. Two of the attacks shared similarities with the incident in Moore county, North Carolina, where two stations were hit by gunfire. Authorities have not yet revealed a motive for the North Carolina attack. The four Pacific north-west utilities whose equipment was attacked have said they are cooperating with the FBI. The agency has not yet confirmed if it is investigating the incidents. It’s unknown who is behind the attacks but experts have long warned of discussion among extremists of disrupting the nation’s power grid. Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) said in a statement on Thursday that it was seeking tips about “trespassing, vandalism and malicious damage of equipment” at a substation in Clackamas county on 24 November that caused damage and required cleanup costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. “Someone clearly wanted to damage equipment and, possibly, cause a power outage,” said John Lahti, the utility’s transmission vice-president of field services. “We were fortunate to avoid any power supply disruption, which would have jeopardized public safety, increased financial damages and presented challenges to the community on a holiday.” Any attack on electric infrastructure “potentially puts the safety of the public and our workers at risk”, said BPA, which delivers hydropower across the Pacific north-west . Portland General Electric, a public utility that provides electricity to nearly half of the state’s population, said it had begun repairs after suffering “a deliberate physical attack on one of our substations” that also occurred in the Clackamas area in late November 2022. It said it was “actively cooperating” with the FBI. Puget Sound Energy, an energy utility in Washington, reported two cases of vandalism at two substations in late November to the FBI and peer utilities, but said the incidents appeared to be unrelated to other recent attacks. “There is no indication that these vandalism attempts indicate a greater risk to our operations and we have extensive measures to monitor, protect and minimize the risk to our equipment and infrastructure,” the company said in a statement. Experts and intelligence analysts have long warned of both the vulnerability of the US power grid and talk among extremists about attacking the crucial infrastructure. “It’s very vulnerable,” said Keith Taylor, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who has worked with energy utilities. “[These attacks] are a real threat.” The physical risks to the power grid have been known for decades, Granger Morgan, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told CBS. “We’ve made a bit of progress, but the system is still quite vulnerable,” he said. A US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report released in January warned that domestic extremists have been developing “credible, specific plans” to attack electricity infrastructure since at least 2020. The DHS has cited a document shared on a Telegram channel used by extremists that included a white supremacist guide to attacking an electric grid with firearms, CNN reported. “These fringe groups have been talking about this for a long time,” Taylor said. “I’m not at all surprised this happened – I’m surprised it’s taken this long.” Three men who law enforcement identified as members of the Boogaloo movement allegedly planned to attack a substation in Nevada in 2020 to distract police and attempt to incite a riot. In 2013, still unknown assailants cut fiber-optic phone lines and used a sniper to fire shots at a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric substation near San Jose in what appeared to be a carefully planned attack that caused millions of dollars in damage. The attack prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) to order grid operators to increase security. “They knew what they were doing. They had a specific objective. They wanted to knock out the substation,” Jon Wellinghoff, the then chair of Ferc, told 60 Minutes, adding that the attack could have “brought down all of Silicon Valley”. After the 2013 attack in California, a Ferc analysis found that attackers could cause a blackout coast-to-coast if they took out only nine of the 55,000 substations in the US. The US electrical grid is vast and sprawling with 450,000 miles of transmission lines, 55,000 substations and 6,400 power plants. Power plants and substations are dispersed in every corner of the country, connected by transmission lines that transport electricity through farmland, forests and swamps. Attackers do not necessarily have to get close to cause significant damage. “In a centralized system, if I [want] to take out one coal-fired plant, I don’t even have to take out the plant, I just have to take out the transmission line,” said Taylor. “You can cause a ripple effect where one outage can cause an entire seaboard to go down.” The Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/02/us-russia-putin-ukraine-war-david-petraeus","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-02T18:56:18Z","webTitle":"Petraeus: US would destroy Russia’s troops if Putin uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/02/us-russia-putin-ukraine-war-david-petraeus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/02/us-russia-putin-ukraine-war-david-petraeus","fields":{"bodyText":"The US and its allies would destroy Russia’s troops and equipment in Ukraine – as well as sink its Black Sea fleet – if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, uses nuclear weapons in the country, former CIA director and retired four-star army general David Petraeus warned on Sunday. Petraeus said that he had not spoken to national security adviser Jake Sullivan on the likely US response to nuclear escalation from Russia, which administration officials have said has been repeatedly communicated to Moscow. He told ABC News: “Just to give you a hypothetical, we would respond by leading a Nato – a collective – effort that would take out every Russian conventional force that we can see and identify on the battlefield in Ukraine and also in Crimea and every ship in the Black Sea.” The warning comes days after Putin expressed views that many have interpreted as a threat of a larger war between Russia and the west. Asked if the use of nuclear weapons by Russia in Ukraine would bring America and Nato into the war, Petraeus said that it would not be a situation triggering the alliance’s Article 5, which calls for a collective defense. That is because Ukraine is not part of Nato – nonetheless, a “US and Nato response” would be in order, Petraeus said. Petraeus acknowledged that the likelihood that radiation would extend to Nato countries under the Article 5 umbrella could perhaps be construed as an attack on a Nato member. “Perhaps you can make that case,” he said. “The other case is that this is so horrific that there has to be a response – it cannot go unanswered.” Yet, Petraeus added, “You don’t want to, again, get into a nuclear escalation here. But you have to show that this cannot be accepted in any way.” Nonetheless, with pressure mounting on Putin after Ukrainian gains in the east of the country under last week’s annexation declaration and resistance to mobilization efforts within Russia mounting, Petraeus said Moscow’s leader was “desperate”. “The battlefield reality he faces is, I think, irreversible,” he said. “No amount of shambolic mobilization, which is the only way to describe it; no amount of annexation; no amount of even veiled nuclear threats can actually get him out of this particular situation. “At some point there’s going to have to be recognition of that. At some point there’s going to have to be some kind of beginning of negotiations, as [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy has said, will be the ultimate end.” But, Petraeus warned, “It can still get worse for Putin and for Russia. And even the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield won’t change this at all.” Still, he added, “You have to take the threat seriously.” Senator Marco Rubio, the ranking Republican member of the Senate foreign relations committee, told CNN that Putin was down to two choices: established defensive lines or withdraw and lose territory. Rubio said he believed it “quite possible” that Putin could strike distribution points where US and allied supplies are entering Ukraine, including inside Poland. The senator acknowledged the nuclear threat, but he said most worries about “a Russian attack inside Nato territory, for example, aiming at the airport in Poland or some other distribution point”. “Nato will have to respond to it,” he said. “How it will respond, I think a lot of it will depend on the nature of the attack and the scale and scope of it.” But as a senator privy to Pentagon briefings, Rubio resisted being drawn on whether he’d seen evidence that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. “Certainly, the risk is probably higher today than it was a month ago,” Rubio said, predicting that Russia would probably take an intermediate step. “He may strike one of these logistical points. And that logistical point may not be inside … Ukraine. To me, that is the area that I focus on the most, because it has a tactical aspect to it. And I think he probably views it as less escalatory. Nato may not.” • This article was amended on 3 October 2022 to correct several misspellings of David Petraeus’s name."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/16/facing-dependence-on-china-eu-battles-to-support-green-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-16T12:00:47Z","webTitle":"‘We are facing dependence on China’: EU battles to support green industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/16/facing-dependence-on-china-eu-battles-to-support-green-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/16/facing-dependence-on-china-eu-battles-to-support-green-industry","fields":{"bodyText":"Europe is struggling to support green industries one year after the US passed a law to boost technologies needed to stop the planet heating. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers companies hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to make clean technologies in the US, prompted EU officials in March to support homegrown manufacturing in sectors crucial to cleaning up the economy. But analysts and industry groups say their response has been stymied by a lack of cash and coordination. “It’s very much the EU masquerading as if it is doing industrial policy,” said Johanna Lehne, an analyst at the climate thinktank E3G. “When you look into the package itself – the fact that there is no new funding, that they are basically leaving it up to member states, that they haven’t been able to create a really cohesive and coordinated approach – it’s not more than the sum of its parts.” Under its green deal industrial plan, the EU has announced a target to make 40% of “strategic net zero technologies” within its borders by 2030. It has loosened rules that stop member states giving money to industries and plans to cut red tape that holds back companies waiting for permits to build clean energy projects. The European Commission also wants member states to add €10bn (£8.6bn) to existing pots of funding in the hope the money will encourage €160bn of investments, including those from the private sector. In the US, the IRA is expected to provide at least €350bn in federal spending alone. “The big gamechanger that the IRA brought was this immense amount of funding, and there we are falling way behind,” said Niklas Nienaß, a German MEP with the Green party. “I would call [the EU response] a sleight of hand. The magician shows you this card, the IRA response you are looking for, but in fact we have just shifted one card for another.” EU officials do not have control over budgets on the scale of the US or China. They have also been reluctant to let member states subsidise industries themselves because they fear it would distort the single market. Richer countries such as France and Germany have more money to help domestic companies than poorer ones such as Romania and Bulgaria. Despite this, the EU has temporarily loosened state aid rules, a process that started during the Covid-19 pandemic and sped up after Russia invaded Ukraine. But the commission has rejected the idea of “unrestricted subsidies” and said it would rather help green industries by playing to the strengths of the single market. “Europe is very good at rule setting,” said Frauke Thies, the head of the climate thinktank Agora Energiewende. “I think we should also recognise that this, dull as it may sound, is a real advantage.” The EU has some of the highest environmental standards in the world and its regulations are sometimes adopted by other governments. For companies who sell their goods around the world, it is often worth complying with EU rules everywhere rather than manufacturing different versions of the same product. “Europe has a very strong legislative track record on this that the US can’t replicate,” said Lehne from E3G. “Both sides are able to provide something. On the US side, you have the cash. On the EU side, you have the rules.” But the rules have sometimes frustrated its own industries. Clean energy companies have criticised the EU’s funding proposals not just for being smaller than the uncapped US tax credits, but also harder to access, with longer wait times. They also worry the funding arrangements are too closely linked to the innovation fund, which the EU has used to bring clean technologies out of the lab and on to the market. “This is not about innovation, it’s not a technology challenge, it’s a pure volume challenge,” said Giles Dickson, the CEO of the industry lobby group WindEurope. To meet targets from national governments, he added, Europe must add 20GW of offshore wind turbine capacity a year from 2027, but can only build and install enough turbines itself to add 7GW a year. “We’ve had 30 years of innovation, we have very advanced turbines. We just need more factories to build more of them.” The European parliament and council are now fighting over the European Commission’s industrial plan before it comes into force. A parliamentary committee on industry, research and energy has proposed deleting lines in the text that specify which technologies to support. Christian Ehler, a German MEP from the centre-right European parliamentary party grouping who is in charge of the file, has called to shift the plan’s focus to cover all technologies that can help cut emissions, not just the ones highlighted by the commission. A coalition of clean technology groups, including electricity grid operators and battery makers, has said that widening the scope would seriously weaken the proposal. “China has shown very clearly that focusing on a few key technologies and pushing for them is what made them a leader,” said Walburga Hemetsberger, the CEO of the industry lobby group SolarPower Europe. “We need to invest in those technologies that will be decisive for our future economies,” she added. “We cannot just put our heads in the sand any more and hope that someone else is doing it for us.” EU officials are not just worried about clean technology companies moving factories to the US. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking an energy crisis across the continent and beyond, European governments have grown more sensitive to the dangers of depending heavily on one country for key supplies, as they did with Russian gas. Global supply chains for clean technologies draw heavily from just a handful of countries. China supplies 60% of rare earth elements and refines 90% of them, according to the International Energy Agency. It also refines 60-70% of lithium and cobalt, which are needed in huge volumes to make electric batteries. “We are facing dependence, particularly on China,” said Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a French MEP with the market-liberal Renew Europe group. “The European Union’s desire, which is shared by the commission and parliament, is really to diversify supply and control the integrity of the supply chain.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T19:59:17Z","webTitle":"Pressure on west to act grows after report on Iranian uranium enrichment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/28/pressure-on-west-to-act-grows-after-report-on-iranian-uranium-enrichment","fields":{"bodyText":"Iran has enriched uranium particles up to just short of weapons grade, placing further pressure on western powers to issue a third censure of Iran at a meeting of the nuclear watchdog board next week. In its quarterly report to the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Association, officials also revealed that the restrictions placed on its inspectors meant it would take a considerable time to provide a full inventory or history of Iran’s enrichment process. Iran has said the uranium particles, enriched to up to 83.7% purity, had occurred during the “transition period at the time of commissioning the process of [60%] product (November 2022) or while replacing the feed cylinder”. But the IAEA’s faith in Iran’s reassurances in the absence of corroborative evidence is at an all-time low, and will only encourage Israel to encourage the west to endorse a military assault on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Speaking in Berlin, Israel’s visiting foreign minister, Eli Cohen, claimed there were only two options to deal with Iran: using a so-called “snapback” mechanism to reinstate wider UN sanctions on Iran; and “to have a credible military option on the table as well”. But at the weekend, Bill Burns, the CIA director, continued to insist US intelligence did not have evidence that Iran had taken a weaponisation decision. The latest IAEA report to the board speaks about “particles”, suggesting it does not believe that Iran as a matter of policy is yet building a stockpile of uranium enriched above 60% – the level it has been enriching at from some time. The report finds the stockpile of uranium enriched at 60%, for which there is no known civilian nuclear use, has risen since the last report to the board. It estimated Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was 3,760.8kg (8,291lbs) as of 12 February. The limit set in the 2015 nuclear deal was set at 202.8kg of uranium, but that limit has been breached for many years by Iran. On Monday in Geneva, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, insisted Tehran was willing to revive the nuclear deal, but the country’s leadership is riven about the wisdom of doing so. The US has said the revival of the talks is not its current focus. The west is under intense pressure to break off the talks, and instead to proscribe the Revolutionary Guardsin response to the suppression of Iranian street protests. In practice, the west has said it will not revive the deal until Iran explains to the IAEA’s satisfaction about the origins of nuclear particles found at three old but undeclared sites. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general, is unlikely to go to Tehran unless he knows he is going to be given a fuller explanation than on his previous visits. Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal limited Tehran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant. The US unilateral withdrawal from the accord under Donald Trump’s presidency in 2018 set in motion a series of attacks and escalations by Tehran over its program."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
