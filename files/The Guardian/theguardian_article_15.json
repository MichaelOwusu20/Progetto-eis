As of Monday, 36 million people are under excessive heat warnings in the US, particularly in the south and western regions. Record high temperatures in some places will likely remain as many gear up to celebrate the Independence Day holiday on Tuesday. A large swath of the US, from northern California through Washington state, will bake under intense heat for multiple days this week. Many midwest cities are also dealing with the aftermath of severe rain and flooding. Weekend thunderstorms in Chicago flooded streets and highways, as nearly nine inches of rain fell in some areas of the city in just a few hours. Many in the midwest are still without power after the weekend storms. A 33-year-old woman died in her parked car in St Louis when a tree fell on the vehicle, and a five-year-old boy was killed in his bedroom when a tree fell on his house in Jennings, Missouri, in St Louis county. More wildfire smoke is expected to return to the northern states of the US, less than a week after smoke from Canadian wildfires resulted in hazy skies and dangerous air quality across the US midwest and north-east. A woman has died due to heat-related issues while on a hike at Grand Canyon national park, according to authorities. The hiker, identified as a 57-year-old woman, was attempting an eight-mile hike when she fell unconscious, a park release said. Park officials said the high temperature at Tuweep was well over 100F (37C) degrees on Sunday. The target of keeping long-term global warming within 1.5C (2.7F) is moving out of reach, climate experts have warned, with countries failing to set more ambitious goals despite months of record-breaking heat on land and sea. The target of keeping long-term global warming within 1.5C (2.7F) is moving out of reach, climate experts have warned, with countries failing to set more ambitious goals despite months of record-breaking heat on land and sea, Reuters reported. As climate envoys from the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters prepare to meet next month, the Chinese capital of Beijing saw record-breaking temperatures for the month, while parts of the US have been gripped by a prolonged heatwave for weeks. The World Meteorological Organization has predicted a 66% likelihood that global temperatures will breach 1.5C for at least one whole year between now and 2027. “Very unusual”, “worrying”, “terrifying” and “bonkers”: the reactions of veteran scientists to the sharp increase in north Atlantic surface temperatures over the past three months raise the question of whether the world’s climate has entered a more erratic and dangerous phase with the onset of an El Niño event on top of human-made global heating. Since April, the warming appears to have entered a new trajectory. Meanwhile, the area of global sea ice has dropped by more than 1m sq km (390,000 sq miles) below the previous low. “If a few decades ago, some people might have thought climate change was a relatively slow-moving phenomenon, we are now witnessing our climate changing at a terrifying rate,” said Prof Peter Stott, who leads the UK Met Office’s climate monitoring and attribution team. As the El Niño builds through the rest of this year, adding an extra oomph to the damaging effects of human-induced global heating, many millions of people across the planet and many diverse ecosystems are going to face extraordinary challenges and unfortunately suffer great damage. The El Niño climate pattern emerges when normal easterly winds weaken and warm water spreads across the whole Pacific. The immediate impact is on marine life which is unaccustomed to waters that have warmed by several degrees in some areas. More worrying still, the extra energy in the ocean, which is the world’s biggest heat absorber, may bring fiercer-than-usual storms, more destructive rain dumps and longer, hotter heatwaves. Read the full story here. High temperatures will soar to levels well above the historical average during the Fourth of July and beyond, forecasters say. Intense summer heat will increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, as people host outdoor parties, head out to cool off at the pool or lake, watch fireworks displays or even participate in holiday races. AccuWeather meteorologist Nicole LoBiondo said: The heat is due to a northward bulge of the jet stream that will allow a heat dome to develop over the northwestern US and western British Columbia, Canada. A large swath of the US, from Northern California through Washington state, will bake under intense heat for multiple days this week. LoBiondo continued: High temperatures through at least Wednesday are setting up to run 10–20 degrees Fahrenheit above the historical average for this time of year. Record high temperatures will be challenged from Medford, Oregon, to the southwestern Canadian coast. A severe thunderstorm watch is in effect for portions of north-eastern Wyoming, south-eastern Montana, and western South Dakota, the National Weather Service said. A woman has died due to heat-related issues while on a hike at Grand Canyon national park, according to authorities. A park ranger was notified at about 6.30pm on Sunday that a hiker was in need of help in the remote Tuweep area of the park, park officials said. The hiker, identified as a 57-year-old woman, was attempting an 8-mile hike when she became unconscious, a park release said. A park ranger arrived at her location at about 1am on Monday and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Park officials said the high temperature at Tuweep was well over 100F (37C) degrees on Sunday. The National Park Service and the Mohave county medical examiner are investigating the incident. In Canada, crews are working to survey the damage after a tornado touched down north of Calgary on Saturday, destroying a number of homes and damaging others. A handful of homes were completely flattened by the twister that tore a path of destruction between the towns of Carstairs and Didsbury, CBC reported. No one was seriously injured by the storm, but a woman was found trapped in her basement after the tornado destroyed her house. Farm buildings and power infrastructure were also damaged or destroyed. Elisa Humphreys got in her car with her dog and cat and fled moments before the tornado destroyed her home on Saturday afternoon. When she returned, there was nothing but debris left. Humphreys told CBC News: There’s nothing here, there’s nothing here, it’s all gone. It almost looks like airplanes crashed here, but what it is, is the total destruction of two homes that have just been shredded and spread everywhere. Less than a week after smoke from Canadian wildfires resulted in hazy skies and dangerous air quality across the US midwest and north-east, more wildfire smoke is expected to return to cover a broader scope across the northern states. As of Monday, more than 500 active fires were burning across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). Of the fires active on Monday, at least 284 were considered to be “out of control”. By Monday morning, the total acreage burned this year was over 20.7m. Smoke is forecast to shift out of the Canadian Rockies and prairies into the neighboring northern plains and north-west US, leading to poor air quality and low visibility, AccuWeather reported. The smoke is forecast to reach cities like Seattle; Helena, Montana; and Grand Forks, North Dakota. Later in the week, there is some smoke risk and the potential for poor air quality to return as a surface high slides into the upper midwest, bringing a northern wind into the region and in the north-east, according to the AccuWeather meteorologist Joseph Bauer. He said: The general pattern through at least the middle portion of the month is supportive of having more episodes of smoke enter the Midwest and Northeast from Canada. As a result, more occurrences of poor air quality and hazy skies can occur in these areas more frequently. A weekend wildfire in southwestern Washington has grown to 533 acres and destroyed an undetermined number of structures, according to officials. Skamania county firefighters responded to reports of the wildfire on Sunday at about 11am, AP reports. Hot, windy conditions caused the fire to spread rapidly through the afternoon, prompting authorities to order residents in the area to evacuate. As of Monday morning, a total of 166 fire personnel were engaged with the fire, which is 0% contained. The fire threatens hundreds of residences, a fish hatchery and vineyards, the Seattle Times reported. The fire’s cause is under investigation. Intense storm conditions this weekend caused flooding in the Chicago area, shutting down interstates and trapping drivers attempting to navigate flooded areas. Here is more on how a heat dome hovering over parts of the south are increasing temperatures in New Orleans, from Sarah Sneath for the Guardian: After service ended at the New Philippians Missionary Baptist church in the lower ninth ward of New Orleans on Sunday, the church kept its doors open for people from the neighborhood who needed a break from the heat. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. On Sunday, heat index values threatened to hit 110F in New Orleans, according to the National Weather Service. The sermon in church that morning was about letting go. “Psalm 37 starts out with ‘Fret not thyself because of evildoers,’” said Pastor Anthony Jeanmarie III. “It’s just encouraging us as believers that things in life happen to us sometimes that are of ill intent, but our job is not to focus on the person or the problem.” But Mother Nature herself did not want to let go or let up, with a heat advisory expected to last through Tuesday. Heat index readings reached as high as 120F last week and evening temperatures in the 80s offered little reprieve. “This heat is disrespectful,” said church secretary Thelma Curtis. The city of New Orleans announced that cooling centers, including the New Philippians Missionary Baptist church, will be open for residents to escape the heat throughout the weekend. Louisiana’s high humidity makes it even harder for the body to cool down during high temperatures, said Alicia Van Doren, who helped write a recent report for the Louisiana department of health about heat-related illnesses in the state.

A 33-year-old woman died in her parked car in St Louis when a tree fell on the vehicle, AP News reported. A five-year-old boy was killed in his bedroom when a tree fell on his house in Jennings, Missouri, in St Louis County. The heating of the earth’s atmosphere and oceans by the burning of fossil fuels made the current extreme heatwave across the us at least five times more likely, according to a recent analysis by Climate Central, a climate science non-profit. The rolling heatwave marks the latest in a series of recent extreme “heat dome” events that have scorched various parts of the world. This heat dome was formed by a high-pressure atmospheric system that created a sinking column of warming air that trapped latent heat already absorbed by the landscape, like a sort of lid. Such events typically occur without rain and are cloudless, allowing the sun to bake the surface unhindered, causing temperatures to spike. “The heat evaporates water and then just heats up the land,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University. If you have this sort of high-pressure system sitting stationary over a region, you can have these really impressive heatwaves. Heat domes have long existed in Texas, and elsewhere, and there is some conjecture among scientists as to whether or not the climate crisis is causing more “blocking events” where patches of high pressure are held in place by alterations to a jet stream that normally pushes weather systems from west to east. “But when these heat domes do happen, they are getting worse, that’s for certain,” said Michael Wehner, a climate and extreme weather expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who estimated that the Texas heatwave was made around 2.7C (5F) hotter by human-caused global heating. A swath of severe wind gusts and isolated very large hail are probable across a portion of northeast Wyoming into western South Dakota, according to the National Storm Prediction Center. Scattered damaging winds from strong to isolated severe gusts are likely across parts of the lower mid-Atlantic states through early evening, it says. As of Monday afternoon, nearly 200,000 homes and businesses are without power, including nearly 50,000 in Missouri, according to Poweroutage.us. More than 30 cows were killed on Saturday in a northern Alabama town when lightning struck the tree they were hiding under, according to officials. WVTM reported that the beef cattle were sheltering from a severe storm on Daymin Gardner’s farm in Berlin, when lightning struck the tree. The father’s brother told WVTM that the meat on the cows was not salvageable and they would be given a proper burial. Saturday’s storms brought torrential rain, hail and lightning to central Alabama. The National Weather Service (NWS) said seeking shelter under a tree is one of the leading causes of lightning-related fatalities. More than 80m people are under severe storm threat ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, CNN reported. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected through much of the eastern US, with chances of flash flooding in some areas from the lower Great Lakes to southern New England, the National Weather Service said in an update Monday. A slight risk for severe storms, level two of five, stretches from northern South Carolina to southern New Jersey, including Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charlotte, Washington DC and Virginia Beach. Cities including Jackson, Birmingham, Atlanta, Charleston, Roanoke, Newark and New York are all under a marginal risk for severe storms. A separate storm system is bringing another slight risk of severe weather across parts of the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana and Minnesota. NBC news cited the National Weather Service as saying: The chance of showers and thunderstorms will generally decrease through the eastern US on Independence Day as the low pressure system is forecast to weaken further. Weekend thunderstorms in Chicago flooded streets and highways on Sunday, forcing Nascar officials to call off the remainder of the Xfinity Series race in the city’s downtown area. The National Weather Service recorded 3.35in of rain on Sunday, shattering the city’s previous record for that day of 2.06in set in 1982. Some parts of the Chicago area received up to 9in during the storm on Sunday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. To put it into perspective, the average amount of rain in July for the city is 3.7in, the paper said. The Nascar Cup Series main event began late in the day on Sunday due to local flash flood warnings, and after the National Weather Service sent another emergency alert regarding the “life-threatening” flash flood warning. As of Monday, 36m people are under excessive heat warnings in the US, particularly in the south and western areas, ABC News reported. Phoenix, Arizona’s capital city, is expected to hit a high temperature of 116F on Monday, the Associated Press reported, as temperatures remained above 100F throughout the weekend and, dangerously, are not coming down much at night, giving little relief and straining power systems as residents try to stay cool. America’s fifth largest city, with 1.6 million people, is accustomed to a hot desert climate, but temperatures are rising due to global heating and urban development which has created a sprawling asphalt and concrete heat island that traps heat especially at night. Read the Guardian’s report on how Phoenix residents suffered intolerable night-time temperatures during its first extreme heatwave of the season in June 2022. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. A heat advisory is expected to last through Tuesday, with heat index readings reaching as high as 120F last week and evening temperatures in the 80s offering little reprieve. The city of New Orleans announced that cooling centers will be open for residents to escape the heat throughout the weekend. Louisiana’s high humidity makes it even harder for the body to cool down during high temperatures, said Alicia Van Doren, who helped write a recent report for the Louisiana department of health about heat-related illnesses in the state. High humidity levels in the air prevent sweat from evaporating, impeding the body’s mechanism to stay cool. Van Doren said: So when that internal heat production exceeds the heat loss, the body reaches a point that it can no longer sustain its natural thermal regulation. That’s when core temps start to rise and heat stroke occurs. Since 1 April, more than 1,200 people have gone to emergency departments in the state for heat-related illnesses, according to Louisiana department of health, or LDH, data. A report published by the LDH last month found that workers – especially those in agriculture, construction, landscaping, transportation and utilities – are among the most at-risk populations for heat-related illnesses because they have less control over the amount of time they spend under the sun. About 320 workers are taken to the hospital for heat-related illnesses in the state every year, according to the report. Black workers were hospitalized for heat-related illness at double the rate of white workers. Good morning. Welcome back to our coverage of the extreme weather impacting tens of millions across the US. Excessive heat warnings remain in place in many areas across the country and are expected to last through the week. A heat dome of high pressure has been hovering over Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma creating dangerously hot weather for nearly two weeks. On Sunday, heat index values threatened to hit 110F in New Orleans, according to the National Weather Service. In Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures are expected to rise above 110F all week, after reaching 115F on Sunday – eight degrees above normal for this time of the year and approaching the record of 118F set in 2011. The onset of night will offer little relief from the sweltering heat, with night-time temperatures not expected to fall below the 80F necessary for the body to recover from the cumulative impact of heat. The current heatwave was made five times more likely by climate change, according to an analysis by Climate Central. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of residents in central Illinois remain without power after severe storms knocked down trees and power lines across the region. Heavy rains flooded Chicago on Sunday, trapping cars and flooding basements across the city. The National Weather Service warned the flooding could be “life-threatening”. Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates from across the region."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-10T10:56:31Z","webTitle":"Winter power cuts in UK unlikely, says National Grid boss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/10/winter-power-cuts-in-uk-less-likely-says-national-grid-boss","fields":{"bodyText":"National Grid expects there to be “sufficient generation” to avoid rolling power cuts this winter, with Britain’s supplies boosted by the return of a crucial electricity link to France that was hit by fire. The power networks owner said last month that Britain should be able to meet its energy needs this winter but could experience rolling power cuts in a worst-case scenario if Russia cut off gas supplies into Europe. Its chief executive, John Pettigrew, said on Thursday that the outlook had not changed, and the mild weather so far this winter was a positive for the energy picture. “What we have seen is pretty mild weather, which has led the Europeans to probably put more gas into storage than they originally anticipated. My understanding is the storage in Europe now is pretty much full,” he said. Last year the Sellindge converter station in Kent was forced to shut down a high-voltage cable that brings electricity from France after a huge fire. Half of its 2,000 gigawatt (GW) capacity was knocked out by the fire. Pettigrew said 500 megawatts would be restored this month and the remaining 500MW in December. “So by the time we get to the peak of the winter, the full 2GW will be available from the French interconnector, which I’m delighted about,” he said. National Grid reported a 50% rise in operating profits to £2.24bn in the six months to 30 September, buoyed up by extra revenues from its acquisition of the network operator Western Power Distribution. Its earnings were also boosted by a “strong performance” in its New York and New England business, plus the insurance proceeds from the Sellindge fire. Pettigrew stressed that the company did not produce or sell energy and was not recording the windfall profits of some oil and gas producers. Rishi Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, are reportedly considering extending the windfall tax on those firms and curbing the revenues of electricity generators. Pettigrew said he understood Sunak and Hunt’s focus on tax and spending “to balance the UK plc books” but said: “What we need is a stable policy regime, a stable regulatory regime and a stable financial regime.” National Grid increased its investment target to £40bn by 2026, up from a previous goal of £30bn to £35bn. The firm said £29bn of this would be in “the decarbonisation of energy networks”. “Connecting renewables and decarbonisation is an absolute focus. That’s a huge investment programme, £1m an hour, every single hour of every single day, 365 days a year,” he said. “Connecting clean energy at scale and pace will bring down energy bills for customers and increase energy security.” Pettigrew said the “vast majority” of suppliers in the UK had now signed up to a scheme launched last week to incentivise households to shift their power usage outside peak times this winter. The Guardian reported last week that E.ON, EDF and the British Gas owner, Centrica, had said they planned to participate in the scheme, which was first piloted by Octopus Energy. “We’re really pleased with the take-up. It will continue to grow as we move through the winter,” Pettigrew said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-01T15:37:43Z","webTitle":"Sunak’s failing windfall tax enabling oil giants to avoid paying billions, say Labour and Lib Dems – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2023/aug/01/rishi-sunak-nuclear-north-sea-oil-uk-politics-live","fields":{"bodyText":"Here’s a roundup of the key developments from the day: A taskforce has been launched to ensure the UK has the right skills in the nuclear industry as part of government plans to drastically scale up nuclear capacity. The panel will work to ensure roles are filled in the rapidly expanding defence and civil nuclear sectors, the Ministry of Defence said. The government’s plan to triple Britain’s nuclear power generation capacity by 2050 badly lacks the strategy to actually achieve it, according to a report published on Monday. In the report, the science, innovation and technology committee backed the decision to look to nuclear power as a way to meet the UK’s electricity needs amid the race to net zero but ministers need to be clear on how they propose to get there in order to encourage investment, the committee said. Rishi Sunak has pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves as he revealed a new round of intensive North Sea drilling, which experts said could be catastrophic for the climate. Unveiling a plan to authorise more than 100 new North Sea licences on a visit to north-east Scotland, the prime minister also indicated he would approve drilling at the UK’s largest untapped reserves in the Rosebank field, which hold 500m barrels of oil. Opposition parties say the government is failing to act as oil companies continue to rake in massive profits, despite oil and gas prices coming down from last year’s highs. The Liberal Democrats are calling for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Climate activists have sprayed part of the Scottish parliament building red in a protest against the prime minister announcing plans for 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Protesters from the This Is Rigged pressure group sprayed the entrance red. A billionaire global investor has led international condemnation of the UK’s new oil rush, saying he would pull his major investment from the country if the prime minister pursued “clickbait” fossil fuel policies. A UK government minister has said he “cannot put a timeframe” on when the Home Office will open a controversial giant barge meant to house asylum seekers, which has been further delayed for checks. The initial plan had been to move people on to the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, from this week, with numbers due to rise over the coming months until the vessel held about 500 men. Jeremy Hunt oversaw the signing of a low-tax treaty with San Marino championed by a leading Tory donor, who with his companies has given more than £700,000 to the party and £30,000 to the chancellor. Maurizio Bragagni, a prominent businessman and diplomat for San Marino, was present in No 11 when a “double taxation” treaty between the UK and San Marino was signed in May. We’re closing this liveblog now. Thanks so much for joining us and for all the comments and emails. You can follow our liveblog on the Ukraine-Russia war here: A billionaire global investor has led international condemnation of the UK’s new oil rush, saying he would pull his major investment from the country if the prime minister pursued “clickbait” fossil fuel policies. The Australian mining entrepreneur Andrew Forrest, who also runs the Minderoo Foundation philanthropic organisation, threatened to move his investments out of the UK over Rishi Sunak’s swivel towards new oil and gas drilling. Forrest told Bloomberg News: I am a major investor here. If I see this country steering itself over a cliff backing fossil fuel, I am going to start pulling out. I will push my investments over to North America … I must invest where I know I have proper leadership, not leadership which is on a clickbait cycle. The prime minister’s announcement that more than 100 new oil and gas drilling licences would be granted for the North Sea in the autumn has sparked condemnation from climate scientists, energy experts and some within his own party. The push for oil and gas is in direct conflict with international experts including those at the International Energy Agency and the International Institute for Sustainable Development who say oil and gas exploration must stop if the world is to stay within safe limits of global heating and meet the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The return to fossil fuel drilling puts the UK at odds with a string of European countries including Ireland, Denmark and Spain, who have already announced bans on new oil and gas exploration in order to tackle climate breakdown. Michael Bloss, a Green MEP from Germany, said the UK had lost all credibility: The UK has lost its leadership on this issue. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that there must not be new fossil fuel exploration in order to try and keep [the goal of limiting heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels] alive. Read more from my colleagues Sandra Laville, Oliver Milman, Nina Lakhani and Ajit Niranjan here: Rishi Sunak suggested focus should be on the “values that are at stake” in the de-banking row rather than on individuals. The prime minister said his “primary concern” was the wider impact of the issue and how it affects other people when asked about the fallout following Nigel Farage’s claim that his Coutts account was unfairly shut down, PA news reports. He refused to be drawn when asked whether current NatWest chair, Sir Howard Davies, should consider his position, telling GB News: I think it’s good that Nigel Farage and Coutts are in dialogue resolving the issue there, but Nigel Farage also spoke about the broader issue of this impacting other people, and that’s my primary concern, because ultimately this isn’t about any one individual, this is about values. Values that are important to me and important to our country... Rather than the individuals, to focus on the values that are at stake. Values of freedom of expression and privacy. I believe in those values very strongly. People need to be able to have lawfully held views that we might not agree with, but they shouldn’t be denied financial services because of them. And they’re entitled for their financial affairs to be kept private. A publican who heckled Rishi Sunak criticised the prime minister’s “audacity” for visiting a London beer festival on the day of an alcohol duty increase. Rudi Keyser, who runs a pub in Wimbledon, told the PA news agency: The amount of breweries that have shut down in the last year has been phenomenal. Plus on August 1 today they are raising alcohol duty across the board significantly. And I run a pub as part of a big national chain and we’ve been bulk buying in the last two weeks to avoid the alcohol duty increase. And he has the audacity to come and pull a pint for PR. Keyser said the “draught relief” announced by the prime minister was “smoke and mirrors” and consumers would be hit with a rise in prices. He said: It’s robbing Peter to pay Paul. So across the board, it’s all going up. I can tell you from my side now in the trade, the consumer is going to see an increase. Chris Skidmore wrote a report “praising the government for its leadership on climate change”, the prime minister has said. Rishi Sunak’s comments came after the Tory former energy minister and chair of the UK’s net-zero review condemned his decision to give the green light to more oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, accusing him of being on the “wrong side of history”. Asked about Skidmore’s comments at the Great British beer festival in west London’s Olympia exhibition centre, Sunak told broadcasters: He also wrote a report praising the government for its leadership on climate change. Yesterday was about strengthening our energy security, the independent assessment says that even when you meet net zero in 2050, around a quarter of our energy needs will still come from oil and gas. Rishi Sunak said Bibby Stockholm, the barge for asylum seekers, was going through a series of checks before it can house people following a delay. The Guardian reported on Monday that the first people in Portland, Dorset, were due to be moved onboard the vessel on Wednesday but that seems to have been delayed further with the minister now unwilling to put a timeframe on the move. Speaking to broadcasters at the Great British beer festival in west London’s Olympia exhibition centre, the prime minister said: All migrant accommodation has to go through a series of checks and inspections to make sure it complies with regulation, that’s what’s happening in this case. But let’s take a step back, this is ultimately about fairness. I don’t think it’s fair that British taxpayers are forking out six million quid a day to house illegal migrants in hotels – I want to put an end to that. Climate activists have sprayed part of the Scottish parliament building red in a protest against the prime minister announcing plans for 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Protesters from the This Is Rigged pressure group sprayed the entrance red. The group said on Twitter: “(The Scottish Government’s) silence on new oil and gas is deafening. They must vocally oppose all new oil and gas, or they are complicit.” This Is Rigged said four of their activists were involved. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We were made aware of protesters at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh shortly after 1.40pm on Tuesday August 1. Officers are in attendance.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he understood people would be “frustrated” by hearing about the level of profits for energy companies, but recalled the introduction of a windfall tax on energy firms during his time as chancellor. He said: “We’re using that money to help pay for people’s energy bills.” As we reported earlier, opposition parties have said that the government was failing to act as oil companies continue to rake in massive profits even though oil and gas prices have come down from last year’s highs. BP on Tuesday reported it had made around $2.59bn (£2bn) in underlying replacement cost profit over the three months to the end of June. Sunak was speaking at the Great British beer festival at Olympia in London to highlight a shake-up of alcohol duty. He said the centrepiece of the alcohol duty reforms is “backing British pubs”. He said: Now that we’ve left the EU, we can ensure that the tax we pay for beer on draft in pubs is lower, less than the tax we pay for beer in the supermarket. But we’re also planning to simplify the system so that the lower the alcohol in the drink, the less tax you pay. He added “most people would agree with that as a common sense principle” and “there is something for everyone” in the overhaul. “We’re also growing the economy by cutting taxes for small producers so they can expand and employ more people.” Sunak was heckled as he toured the festival. He was pouring a pint of Black Dub stout at the stall of the Wensleydale brewery, which operates from his constituency, when an onlooker called out: “Prime Minister, oh the irony that you’re raising alcohol duty on the day that you’re pulling a pint,” PA reports. Another man shouted at the teetotal Tory leader, who is famously a fan of carbonated soft drinks: “Prime Minister, it’s not Coca Cola.” A new system taxing all alcohol based on its strength has seen taxes rise for some types of drink. An organisation representing British Muslims has called for a review into banking practices over concerns about the “arbitrary closure” of accounts. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has written to the prime minister, chancellor and others urging the protection of universal banking rights, irrespective of someone’s religious or cultural background or political views. PA reports that the group said “many law-abiding Muslim individuals and Muslim-led organisations” have been “gravely impacted by the arbitrary withdrawal of banking services” and argued that it had “become par for the course over the past decade” with no action taken to address it. Banks are facing the prospect of widespread reforms to account closures after the Nigel Farage de-banking row that last week led to the resignation of the NatWest chief executive, Dame Alison Rose. The MCB said British Muslims had been disproportionately affected by the issue of bank accounts being closed down for many years. The organisation also sent its letter to leaders of opposition parties as well as the permanent secretary to the Treasury. It stated: Your decisive intervention calling for change at the NatWest group, following the recent denial of banking services to Nigel Farage, is of note. For British Muslims and Muslim-led organisations however, the arbitrary withdrawal of banking services by different UK banks has become par for the course over the past decade. The practice has continued unhindered, with limited transparency into the relevant banking systems and decision-making processes, little to no recourse for those impacted and no action taken by successive governments to address any of the aforementioned. It added that “significant cause for concern” remains “that many British Muslims and Muslim-led organisations have somehow been determined to be a potential risk” despite a lack of “validated evidence of any criminal activity”. Zara Mohammed, the MCB secretary general, said: We urge for an impartial review that not only addresses the mechanisms behind bank account closures but also examines why British Muslims are disproportionately affected by this issue. Our affiliates are ready to share their experiences and recommendations to ensure fair treatment for all. We call for the protection of universal banking rights, irrespective of religious or cultural backgrounds and political views, ensuring equitable access to financial services for all. Boris Johnson may finally be out of political hot water, but plans to erect an outdoor swimming pool at his Oxfordshire home have been disrupted by a population of great crested newts. Since leaving frontline politics, the former prime minister has been keen to press ahead with improvements to the home he purchased in May and has been living in with his wife, Carrie, and their three children. However, it seems that the great crested newt, against which Johnson railed when he was in No 10 and accused of being “a massive drag on the prosperity of this country”, has had its revenge. The UK’s largest newt, which takes its name from the striking jagged crest that males display in the spring breeding season, is a protected species under British law. As such, an unlimited fine and up to six months in prison could await anyone found guilty of disturbing the newt’s resting places and breeding sites, or taking their eggs. Johnson launched an application with South Oxfordshire district council in June for the construction of an outdoor pool, measuring 11 metres by 4 metres (36ft x 13ft). But Edward Church, a local government ecologist who reviewed the application, did not recommend granting permission for the pool to be built because there are great crested newts living in the grounds.

BP on Tuesday reported net profits of $2.6bn (£2bn) for the three months to the end of June. Despite it being more than two-thirds lower than last year’s results, it sparked further criticism of how the government has handled an industry which has benefited significantly from Vladimir Putin’s full-scale war on Ukraine and the spike in world energy prices that followed, PA Media reports. Ed Miliband said: These figures demonstrate the continuing scandal of the Tory failure to act on the windfalls of war being pocketed by the oil and gas producers. The shadow climate and net zero secretary added that Rishi Sunak “should start by fixing the gaping loopholes in the windfall tax on oil and gas profits, not handing them out billions of taxpayer subsidy. Labour would bring in a proper windfall tax on oil and gas giants to help tackle the cost-of-living crisis, alongside our plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower so we can lower bills for families and businesses. The government has put a windfall tax on the profits that oil and gas companies make from the North Sea. However, it has included the ability to reduce the tax if the companies invest, something the opposition has called a “loophole”. The Lib Dems earlier called for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies despite the recent fall in energy prices. In a statement, Sarah Olney, the party’s Treasury spokesperson, said: The government shouldn’t be hoodwinked to remove the windfall tax by this profit drop. Let’s be frank, these are still huge. No family should go cold next winter because the government backed down on taxing the likes of BP. It is time to put the needs of struggling families and pensioners over the wallets of global oil firms. A year ago BP made $8.5bn in profits, when it was boosted by a surge in oil and gas prices. BP blamed the decline in profits on planned maintenance work and lower margins in its refining business. The industry has also faced a gradual reduction in the price of fossil fuels, especially natural gas. Yet it still revealed plans to hand more cash to investors through higher dividends and a further share buyback. It comes a week after rival oil major Shell also delivered weaker-than-expected profits for its latest quarter. Jeremy Hunt oversaw the signing of a low-tax treaty with San Marino championed by a leading Tory donor, who with his companies has given more than £700,000 to the party and £30,000 to the chancellor. Maurizio Bragagni, a prominent businessman and diplomat for San Marino, was present in No 11 when a “double taxation” treaty between the UK and San Marino was signed in May. After the event, Hunt took time out to pose for photographs outside No 11 Downing Street with Bragagni and San Marino’s foreign secretary. Whitehall sources said San Marino had for at least two years been lobbying the government through the Foreign Office to negotiate and sign such a treaty but that the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs make the decision on which countries to prioritise. A Treasury spokesperson said Hunt had no involvement in the negotiation of the treaty, which was done by HMRC officials, and that the original request for a deal was made by the Foreign Office in 2022 – six months before he became chancellor. They said the process in the Treasury was led by Victoria Atkins, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who signed the document with Bragagni inside No 11. When the tax treaty was signed, the consulate praised the work of the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on San Marino, comprising MPs and peers, for its “continuous lobbying support” in relation to the UK government on the issue. Hunt is a former member of the APPG on San Marino and visited the small landlocked state surrounded by Italy in 2021, declaring hospitality from San Marino for four members of his family and himself, flights, accommodation and food with a total value of £7,869 over three days. Bragagni was present on the 2021 visit, during which Hunt was awarded an honour by San Marino known as the order of the Knights of St Agatha. At the time, San Marino said it had recognised “Grand Officer” Jeremy Hunt for his “merits in promoting San Marino’s best interests in the UK, for his valuable support during the emergency situation created in the Republic during the pandemic”. Here’s more from my colleagues Rowena Mason and Henry Dyer here: The average number of migrants crossing the Channel per boat last month was the highest on record, figures show. About 3,299 people made the journey in July in 63 boats – an average of about 52 per vessel. This is the highest average since records began in 2018, according to PA news agency analysis of government data. The third highest average – 47 – was reached in October last year when 147 boats carried 6,900 people in a month. Provisional Home Office figures show 14,732 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year. But no arrivals have been recorded in nearly a week amid poor weather conditions at sea. The 2023 total to date is 10% lower than the 16,434 recorded from January to July last year. The figures come as plans to move asylum seekers on to a giant barge on the Dorset coast have been beset by delays. Facing questions on Sky News, transport minister Richard Holden said he “can’t put a timeframe” on when migrants will board the Bibby Stockholm in Portland. The Home Office was reportedly due to send the first group of people to the accommodation on Tuesday, but the date was pushed back to Wednesday to give more time for final inspections amid concerns about fire safety. Downing Street said final preparations were under way this week. Meanwhile, media reports cited sources warning Border Force is braced for a surge in Channel crossings in August amid fears that beach patrols could be scaled back while French police officers take time off work. But the French government has assured the Home Office that patrols funded by the UK government under a multimillion-pound deal earlier this year will not be affected, the Times reports. Keir Starmer should hold his nerve on the Lords reform or we’ll never see the back of Boris Johnson’s cronies, writes Frances Ryan in this opinion piece. Bad news for fans of unelected legislatures: Labour is considering abolishing hereditary peers. According to the Sunday Times, Keir Starmer is drawing up plans that could see the immediate removal of hereditary peers if the party is elected, as part of a package of “interim” reforms to modernise and reduce the size of the House of Lords. Other moves being explored include introducing a mandatory retirement age or stopping hereditary peer byelections (so the current peers can’t be replaced after they leave). For the section of the British press who feel terror at the prospect of a Labour government, discussions of Lords “reform” is essentially one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Rather than fire and brimstone, the warning signs are questioning hereditary peers, ending private school tax breaks, decent public services and tackling child poverty (well, maybe not that last one quite yet). Despite decades of debate, the Labour party’s previous attempts to quash the Lords have never been fully successful. In 1999, Tony Blair’s government managed to end the 700-year-old right for all peers to sit and vote. This got the number of hereditary peers down from 750 but political pressure meant 92 remained, like a particularly stubborn mildew. And yet it feels like the tide may be turning. Last week, Boris Johnson’s former aides, Charlotte Owen and Ross Kempsell, were sworn in as life peers to widespread criticism, even among their own party. Few moments highlight the need for Lords reform better than the sight of people with barely a decade of work experience making laws for the next 60 years, and for no other reason than it was the whim of a man who nicknamed himself “Big Dog”. Read the full piece here: The Liberal Democrats are calling for the government to keep the windfall tax on oil and gas companies despite the recent fall in energy prices after BP reported £2bn in net profit for the second quarter of the year. BP has reported net profits of $2.6bn (£2bn) for the three months to the end of June as the climate crisis triggers extreme heatwaves, angering climate campaigners. The company blamed falling oil and gas markets for the drop in profits from $8.5bn in the same period last year when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ignited a rise in global energy markets. BP will increase its shareholder dividends by 10% to $2.3bn, despite the fall in profits. It will also return a further $1.5bn to investors through a share buyback over the next three months. The Lib Dems say the “monster profits” will be a “nasty shock to families who couldn’t afford to heat their homes this year”. In a statement, Sarah Olney, the party’s Treasury spokesperson, said: The government shouldn’t be hoodwinked to remove the windfall tax by this profit drop. Let’s be frank, these are still huge. No family should go cold next winter because the government backed down on taxing the likes of BP. It is time to put the needs of struggling families and pensioners over the wallets of global oil firms. The prime minister’s press secretary was asked if there would be a review of the windfall tax yesterday but she wouldn’t comment “specifically on tax, particularly ahead of a fiscal event”. More broadly, she told reporters: What the windfall tax has done has raised over £6bn since it was introduced, which has helped to fund consumer help with their energy bills of on average about £3,300 per household. That remains the policy and I don’t have anything more to add on the future of that. Global oil and gas market prices have tumbled since reaching a peak last year. The global oil price averaged $76.60 a barrel in the last quarter, down sharply from an average of about $112 a barrel in the second quarter of last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Nigel Farage has said that the newly installed boss of Coutts has offered to keep his accounts there open, reversing a decision that triggered a scandal and the resignation of the private bank’s previous chief executive. The former Ukip leader said he welcomed the offer but was still taking legal action against NatWest, which owns Coutts, demanding compensation, a full apology and a face-to-face meeting with the banking group’s bosses. Peter Flavel resigned as Coutts chief executive last Thursday, less than two days after the NatWest boss, Alison Rose, also stepped down over her role in the row. Flavel has been replaced by Mohammed Syed. “The new CEO of Coutts … has written to me to say I can keep both my personal and my business accounts, and that’s good, and I thank him for it,” Farage said on GB News on Monday night. But enormous harm has been done to me over the course of the last few months … It has taken up a huge amount of my time and it has cost me, so far, quite a lot of money in legal fees. So I have today sent a legal litigation letter to Coutts, where I want some full apologies, I want some compensation for my cost. “But more important than all of that, I want a face-to-face meeting with the bank’s bosses. I want to find out how many other people in Coutts or NatWest have had accounts closed because of their political opinions. And I want to make sure this never happens to anybody else ever again. Farage obtained documents from Coutts showing that while he had been below the bank’s “commercial criteria” for some time – referring to its requirement to hold £1m in investments or loans, or £3m in savings – the decision to shut his accounts was also based on concerns that his “xenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views” posed a risk to its reputation. Banks are not allowed to shut accounts or deny services because of customers’ political views or beliefs. Farage did not clarify whether he had accepted Coutts’s offer to keep his account open. NatWest Group said it could not comment on individual customers. A UK government minister has said he “cannot put a timeframe” on when the Home Office will open a controversial giant barge meant to house asylum seekers, which has been further delayed for checks. The initial plan had been to move people on to the Bibby Stockholm in Portland, Dorset, from this week, with numbers due to rise over the coming months until the vessel held about 500 men. Asked on Sky News when the barge would be available, the transport minister Richard Holden said: It’s going through its final checks at the moment. It’s right that … whatever accommodation we provide is safe and secure as well. I can’t put a timeframe on it. Asked if safety concerns were delaying the opening, he said: It’s going through final checks at the moment. With anything you would want them to be properly checked out. The Guardian reported on Monday that the first asylum seekers were due to be moved onboard the vessel on Wednesday but that seems to have been delayed further with the minister now unwilling to put a timeframe on the move. Asked if it would be delayed as long as the Rwanda policy had taken to implement, Holden added: I can’t comment on the ongoing process of checks and things that have to take place but it is my understanding (it is) in its final checks. Fears had been expressed that the barge could become a “floating Grenfell” and endanger the lives of vulnerable people who have fled hardship and war as it has not received the relevant safety signoff. About 40 claimants staying in other Home Office accommodation had received transfer letters saying they would be moved to the 222-cabin vessel in Dorset, Whitehall sources said. More than 50 national organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Asylum Matters and Refugee Action, have called the government’s plan “cruel and inhumane”. They said the vessel was “entirely inappropriate” and would house traumatised migrants in “detention-like conditions”. Read more here: Rishi Sunak has pledged to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves as he revealed a new round of intensive North Sea drilling, which experts said could be catastrophic for the climate. Unveiling a plan to authorise more than 100 new North Sea licences on a visit to north-east Scotland, the prime minister also indicated he would approve drilling at the UK’s largest untapped reserves in the Rosebank field, which hold 500m barrels of oil. Speaking to reporters on a visit to a Shell gas terminal north of Aberdeen, Sunak insisted the plan was compatible with net zero commitments given the anticipated part-reliance on fossil fuels for years to come, saying it was more carbon-intensive to ship oil and gas from other countries. But experts said this ignored the fact that much of the UK’s imported gas comes by pipeline and tends to be produced more cleanly than its British equivalent. Environmental groups said Sunak’s plan would “send a wrecking ball” through climate commitments. Tory and Labour MPs said Sunak’s “economically illiterate” announcement was “driving a coach and horses” through previous promises, and warned the prime minister he was “on the wrong side of history” and that modern voters wanted leaders who “protect, and not threaten, our environment”. While the new round of licences has been in progress for many weeks, Sunak’s visit highlights the shift towards greater scepticism over green policies since the Conservatives narrowly won the Uxbridge byelection, thanks in part to concern about London’s soon-to-be-expanded ultra-low emission zone. The new round of licences will permit drilling closer to existing projects than previously allowed, something Sunak’s press secretary said was intended to maximise the amount that could be extracted. While Sunak has insisted he remains committed to the UK’s target to reach net zero by 2050 and other green targets, his new approach has prompted concern among some Tory MPs, who worry the party could suffer among young voters and those tempted by the Liberal Democrats. Read the full story from my colleagues Severin Carrell, Peter Walker and Helena Horton here: The government’s plan to triple Britain’s nuclear power generation capacity by 2050 badly lacks the strategy to actually achieve it, according to a report published on Monday. In the report, the science, innovation and technology committee backed the decision to look to nuclear power as a way to meet the UK’s electricity needs amid the race to net zero but ministers need to be clear on how they propose to get there in order to encourage investment, the committee said. It warned that the government’s own most recent energy security plan, published in March, offers little clue about how measures will be implemented. The committee chair, Greg Clark, noted that the “stretching” ambitions to achieve 24GW of nuclear power by 2050 would be almost double the highest level of nuclear generation the UK has ever attained. He said: The only way to achieve this is to translate these very high-level aspirations into a comprehensive, concrete and detailed nuclear strategic plan which is developed jointly with the nuclear industry, which enjoys long-term cross-party political commitment and which therefore offers dependability for private and public investment decisions. A taskforce has been launched to ensure the UK has the right skills in the nuclear industry as part of government plans to drastically scale up nuclear capacity. The panel will work to ensure roles are filled in the rapidly expanding defence and civil nuclear sectors, the Ministry of Defence said. It will develop a national skills strategy for jobs across the industry, from technical scientific and engineering roles to logistics, project management, commercial and finance, PA Media reports. The taskforce will be chaired by Sir Simon Bollom, the former chief executive of Defence Equipment and Support, and include government officials, academics and industry partners. The defence procurement minister, James Cartlidge, said: By developing nuclear skills, we are not just investing in the UK economy but our national security. The creation of this new taskforce will challenge the whole of the UK’s nuclear sector to be ambitious in addressing the nuclear skills gap, and we are delighted to appoint Sir Simon Bollom to drive this work forward. Bollom said: The nuclear sector is vital to our nation, and I am proud to have been given the opportunity to lead such an important taskforce to ensure that we have the people and skills we need to deliver our programmes. The nuclear minister, Andrew Bowie, hailed a nuclear “revival” with the launch of Great British Nuclear, an arm’s-length body involved in the government-backed competition to develop smaller-scale nuclear technology projects.

The administration will also retire a gravity bomb, the B83-1, from its arsenal as part of its Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), but arms control advocates argued the changes from the Trump era did not go far enough. The administration is retaining another weapon variant introduced by Trump, a low-yield warhead called the W76-2, intended to deter an adversary like Russia using a low-yield weapon. The Democratic party manifesto in 2020 had called the W76-2 “unnecessary, wasteful, and indefensible”. The Biden NPR said that the “fundamental role of nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners”. That declaratory policy stops sort of saying deterring nuclear attack is the sole purpose of the arsenal, which is what Biden promised in his election campaign. Instead, the NPR says that the US could strike back against “a narrow range of other high consequence, strategic-level attacks”. Jon Wolfsthal, who was special assistant to Barack Obama on arms control and nonproliferation issues, expressed disappointment in the Biden NPR. “The world is a dangerous place and our allies and we still rely on nuclear deterrence but this document ignores the role the US can play to make nukes less usable, less likely,” Wolfsthal said on Twitter. The policy document points to arms control agreements as offering “the most effective, durable and responsible path to achieving a key goal: reducing the role of nuclear weapons in US strategy.” It undertakes to uphold the last remaining arms control agreement with Russia, the New Start treaty, and negotiate a successor agreement when it expires in 2026, but it adds: “negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith”. The NPR points out that as well as strategic weapons subject to the limits of New Start, Russia has an active stockpile of up to 2,000 non-strategic, or tactical, warheads, of the sort Vladimir Putin and his officials have hinted could be used against Ukraine. The US only has a few hundred tactical weapons. “Similarly, Russia is pursuing several novel nuclear-capable systems designed to hold the US homeland or allies and partners at risk, some of which are also not accountable under New Start,” the NPR said. The document repeats an earlier US estimate that China will have 1,000 deliverable warheads by the end of the decade, so that by the 2030s the US “will, for the first time in its history, face two major nuclear powers as strategic competitors and potential adversaries.” Introducing the National Defence Strategy, in which the NPR is a part, the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, described China as America’s “pacing challenge” while Russia was an “immediate and sharp threat” which “could not systemically challenge the US over the long term”. The NPR leaves open the possibility that the US might have to increase its arsenal as a result of the dual threat from China and Russia, saying that “as the security environment evolves, it may be necessary to consider nuclear strategy and force adjustments to assure our ability to achieve deterrence.” In response to the NPR, Jessica Sleight, partner for policy at Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group, said: “Contrary to President Biden’s stated intentions to reduce the role of nuclear weapons, this Nuclear Posture Review continues decades of nuclear overkill, doubles down on needless weapons programs, and fails to advance overdue reforms to policy and posture that would make the United States, its allies, and the world safer.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"World Bank announces additional $4.5bn in Ukraine aid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","fields":{"bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: The United States will provide an additional $4.5 billion (£3.7 bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5 billion (£7 bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3 billion (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for following along. The Pentagon has unveiled the latest billion dollar slice of US military aid to Ukraine. The main items are more ammunition for the 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) the US has sent, as well as new missiles for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), a thousand Javelin anti-tank missiles, and hundreds of Swedish made AT4 shoulder launched anti-tank systems. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, noted it was the 18th drawdown on US military stocks sent to Ukraine, making a total of $9.8bn in security assistance so far under the Biden administration. “This is the largest single drawdown of US arms and equipment utilizing this authority to date,” Kahl said. “The package provides a significant amount of additional ammunition, weapons and equipment, the types of which the Ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country.” Kahl said the rockets (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS) the US has been sending to Ukraine to fire from the Himars mobile launch vehicles, are “having a very profound effect”. “This is a 200 pound warhead. It’s kind of the equivalent of an airstrike, frankly, a precision guided airstrike,” he said. “These are GPS-guided munitions. They’ve been very effective in hitting things that previously the Ukrainians had difficulty hitting reliably - so command-and-control nodes, sustainment and logistics hubs, key radar systems and other things. And what it’s done is it’s made it more difficult for the Russians to move forces around the battlefield. “They’ve had to move certain assets back away from the Himars. It slowed them down. It’s made it harder for them to resupply other forces. So I think it’s having real operational effects.” He estimated Russian casualties as 70,000 to 80,000 dead and wounded. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Reuters reported: It follows previous transfers of $1.7bn in July and $1.3bn in June, USAid said. Washington has also provided billions of dollars in military support, and plans a new $1bn weapons package shortly. The U.S. funds are to help the Ukrainian government maintain essential functions, including social and financial assistance for the growing poor population, children with disabilities, and millions of internally displaced persons, as the war drags on. Ukrainian officials estimate the country faces a $5bn-a-month fiscal shortfall - or 2.5% of pre-war gross domestic product - due to the cost of the war and declining tax revenues. Economists say that will swell Ukraine’s annual deficit to 25% of GDP, compared with 3.5% before the conflict. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war and the large numbers of displaced persons, compared with 2.5% before the start of the war. Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The assertions could not be independently verified by Reuters and there was no immediate reaction to the Ukraine statement from Moscow or Russian state-run media. The suspects, one a resident of the eastern Luhansk region held by Russia-backed separatists and the other a resident of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, were promised up to $150,000 (£124,000) by Russian handlers for the murder of each of their targets, the SBU said. The man from Luhansk region entered Ukraine from Belarus and was detained in the city of Kovel in north-west Ukraine along with the Kyiv resident, the statement said. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitskyi, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” he said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Workers at the nuclear complex are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia complex, adding that damage to the facility from Russian attacks means any radiation could not be detected. Tsymbaliuk spoke in Vienna as international alarm over artillery attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant grew, with Kyiv warning of the risk of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe and appealing for the area to be made a demilitarised zone, Reuters reported. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Reuters reported that she went on to say: “They are taking the whole of Europe hostage and are not against setting fire to it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” Ukraine’s atomic energy agency Energoatom is quoting Dmytro Lubinets, the country’s human rights ombudsman, on its official Telegram channel. It says: The Russian Federation continues acts of nuclear terrorism in relation to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) facilities and its personnel. According to the information of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is currently mined, and individual employees of the station are subject to torture and enforced disappearance, and they receive threats. This poses a threat to the lives of employees and prevents the normal operation of the facility. As the commissioner for human rights of the parliament of Ukraine, I first of all declare the flagrant threat posed by the presence of the Russian military in Zaporizhzhia NPP not only for tens of millions of Ukrainians, but also for the whole world. The destructive consequences of nuclear terrorism and the spread of radioactivity do not ‘respect’ state borders, and radioactive emissions spread uncontrollably, the consequences of radioactive pollution remain for decades. Once again, I call on the secretary general of the UN, the IAEA and the entire world community to take all possible measures to send a security mission to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, to completely demilitarise the territory of the NPP, and to provide security guarantees to the employees of the nuclear plant and residents of the city. Reuters is carrying an opposing line from the Russian side. It quotes Russia’s foreign ministry as saying western nations are unwilling to point the finger of blame for the alleged shelling of the plant at Ukrainian forces, and that while Russia sees the IAEA’s request to inspect Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv has an interest in not allowing the inspection to take place. Ukraine has previously objected to the idea that the IAEA would visit Zaporizhzhia, as they fear it would lend legitimacy and normalise Russia’s occupation of the facility and the territory that surrounds it. For their part, if Ukraine’s claims that staff are being mistreated there are true, then Russia also has a vested interest in avoiding an inspection that might reveal this. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, as part of a visit that will also take him to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. “If we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world,” Blinken said. Reuters reported that Blinken said the US felt it was important to stand up to Russia because its aggression against Ukraine threatened the foundational principles of the international system. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. South Africa abstained from a United Nations vote denouncing the invasion of Ukraine, and like other African countries has resisted calls to condemn Russia. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has had harsh words on Telegram this afternoon following news that pro-Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia are moving towards holding a referendum to join the Russian Federation. Fedorov, who was forced into exile early in the war, writes: The collaborators decided to make another propaganda picture for the Russian mass media. They brought a crowd from other temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region to Melitopol – 700 people, because even that many cannot be recruited among the local population – and held a ‘forum’ in the city’s palace of culture. Yevhen Balytskyi, the Gauleiter of the Zaporizhzhia region, who at one time failed miserably in the local elections, gaining less than 10%, conducted the coven. It is difficult to guess what plans will appear in the head of this mentally ill local tsar and Kremlin henchman of tomorrow. In any case, his ‘orders’ have no legal significance. The RIA Novosti news agency reported earlier that Balytskyi signed the order for a referendum at a forum entitled “We are together with Russia”. It quotes Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the regional administration imposed by pro-Russian secessionists saying on the radio: We are preparing 100 percent. Everything is working out. We will have a voting format that is quite understandable to people. We will not conduct any experiments. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail on Monday after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multistorey apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Reuters reports the court in Chernihiv, north-east Ukraine, found Mikhail Kulikov, guilty of hitting the residential building on 26 February, two days after Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine began. Kulikov, who was capture while fighting, pleaded guilty and sought a more lenient punishment because he said he had been following orders, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. The residential block was not a military target or being used for military purposes, it said. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces deliberately target civilians. This is Martin Belam picking up the live blog again for an hour. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia is ready to facilitate a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Moscow’s permanent representative to the nuclear watchdog as saying on Monday. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in recent days, Reuters reported. Natalia Kompaniets spends her days running over a dilemma with her daughter as they sit in their temporary new home, a simply furnished room on the first floor of an unmarked building, in a nondescript suburb of Budapest. “Every day we think, should we go back or not? There’s a battle in our souls,” said Kompaniets, a 51-year-old who left the town of Obukhiv outside Kyiv in early March along with her daughter and young granddaughter. Here, as well as elsewhere in Hungary, Poland and other countries neighbouring Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees – mostly women, children and elderly people – are weighing up similar questions. If they are from a relatively safe part of Ukraine, is it time to return? Should they wait for the war to end? And how long would that mean waiting? Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling its Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, the Ukrainian ambassador to the global nuclear watchdog has said, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. “We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,” Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, the ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna. “We really need it urgently, as soon as possible, I would say not later than the end of this month,” he added. Ukraine has received its first three German Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The air defence systems, which are operated by three-person crews and can hit targets at up to two and half miles, are one of various pieces of western military kit being supplied to Ukraine to help it fend off the Russian invasion, Reuters reported. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia, the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Monday. It comes as Russia’s defence ministry said that Ukraine had shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe, on 7 August, damaging high-voltage power lines and forcing the plant to reduce its output. In its daily military briefing, the defence ministry said Ukraine had shelled the power station at around 12.40pm (9.40am GMT) from positions near the town of Marhanets, Reuters reported. The shelling damaged a high-voltage power line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions – parts of which are under Russian control – in southern Ukraine, the ministry said. A power surge also occurred as a result of the shelling, Moscow said, triggering a safety system that cut off the power supply, it added. German chancellor Olaf Scholz does not consider support for Russia sanctions to be waning even with energy bills expected to surge further, a government spokesperson said on Monday. “We face difficult months ahead,” the spokesperson said, adding: “But it is clear that we stand firmly on the side of Ukraine and we stand behind the sanctions that we agreed together with the European Union and the international community”. Speaking at a regular news conference in Berlin, the spokesperson also ruled out approval for the shelved Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces shot down 19 US-made Himars missiles across eastern and southern Ukraine, and destroyed Himars vehicles near the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk. Reuters was unable to verify the reports. More on this claim as it comes. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. In response to a question about Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan’s offers to broker peace talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy could meet only after negotiators from both sides had “done their homework”. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reported. “The Ukrainian delegation has gone off the radar, there is no negotiation process now,” Peskov said on Monday. “As for a meeting between presidents Putin and Zelenskiy, it is possible only after all the homework has been done by the delegations. This is missing, so there are no necessary prerequisites for the meeting,” he added. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax: “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called this morning for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Reuters reports he made the comments on television after Ukraine and Russia accused each of shelling the nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – which lies in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. At the same time, Energoatom has posted on its official Telegram channel accusing Russia of mining the plant. It claims to be quoting “the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence forces of the Russian Federation, major general Valeriy Vasyliev”, accusing him of saying: “We have planted mines in all the important facilities of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the plant will be either Russian – or no one’s.” AFP reports Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. “By 4 August, those fleeing Ukraine due to the Russian military attack had submitted 35,074 applications for temporary protection,” the Finnish immigration service said in a statement. More than 37,000 people are currently registered in the reception system, “which is more than ever before”. “One third of those fleeing Ukraine are children,” the immigration service said. The latest figures from UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. Reuters reports he told Interfax: “We have information from the military and representatives of Russia’s Rosatom, who are here, just watching the situation. We have information from them that everything is operating in normal mode.” Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight, Ukrainian officials have said. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” Reuters reports she said on television. The claims have not been independently verified, but earlier Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency that the Antonivskyi bridge had been struck again. Here is a selection of images that have been sent to us today over the newswires from Sloviansk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, appears to have confirmed on Telegram that at least one person has been killed in a strike this morning, posting “Unfortunately, as a result of the morning shelling, one person died, another one was injured. Information is being updated. Emergency medical personnel are on site.” In the last few minutes the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov has posted to Telegram to say: Now Pavlovo Pole is being shelled already in the morning … minutes ago there was an explosion. There is definitely no military infrastructure in this peaceful and densely populated area. I ask everyone to be in shelters – the shelling can be repeated. Here is an image that has been sent to us from Turkey of the ship Polarnet arriving at Derince port. It is carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that two people were killed in shelling on the region in the last 24 hours. He claimed that overnight the roof of the administrative building in Kharkiv’s Kyiv district had caught fire due to the shelling. His message ended: As you can see, the Russians, because of their lack of success at the front, are striking peaceful towns and villages in the region. But we are stronger than their pathetic attempts to intimidate us. Victory is ours! In the last few minutes he has issued a broad warning to citizens in Kharkiv, posting to Telegram to say: “Residents of Kharkiv and the region, stay in shelters as much as possible. The Russian occupiers strike Kharkiv. Do not leave safe places.” In his daily status update, Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has cautioned residents about the information sources they use, saying overnight rumours had been spread about a failure of the air alert system. He wrote on Telegram: On 8 August, at 2.57am, one of the Telegram channels spread information that there was an air alert in Lviv, but due to technical reasons, the city and phone applications did not turn on the notification. This information is not true! There was no threat. Follow and trust only official sources of information. The claim has not been independently verified. Elsewhere in his daily update, Kozytskyi said there had been one genuine air alert overnight, but that “the danger did not materialise”, and that 270 people arrived in his region on two evacuation trains from the east of the country. Seven hundred and 68 people departed from the Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on four trains. My colleague Shaun Walker recently wrote a lengthy profile of Dmitry Medvedev on the former Russian leader’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk. Medvedev has given an interview to Tass, which it has published this morning, which contains plenty of Medvedev’s anti-western rhetoric. The interview is timed to coincide with the anniversary of Russia’s assault on Georgia in 2008. which took place when he was in power. In today’s interview, Medvedev says: The criminal policy of the United States is being aggressively pursued in Ukraine. True, with much more active support from the European Union, which has finally lost its independence. The goal is the same – to destroy Russia. This is the root cause of the extremely aggressive, Russophobic geopolitical process initiated by the west. Our answer is tough, but carefully thought out. If there is an opportunity to resolve the problem peacefully, at the negotiating table, this should be done. But when there is no way out, you have to react by force. Unfortunately, both in Georgia and Ukraine, the authorities of these countries left Russia no choice, disrupting the processes of political settlement of these conflicts. And we deliberately went for military intervention. As far as Nato is concerned, its relentless desire to expand along Russia’s borders, like a cancerous tumour, has become a global problem. It makes all reasonable people sick. You can read the full Medvedev interview with Tass here. Read Shaun Walker’s profile of Medvedev here: ‘I hate them’: Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, an entity recognised as legitimate and official by only three UN member states, has issued a briefing for the day in which they say in the last 24 hours they have killed “up to 53 personnel” from Ukrainian forces, and destroyed four armoured personnel carriers and “seven units of special vehicles”. The announcement on Telegram also claims that as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces on the city of Alchevsk in occupied Luhansk, one civilian was killed and 19 people were injured, including five children. They claim that 13 apartment buildings, four kindergartens and a school were damaged. They claim that “peaceful life is being restored in the territories of the Luhansk People’s Republic liberated from Ukrainian nationalists” and cite more than five hectares being cleared of explosive devices. They also claim to be delivering humanitarian aid. None of the claims have been independently verified. A key Russian-held bridge into the occupied southern city of Kherson has been hit again overnight by Ukrainian forces, according to reports from the Russian-imposed administration there. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency: The blow was struck on the Antonivskiy bridge. The equipment of the builders who are repairing the bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted the bridge with high-precision weapons as it is one of only two permanent re-supply routes over the Dnieper River, linking the occupied city with the rest of Kherson region and down to annexed Crimea in the south. The claims have not been independently verified. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has posted to Telegram overnight about the situation in the occupied city, which he is in exile from. He told his supporters on Telegram: Today, high-precision Himars missiles fired at the points of temporary deployment of the occupying forces at industrial sites in various districts of the city of Melitopol. Last week, the occupiers redeployed a significant part of air defence from Melitopol to Kherson. Tonight is the most effective and shows that the existing enemy air defence units are no longer able to resist Himars. The weakening of the air defence system creates the necessary prerequisites for a successful counteroffensive in the direction of Melitopol. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Two more grain carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports, Reuters reports. The Sacura, which departed from Yuzni, is carrying 11,000 tonnes of soybeans to Italy, while the Arizona, which left Chernomorsk, is carrying 48,458 tonnes of corn to Iskenderun in southern Turkey. It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines, also known as “butterfly mines”, have the potential to inflict widespread casualties amongst both the military and the local civilian population. The ministry calls the PFM-1 mines “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons”, pointing to the devastating impact the mines had in the Soviet-Afghan war where they allegedly maimed a number of children who mistook them for toys. Battle for Donbas Russian forces are trying to gain full control of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region as it stepped up attacks north and north-west of Donetsk city on Sunday, Reuters reports The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, according to Ukraine’s military. In addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson. Hello, it’s Jordyn Beazley back with you on the Guardian’s live blog as we cover all the latest developments from Ukraine. UN secretary general António Guterres has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Here’s a summary of the main points you might have missed: Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military.

But how dangerous is the situation and what is likely to happen next? Why is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant important? The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes. Situated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, south-west of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war. The presence of the water-cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called “sheltered” artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield” saying: “Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.” That has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks. Why is there renewed concern? There are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict. A second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility. According to Energoatom – the Ukrainian nuclear authority – the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site. However, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia – so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend’s incident was in and of itself. While Ukraine’s objective – to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area – is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity. A final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence – reported in Ukrainian media outlets – that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: “There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.” However, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between “nuclear blackmail” and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself. So how dangerous is shelling around the plant? The reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact – think of a civilian airliner crashing into them – protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic. The buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited. The reality is that the situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T17:18:46Z","webTitle":"‘Rampant profiteering’: Unite asks Ofgem to cap power distributors’ profits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/20/unite-union-rampant-profiteering-ofgem-cap-power-distributors-profits-sharon-graham","fields":{"bodyText":"The companies responsible for bringing electricity to UK homes have been accused of “rampant profiteering” by a leading union that is calling for the energy regulator to cap their earnings. Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, has written to Ofgem to ask it to clamp down on “excessive” profits generated by regional electricity distribution network operators (DNOs), which raked in £15.8bn in profits last year and have paid out £3.6bn in dividends between 2017 and 2021. In the letter to Ofgem, which has been seen by the Guardian, Graham said the six operators have “been holding the public to ransom for too much and for too long” and called for a recent consultation on the amount they could charge energy suppliers, and ultimately consumers, to be reopened. Graham wants Ofgem, which has been condemned for its handling of the energy crisis, to revise its policies to tighten the controls on DNOs. “It is time to set a clear cap on profits to help give consumers confidence that their energy bills are fair and not simply a vehicle for profiteering energy network owners,” she said. Research by Common Wealth, a thinktank, shows that DNOs have higher profit margins than any other sector in the UK, and expects operators to register profit margins of more than 50% in 2022. The thinktank argues that consumers are paying for privatised monopolies to reward their investors. The government has curbed profits on North Sea oil and gas producers and introduced a levy on “excess returns” made by electricity generators including windfarms and nuclear power plants. However, the profits of DNOs – which carry the energy but do not sell it – have not been on the political agenda. Their earnings have not been inflated by high wholesale gas prices, but charges to consumers through network costs have been rising. Ofgem sets price controls on the monopolies’ revenues for five-year periods to ensure that companies run efficient networks and are incentivised to invest in improving them. In 2019, the regulator conceded that the cost to consumers of transmission were “higher than they needed to be” and that profit margins were “towards the higher end of our expectations”. Average households paid £214.35 for gas and electricity distribution in 2021, it said. The current network price controls period ends this April, with the next five-year period beginning after that. Ofgem is due to make its final determinations on the pricing on 30 November after a consultation with the industry, which began before the energy crisis. In her letter to Ofgem’s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, Graham asked for the regulator to reopen the consultation. As part of her call for an earnings cap, she cited the profits of UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes power to 8.3m homes and businesses across London, the east and south-east of England. Common Wealth analysis shows the company has made £2.4bn in profits over the past four years. The UK’s largest electricity distributor, which is owned by CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based holding company that also owns the port of Felixstowe, has paid out £1bn in dividends to shareholders over the same period. CK bought UKPN for £5.5bn in 2010 and a £15bn sale of the DNO to a consortium collapsed in the summer amid concerns over the price. In the past four years, Northern Powergrid, which has 3.9 million customers in north-east England and Yorkshire, made £1bn in profit, and Electricity North West made £323m, handing out £212m to shareholders. Northern Powergrid did not pay a dividend during the period, but did in 2015 (£100m) and in 2017 (£50m). In her letter, Graham said: “Ofgem is a regulator that doesn’t regulate. Time for that to change. How long must the public pay for profiteering from the likes of UK Power Networks? It’s time to pull the plug on the energy profiteers.” A spokesperson for UKPN said its cost to the customer was £98 on average, “one of the lowest of any UK electricity distributor and falling as a percentage of the overall electricity bill by a proposed 15% in real terms over the period 2023-28”. The company has invested £6.4bn over 11 years in networks, it said. Ofgem said: “We do not believe that it would be in consumers’ interests to delay the implementation of the price control.” A spokesperson for Energy Networks Association, which represents energy network operators, claimed that Unite’s figures were “misleading” and that investment returns were an accurate reflection of profitability. “The network companies are allowed, by Ofgem, to earn around 5% on their investments and the figures being suggested do not reflect the costs associated with these essential investments,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-15T14:11:39Z","webTitle":"Chinese congress expected to cement power of Xi Jinping","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/15/chinese-congress-expected-to-cement-power-of-xi-jinping","fields":{"bodyText":"The highest level meeting of China’s ruling Communist party this week is likely to include constitutional changes to further cement the power of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, party officials have confirmed. Xi is expected to regain his position as leader of the CCP and its military commission at the week-long conference, setting the stage for retaining the presidency next year, after abolishing term limits in 2018. The 20th party congress will begin on Sunday morning with a major speech by Xi, espousing the party’s achievements over the past five-year term, and outlining its plans for the next. Days of closed-door meetings and the formalisation of official reshuffles will follow, before the members of the all-powerful politburo standing committee are revealed next weekend. At a press conference in Beijing, the party spokesperson Sun Yeli told reporters revisions of the party’s governing constitution were on the agenda. Sun did not provide specifics but said amendments were necessary to enshrine new “major theoretical views and major strategic ideas” introduced during the congress. Amendments are widely expected to enshrine the “two establishes”, a party political term for new doctrines cementing Xi as the “core” of the CCP and his ideas as the party’s underpinning ideology. Sun said it had been common practice for the party to make amendments to its constitution to “recognise innovations in theory and revolutions in practice”. During a pre-vetted Q&amp;A session, Sun also indicated China’s increasingly contentious Covid policy of “dynamic zero” was to remain for now. He said as much as the world yearned for the pandemic to end, the reality was the virus still existed, and China’s government would continue to “put people and people’s lives front and centre” in its response. The dynamic zero covid policy – which has resulted in sudden lockdowns and movement restrictions being imposed on buildings, neighbourhoods, or entire cities – was “a science-based approach … with minimum costs for the society and in the shortest possible time”. He said this policy had “worked the best for our country”. In the press conference, one of the few public events of the congress, Sun sidestepped questions about China’s economic troubles and whether the era of “high-speed growth” had come to an end. He said it was “an important yardstick but not the only one”; China had entered a new era, away from high-speed growth and towards high-quality development. On US relations, Sun appeared to take a somewhat conciliatory tone. The two countries’ relationship has plummeted in recent years, with trade wars, diplomatic spats and the imposition of sanctions, as well as hostilities over China’s human rights abuses and crackdowns on Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and its growing aggression in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait. Sun said: “We take the view that China and the US have more common interests than differences. We don’t provoke, nor do we flinch from facing up to trouble.” However, he said “no one can hold back the historic force of China’s national rejuvenation”, a reference to Xi’s commitment to annexing Taiwan – a democracy which the CCP claims is a Chinese province and has sworn to “unify”. The CCP has repeatedly said it will use force to take Taiwan if necessary, most recently in a white paper released last month. Sun said force was a last resort to be taken “under compelling circumstances” and that peaceful unification was the CCP’s “first choice”. “We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and effort, and create vast space for peaceful reunification,” he said. “We don’t renounce the use of force … This is to guard against external interference and a small handful of Taiwan independence elements and their separatist moves. By no means does this target our fellow Chinese in Taiwan.” Senior Chinese officials have recently increased their rhetoric over Taiwan, warning of “re-education” of citizens post-invasion, and punishment for independence advocates. Consistent opinion polling in Taiwan shows a growing majority reject the prospect of Chinese rule."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T14:16:29Z","webTitle":"Conservatives will not devolve more powers to Scotland, Rishi Sunak says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/apr/28/conservatives-devolution-scotland-rishi-sunak-glasgow-conference","fields":{"bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has ruled out any further devolution of powers for Scotland after telling Conservative activists that Holyrood should be “held to account” more for underusing its existing powers. The prime minister claimed Holyrood already had significant powers, including over income tax rates, telling delegates at the Scottish Conservatives’ annual conference in Glasgow there was therefore no case for adding to them. “Scotland already is the most powerful devolved assembly anywhere in the world,” he said during a question-and-answer session chaired by Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader. “The SNP and the Scottish government doesn’t even use the powers they already have, so we shouldn’t start talking about any more. What we need to do is hold them to account.” His remarks suggest there will be an intense contest between Labour and the Conservatives over Scotland’s powers at the next general election, which could further divide the anti-independence vote in Scotland. Keir Starmer, the UK Labour leader, has committed his party to sweeping changes in Britain’s political structures, including abolishing the House of Lords, and as-yet-unspecified new powers for Holyrood. He also supports Holyrood’s higher taxes for higher earners – a policy the Tories oppose. As well as reform-minded unionists, Labour hopes to attract pro-independence voters who may see enhanced devolution as a compromise solution now that the prospects of a second independence referendum have greatly subsided after Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation, the SNP’s ill-tempered succession battle and the crisis with the police investigation into SNP finances. In his conference speech later on Friday, Ross abandoned a previous proposal that Tory voters in SNP-Labour and SNP-Liberal Democrat marginals should consider voting tactically by backing the best-placed unionist party instead of automatically voting Tory. That proposal, which Ross made in an interview with the Daily Telegraph this month, was quickly shot down by No 10. Sunak’s remarks and his short speech earlier to delegates were overshadowed by a heated row involving No 10 officials and Scottish political journalists after Downing Street tried to restrict access to a briefing with Sunak to six handpicked newspapers. A large group of reporters, who were accredited to cover the conference and were also members of the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists’ Association, sidestepped party officials and entered the briefing room, followed by television crews. The dispute follows a previous clash between Westminster lobby correspondents and No 10 officials who tried to restrict access to briefings with Boris Johnson to handpicked media outlets. After a protracted and at times fractious standoff in Glasgow, during which No 10 insisted that reporters and TV crews who had not been invited had to leave, and then threatened to cancel the briefing, it took place an hour late with every newspaper reporter present. In his conference-floor appearance, Sunak also said the UK government had the right to sidestep the Scottish parliament by directly funding initiatives at local level in policy areas devolved to Holyrood, as part of its levelling up agenda. The Tories argue that Scotland has two governments – at Holyrood and at Westminster – and that was “really healthy”, Sunak said, adding that it was well-received by Scottish councils and local communities. “We know that in the same way that Westminster doesn’t always know best, it’s not the case that in Scotland the SNP and the Holyrood government always know best,” he said. “We don’t have to just hand everything over to the Scottish government. I think that’s real devolution, or devolution in action at a very local level.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-09T00:10:44Z","webTitle":"Russia suspends US inspections of its nuclear weapons arsenal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/09/russia-suspends-us-inspections-of-its-nuclear-weapons-arsenal","fields":{"bodyText":"Russia has suspended an arrangement that allowed US and Russian inspectors to visit each other’s nuclear weapons sites under the 2010 New Start treaty, in a new blow to arms control. Mutual inspections had been suspended as a health precaution since the start of the Covid pandemic, but a foreign ministry statement on Monday added another reason Russia is unwilling to restart them. It argued that US sanctions imposed because of the invasion of Ukraine stopped Russian inspectors travelling to the US. “There are no similar obstacles to the arrival of American inspectors in Russia,” the statement said. “The Russian foreign ministry raised this issue with the relevant countries, but did not receive an answer.” The US state department did not immediately respond to the claim that the sanctions created an imbalance when it came to nuclear weapons inspections. A spokesperson said: “The United States is committed to implementation of the New Start Treaty, but we keep discussions between the parties concerning treaty implementation confidential.” The treaty, which limits each country’s deployed strategic warheads to 1,550, and imposes limits on delivery systems, was extended for five years in February 2021. It is the last remaining arms control treaty in effect between the US and Russia, and its inspection and verification clauses are widely seen as vital in building mutual confidence and preventing nuclear miscalculation. “At a time when US and Russian relations are tense, anything that undermines stability and nuclear predictability is a concern,” said Jon Wolfsthal, who was senior director for arms control and nonproliferation in the Obama administration’s national security council. “However, we continue to exchange large volumes of information with Russia about their nuclear weapons. The hope is that this is just a political road bump and not a major new obstacle to stability.” While inspections have stalled, Russian nuclear forces have maintained another key part of the New Start agreement, notifications to the US on any movements or changes in status of its nuclear arsenal. “They’ve been stepping up notifications. It’s remarkable,” Rose Gottemoeller, former Nato deputy secretary general and under secretary of state for arms control and international security, said. “Notifications come in to something called the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Centre, which is a centre headquartered in the department of state. They told me one day in May they got 18 notifications. They’ve never seen that number of notifications before,” Gottemoeller, now a lecturer at Stanford University, added. “So it seems like the Russians, at least the Russian nuclear forces, have been intent on trying to continue implementation for mutual predictability and confidence.” Inspections are important way of checking whether a country’s notifications on its nuclear weapons are accurate, but Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based independent analyst on Russian nuclear forces, said they are not the only one. “First, the volume of notifications is sufficiently large so you should be able to detect serious discrepancies,” Podvig, who is also a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, said. “Then, there are always national technical means – they cannot see everything, of course, but serious discrepancies will be detected … So, I wouldn’t say that all is lost for arms control, even though, of course, it’s a rather unfortunate decision on Russia’s part.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T11:00:47Z","webTitle":"Power Failure by William D Cohan review – pulling the plug","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/17/power-failure-by-william-d-cohan-review-pulling-the-plug","fields":{"bodyText":"The executive suite of General Electric’s Connecticut headquarters was known as “carpet land”. Persian rugs and dense wool carpet covered every floor, creating an atmosphere of hushed probity. For almost a century, GE had stamped its curling blue logo on just about everything, from wind turbines to submarine detectors, fridges, televisions, toasters and lightbulbs. The office was a monument to the baronial power of its CEO. Jeff Immelt, the final chief to occupy this floor, enjoyed the use of a shoeshine station, a pantry and dining room. His two assistants also had their own private bathroom. When Immelt travelled by private jet, as he often did, a second, empty jet would often trail behind him in case of mechanical failures on the first plane. At its peak, GE was an industrial empire worth almost $600bn. When Immelt became CEO in 2001, he inherited one of the most valuable companies in the world. It was so trustworthy that it had a triple-A credit score, the same rating given to government debt. Fast forward two decades and that huge company is about to disappear. In November 2021, General Electric announced it would be broken up into smaller fragments. Over the previous few years its number of employees had fallen by more than half. The founder of GE, Thomas Edison, was credited with inventing the lightbulb. By the 2000s, the company had started sourcing its lightbulbs from Chinese contractors and branding them as GE products. In 2020, GE sold off its lighting business for good. William D Cohan’s new book, Power Failure, is a digressive history of what went wrong behind closed doors. Cohan, a business writer and former investment banker, covers almost a century of imperial expansion and errors of judgment. He focuses on the insular politics of the boardroom and the machinations of its executives, rarely pausing to consider the transformation that GE’s products or corporate culture wreaked on the wider world. Instead, Power Failure hinges on two antagonists: the late Jack Welch, the heedless, tyrannical chief executive who was said to advocate firing 10% of his workforce every year, and his successor Immelt, an obstinate sales manager who, as one of Cohan’s sources puts it, was merely “masquerading as a CEO”. Welch, the restless only son of working-class Irish-American parents, became CEO of GE a few months after Ronald Reagan became president. He was a qualified chemist, but his fortunes rose when he learned the art of financial engineering. Welch transformed GE Credit, a programme launched at the height of the Great Depression that allowed customers to buy appliances and pay for them later, into a financial powerhouse. Under his leadership, the company used its stellar credit rating to borrow cheaply in unsecured markets and lend this money to borrowers at higher interest rates, pocketing the difference. Welch often remarked how effortless it was: “I thought it was easier than bending metal,” he told Cohan, who worked for GE’s financial arm for two years when he was still in his 20s. “It was a home run.” He turned GE into a company that made money from money. Welch displayed a zealous concern for earnings targets (the Financial Times once called him the “number whisperer”). Often, he would reduce overheads by simply firing people (he fired more than 100,000 staff in his first few years as CEO), or by outsourcing GE’s work to other companies in countries with lower labour costs. But there was another, more contentious source of his uncanny ability to produce ever-increasing growth. The Wall Street Journal accused GE of engaging in “earnings management”, the practice of smoothing out gains and losses in order to produce the illusion of steadily rising profits on a balance sheet (accusations that Welch vehemently denied). In any case, he had created a company whose value was like a skyscraper built on sand, prone to crumbing as soon as the landscape beneath it shifted. Soon, the profits from GE Capital far outstripped those made from inventing things, or producing X-ray machines and jet propulsion engines. Immelt tried to stem the company’s reliance on financial speculation, but he ended up by inviting the enemy in. In 2015, Trian Partners, an asset management firm known for shaking up underperforming companies, became a top investor. Billionaire co-founder Nelson Peltz, who voted for Trump in 2016, was relentless in his pursuit of shareholder value, so it was perhaps inevitable that the firm would demand changes – including Immelt’s head. GE now has a new CEO, Larry Culp, who works closely with Peltz (neither spoke with Cohan for the book). Last year, Culp finally “pulled the plug on the company”. At more than 700 pages, Power Failure asks a lot of its reader. Halfway through, a blurry feeling settled over me as the narrative thread was unwound by detours about where particular executives went to university or whom they married. Cohan quotes at length from interviews with Welch, whose anecdotes feel a little too neat, as if you’re listening to a faded power broker recount their best stories across a bar. The rise and fall of GE is explained as the product of individual men and their mercurial decisions, yet its fate has a wider significance. It ought to be a warning: cost-cutting, outsourcing and financial speculation produce a warped model of value that is liable to collapse. • Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon by William D Cohan is published by Penguin (£35).

The joint view comes as EU foreign affairs ministers slapped human rights sanctions on the Iranian morality police over their handling of street protests and treatment of women. The drone strikes continued in Ukraine on Monday, killing three more people, according to the mayor of Kyiv. Despite the French-British belief that Iran is breaching the UN security council resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal by supplying the drones, there is no immediate plan to refer the issue to the UN, but diplomatic sources said the issue was live. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said Iran’s supply of drones to Russia constituted a breach of UN security council resolution 2231, which was unanimously adopted six days after the nuclear deal was signed in Vienna, and called on UN member states to refrain “from actions that undermine implementation of commitments”. “The UK has condemned Iran’s decision to supply drones and training to Russia. Iran supplying drones is inconsistent with UN security council resolution 2231 and is further evidence of the role Iran plays in undermining global security,” the spokesperson said. “The UK will continue to work with our partners to hold Iran to account for its destabilising behaviour around the world.” The French foreign ministry spokesperson last week revealed Paris had noted “a great deal of information that reports the use of Iranian drones by the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, in bombardments that were aimed at civilian targets”. Although a ban on Iranian arms exports expired in 2020, the nuclear deal signed in 2015, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA), retains a ban on any activity related to ballistic missiles until 2023. France and the UK say Iran, in supplying drones, is in breach of obligations under parts of the JCPoA and the missile technology control regime that limits the proliferation of missiles. The west has the ability to “snapback” on some sanctions if it asserts Iran is breaching the JCPoA. More practically it is inconceivable that the west will resume negotiations about renewing the nuclear deal so long as there is clear evidence that Iran is supplying arms to help Russia defeat Ukraine. The talks are effectively on hold until after the US midterm elections, even though Iran is continuing to expand its use of more sophisticated centrifuges. The Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Naser Kanani, in his weekly press conference again denied Iran was supplying drones to Russia, challenging claims by the US, Ukraine and many arms specialists that Iranian-manufactured Shahed-136 drones were in clear use. He said: “Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not a party to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Iran has not exported any weapons to any of the warring parties. As we have said many times, Iran’s foreign policy is based on opposing war, and regarding the war in Ukraine, we are also against war, and we are trying to end the military approach in this field.” The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has in the recent past spoken of a new military pact with Russia, but not referred to a specific deal on drone exports. Iranian journalists have repeatedly challenged the foreign ministry about its denials. The US warned on Monday that it would take action against companies and nations working with Iran’s drone program, describing the deepening alliance between Moscow and Tehran as “a profound threat”. “Anyone doing business with Iran that could have any link to UAVs or ballistic missile developments or the flow of arms from Iran to Russia should be very careful and do their due diligence – the US will not hesitate to use sanctions or take actions against perpetrators,” said a State Department spokesperson. Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv military administration, said last week that explosions at a military base 75km south of the city, wounding one, had been carried out by these drones. The highly effective “kamikaze” drones have been used with great effect, and are seen as a cheap alternative to missiles. EU foreign ministers imposed sanctions on 11 Iranian security officers and four entities including the morality police on Monday in response to the crackdown on protests triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurd. The EU list goes further than the recently announced British and US sanctions, but still stops short of the systematic attack on Iranian regime supporters and family members in Europe that is being sought by some Iranians. In common with Washington, the EU sanctioned Iran’s morality police and two of its key figures, Mohammad Rostami and Haj Ahmad Mirzaei. In addition, the EU designates the Iranian Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), as well as a number of its local chiefs, for their role in the repression of the protests. The EU also listed Issa Zarepour, the Iranian minister of information and communications technology, for his responsibility over the internet shutdown. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps cyber-defence command was also the subject of sanctions. Anoosheh Ashoori, one of the former British-Iranian dual nationals released from Evin prison after nearly five years in detention, said the west needed to go much further in enforcing sanctions. “There is no point imposing sanctions only on the morality police that are not going to come to Europe. But there are a large number of children and relatives of the regime that, like the Russian oligarchs, like living the high life here and have assets here. “Britain cannot have dealings with a regime that kills children and detains people for the amount of hair they show. This regime is brutal and has no red lines. Britain will be asked when this regime falls whether it was on the right side of history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T16:55:46Z","webTitle":"Net zero strategy shows UK will miss 2030 emissions cuts target ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","fields":{"bodyText":"The UK government has said it is still on track to meet its international climate commitments under the Paris agreement, as analysis of its energy plans suggested more drastic policies would be needed to make the required carbon cuts. Ministers announced the UK’s revamped net zero strategy on Thursday, with a raft of documents exceeding 1,000 pages, setting out policies on sectors from biomass to solar power, and from electric vehicles to nuclear reactors. It came as Rishi Sunak headed to Oxfordshire to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, accompanied by Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary. The prime minister said: “People should be really proud of the UK’s track record on all of this. If you look at it, we’ve decarbonised faster than any other major economy. Our carbon emissions have been reduced by over 40%, much more than all the other countries that we compete with.” Shapps later told Sky News: “We all know that electricity can be a big way to decarbonise, but we also know these are big changes. So this is not a sort of rip-out-your-boiler moment. This is a transition over a period of time to get to homes which are heated in a different way and also insulated much better.” The government’s analysis, however, shows that its new policies will meet only 92% of the emissions cuts required and, without further changes, the target will be missed. At the heart of its strategy is the UK’s legally binding requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and its commitment under the Paris agreement to a plan – called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – to cut emissions by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The 2030 pledge, boasted of as “world-leading” in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, is vital to get the UK on track to meet the long-term goal, and will be closely scrutinised by other governments. Within the dense pages of analysis and recommendations, the official assessment of the NDC stood out: “We have quantified emissions savings to deliver 88 megatonnes or 92% of the NDC. We are confident that the delivery of emissions savings by unquantified policies detailed in this package will largely close this gap and the government will bring forward further measures to ensure [it] will meet its international commitments if required.” However, Chris Venables, the head of politics at Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Our analysis shows that even that 92% is a very generous reading. It is hard to celebrate an announcement that says itself it’s not enough. The bottom line is that this plan doesn’t plot a route to net zero. There are only so many times we can claim climate leadership while falling short of our own targets.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told MPs: “A target for less than seven years’ time, and they [the government] are miles off … all of the policies, all of the hot air, don’t meet the target they promised on the world stage.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the Guardian: “We remain committed to delivering our international commitments, including the 2030 NDC under the Paris agreement which we fully expect to meet. We are on track to deliver our carbon budgets, creating jobs and investment across the UK while reducing emissions. Our carbon budget delivery plan is a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 15 years, setting us on course to reach net zero by 2050.” A few of the winners … Electric vehicles Car manufacturers must ensure a proportion of their sales are of electric vehicles – 22% of cars and 10% of vans by 2024 – under a zero emissions vehicle mandate, though campaigners said the proportion had been set too low. About £800m in capital funding is being made available for electric vehicles, and there will be a boost to EV charging infrastructure. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Much of the government’s strategy for continuing with fossil fuel development – with decisions on potential new oil and gas fields imminent – rests on the deployment of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological formations under the North Sea. The government shortlisted eight projects to move ahead in its funding scheme, including one backed by oil giant BP, and expects to make £20bn of investment available over 20 years in CCS. Hydrogen and nuclear The government named 20 new hydrogen projects that are on track to receive a share of £240m, to help the development of a fuel the government sees as central to the UK’s low-carbon future. It comes despite doubts among experts over some of its applications – particularly in home heating – and some of its sources, as fossil fuel companies are looking to hydrogen to allow them to continue drilling. Great British Nuclear will be a new organisation intended to come forward with small nuclear projects that the government believes will be key to its aim of generating a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear by 2050. And some of the gaps and the losers … Onshore wind The government dashed hopes that its new strategy might lift the ban on onshore windfarms in England. The lack of action has frustrated leading academics and green groups because onshore windfarms could begin powering the grid far sooner than nuclear reactors, and would help to reduce energy bills. Dr Daniel Quiggin, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said onshore wind could bring greater real emissions reductions than removing emissions from the air via carbon capture technology. Grid connections While the government hopes to boost renewable power generation, and nuclear energy, there was little detail on how to solve one of the most pressing problems for the UK’s ageing electricity network. New windfarms and other sources of power, and the battery storage facilities needed to smooth out the intermittency of renewable power, can wait years for the grid connections they need, partly owing to the difficulty of getting planning permission and partly to a lack of grid capacity. Andy Willis, the founder of Kona Energy, said: “Without significant grid connection reform, the vast potential of clean energy development will linger, trapped behind red tape and bureaucratic delays.” Farming There was little reference to agriculture, even though farming and food prices are highly sensitive to energy costs and agriculture is one of the biggest single sources of UK emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was involved in the Whitehall discussions around Thursday’s announcements, but a key land use strategy is not due until the end of June. Then, both the future of farming emissions and the potential for growing trees and restoring landscapes to store carbon – and offset the UK’s remaining emissions by 2050 – will be addressed. Biomass There was drama on the stock market on Thursday as shares in Drax, which operates the UK’s biggest power station burning biomass, fell early on after the government appeared to reject its plea for increased subsidies for a project to capture and store the carbon dioxide from its wood burning. But Drax quickly pointed out that the main decisions on subsidies will follow later, by the end of June, when a biomass strategy is promised. The market confusion arose, the company claimed, because the government had separated its process for supporting hydrogen, gas and CCS projects from its consideration of biomass subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-09-02T11:00:03Z","webTitle":"Blazin’ Squad look back: ‘We needed chaperones – it wasn’t great for our credibility’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/02/blazin-squad-look-back-we-needed-chaperones-it-wasnt-great-for-our-credibility","fields":{"bodyText":"The 10 original members of Blazin’ Squad met at school in Chingford, north-east London. Known for their fusion of pop, R&amp;B and rap, they had their first hit in 2002 with a cover of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony’s Crossroads. A further six Top 10 singles followed, as well as two gold records and a sold-out arena tour. The crew’s current lineup is Spike E (Sam Foulkes), Rocky B (Marcel Somerville), Freek (Ollie Georgiou) and Melo D (Chris McKeckney). They play Reminisce festival on 9 September. Sam (new image, sitting) The boys used to take the mick back then, as I had a baby face. Looking at this image from Smash Hits, they were right: my face is so swollen, it’s like I’ve been stung by a bee. I couldn’t grow facial hair until I was 19. Thankfully, my head has slimmed down by 300%. My hairline’s gone back a fair bit, too. None of us were proactively trying to get famous. Everything just aligned: when we were 15, a guy at school was doing work experience at a studio. He knew we’d done garage and MC’d at parties, so he said we could record a demo for £200. After that, he asked us to come back again, but this time we could do it for free. A few weeks later, he called to say some A&amp;Rs from East West Records wanted to meet us. When we got there they said: “Can you MC in front of us, right now?” It was terrifying! A week later, we were in Kensington with lawyers, having dinner and signing contracts. Two weeks later we were performing in South Africa, and a week after that we had our first No 1. But one minute we were selling out Wembley, the next our phones stopped ringing and we had to find new ways to make money. We could have let the end of the group eat us up, but we didn’t. We cracked on, and I’m always in the mindset that if Blazin’ Squad stopped tomorrow, I’d be gutted but OK. Marcel (on left) Me and Melo were always at the back of photos as everyone else was shorter than us. That’s why I’m crouching in such a random pose; it’s what I had to do to get into the shot. We were promoting our second album at the time. The entire Blazin’ Squad experience was epic, but we were making our best music at this point: Flip Reverse, Here 4 One, We Just Be Dreamin’ – it was good times. Crossroads going to No 1 was crazy, but the music on that first album wasn’t necessarily us and there was a lot of input from the label. On the second record, we got a bit more control. We were living that pop star lifestyle, too – out in the West End, VIP treatment. Not something we ever imagined as a bunch of teenagers from Chingford. We carried on making a third album even though we didn’t have a deal, but when we played it to our managers they didn’t see our vision – they had ideas about how we could be more mainstream. We were ready to embrace the digital age and self-release but they were more hesitant. In the end, the group naturally faded out – people got jobs and moved on. In 2009, the four of us started to do some small gigs, then in 2017, after I got made redundant from my job, I decided to sign up for Love Island. After going on the show, Blazin’ Squad blew up again: we got booked for all the festivals. Our Spotify streams increased by 3,000%. The 10 of us have remained friends now for 20 years, but while it would be incredible to get the original lineup on stage, I don’t think it’s going to happen. Everyone’s off doing their own thing: Kenzie is a superstar DJ, MoJam [Mustafa Omer and James Murray] have written loads of successful songs. I might be the most famous member now, though, which is great, because I used to be in the background. The world turns, things change, and these days there’s room for everyone at the front. Ollie (on right) I’ve no memory of this shoot, but I’m grateful I didn’t get ripped off as bad as Sam did with those bootcut jeans. Even if he got to keep the Timberlands. Things moved fast for Blazin’ Squad. In our first year, we went 323 days without a day off. The 4am call times for early morning TV shows were a bit hard to manage as we had to be bubbly, but apart from that it was amazing. One of my highlights was getting asked by Kool and the Gang to cover their song Joanna. We got to meet them, too, but my hair was atrocious that day. I have incredibly curly hair and all I ever wanted was for it to be straight, so I got it done and I ended up looking like I had a lion’s mane. As we were so young at the start, we needed chaperones until we were 16, which was not great for credibility, especially if we were meeting new people: “Hi, yeah, nice to meet you. Here’s my dad. He has to come with me everywhere I go.” We couldn’t get up to all the things teenagers get up to without getting into a lot of shit. But by album No 2 we could, and we did. Groups like So Solid Crew, Busted, Sugababes and Girls Aloud really put their arms around us. We were like their little brothers. We had beef with David Sneddon for a bit – for some reason the acts from Fame Academy were not our greatest fans. But as there were so many of us in the group it was hard to branch out and make new friends. It was probably quite intimidating for people to come over to talk to us. We weren’t rude, we just kept to ourselves. It was a bit daunting when the group ended. I was a bit embarrassed, thinking: “Oh God, what will people think of me? Am I just a failed pop star?” To a degree, that was accurate, but realistically the fame was never going to last for ever. The best thing is that we are still all good mates, and all of these experiences make our bond pretty strong. Chris (in phone box) That’s me behind two band members in the phone box. Me and Marcel got pushed to the back because we were the tallest. That’s the reason I was told, anyway. My favourite memories are of the first day of tour: we’d wait outside a Chingford pub with our parents and the bus would arrive. We were energetic teenage boys and we’d pile in and drive off, waving to our parents from the windows. That’s when the fun would really start. There was always a lot of joking around, so we never got time to be nervous. We’d just done our GCSEs and nobody had cared about us at school. Suddenly we were on stage with thousands of fans screaming our names. There was no chance anyone would get too big for their boots, though: you’d immediately get slapped back down by the rest of the group. We’ve all got our jobs and families now, so when we do shows we appreciate it more because it’s an escape from normality. My baby son came to see his first Blazin’ Squad show on Father’s Day. When we did Crossroads, each of us brought our kids on stage. That was a nice moment. The Blazin’ Squad junior crew! Maybe they’ll take over: they’ve already outnumbered us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-10T17:27:07Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on China and Ukraine: beware great expectations | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-ukraine-beware-great-expectations","fields":{"bodyText":"Straddles are, by their nature, uncomfortable positions to maintain. So it isn’t surprising that China’s attempt to hold together conflicting interests on the war in Ukraine – maintaining its “no limits” partnership with Russia, without damaging its relationship with western nations and its tarnished global brand too greatly – has proved awkward. Attention increased when its special envoy for Eurasian affairs, Li Hui, joined talks in Jeddah last weekend, having avoided similar talks in Copenhagen earlier this summer. European officials described China’s involvement as “active” and said that it “appeared constructive”. The verb may be as important as the adjective: China is manoeuvring around the conflict, not fundamentally repositioning itself. Xi Jinping finally held a phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in April – but only after a senior diplomat caused outrage by questioning the sovereignty of former Soviet republics. The Jeddah talks were immediately followed by reassurance to Moscow that nothing had changed. Many in China view the invasion not in moral terms, but more cynically, especially given their suspicion of the US and, by extension, Nato. But the conflict has usefully diverted US energy from tackling the tense bilateral relationship. It has made Moscow more reliant on Beijing – and more clearly subordinate. China also perceives that Russia is not looking for a swift exit, but bedding itself in for a long war, not least because a second term for Donald Trump would dramatically improve its position, and Ukraine’s counteroffensive is not making the headway that many hoped for. That allows Beijing to monitor both a modern war and western responses to it – information that would be helpful were it to move against Taiwan. The head of MI6, Richard Moore, said last month that Beijing was “absolutely complicit” on Ukraine, supporting Moscow diplomatically and pushing Russian talking points. China has not criticised the invasion – or even acknowledged it as such – but attacks “unilateral sanctions”. It has thrown Russia an economic lifeline. Chinese firms are providing equipment that is useful to the military as well as civilians, such as body armour and drones. But China has not supplied arms and does not want the conflict to escalate, or to spill over into the broader region. Nor does it want to see further consolidation of the west, for both security and economic reasons. It knows that its partnership with Russia has hardened European attitudes towards it. The Wagner mutiny will also have given it pause for thought. And it wants to be regarded, especially by representatives of the global south such as those present in Jeddah, as a peacemaker standing above the fray. Its expressions of concern about the use of nuclear weapons look like hints to the west as well as warnings to Moscow: don’t push Vladimir Putin too far. Nonetheless, if they have any effect in restraining Russia, that can only be welcome. China, the biggest importer of Ukrainian grain, also has entirely pragmatic reasons for encouraging Russia to return to the Black Sea grain deal. It has highlighted the need to address the safety of nuclear power plants. And some hope it could play a useful, if marginal, role in negotiations eventually. The most important question, however, may still be what it does not do: whether it holds back from increasing support for Russia. That is why Kyiv is stepping carefully itself, as it seeks to avoid antagonising Beijing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T18:11:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are, broadly speaking, ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready. Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Reports were emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-31T17:49:58Z","webTitle":"Electricity firms face penalties for ‘manipulating’ grid in Ofgem crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/aug/31/uk-electricity-firms-face-penalties-for-manipulating-grid","fields":{"bodyText":"Electricity companies will no longer be able to deploy a controversial tactic that forces up bills at the expense of consumers, the energy watchdog has said as it unveiled rules designed to curb firms making “excessive” profits in the winter. Ofgem said electricity generators could face “stiff penalties” of up to 10% of their revenue for breaching the new regulations, which aim to prevent manipulation of the complex system that keeps Britain’s electricity grid stable. The “balancing mechanism” is the main tool used by the National Grid electricity system operator (ESO) to plug gaps between supply and demand on the network. It allows the ESO to do deals with generators at short notice to ensure the right amount of electricity supply to maintain relative equilibrium on the grid, preventing imbalances that can cause problems such as power outages. Under the balancing mechanism electricity generators get paid varying rates for turning their output up or down, on a minute-by-minute basis. The cost of this system is ultimately borne by bill payers via “network costs” included on bills. Ofgem said it had acted on concerns that some generators were “taking advantage” of the balancing mechanism, at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds to households already struggling with sky-high energy costs. The watchdog said that in previous winters some electricity generators had deliberately stopped generating power early in the afternoon, meaning plants were switched off during the crucial evening spike in demand. They would then offer to resume generating power later in the day, cashing in on the greatly increased prices on offer via the balancing mechanism. Annual balancing costs tripled in the winter of 2021-22, as power prices surged to record highs, rising to £1.5bn compared with an average of £500m in the previous three years, Ofgem said. Daily balancing costs hit a record of £60m on a single Wednesday, 24 November 2021, while the total annual balancing cost paid for by consumers reached £3.1bn during that financial year. Ofgem’s measures affect the companies that generate electricity at power plants, rather than the suppliers that charge households directly. However, the costs of the balancing mechanism are ultimately passed on to consumers through their bills. According to an investigation by Bloomberg this year, the companies that benefited from inflated electricity prices include SSE, the German state-owned power firm Uniper, and VPI, which is owned by the commodities trading firm Vitol. Ofgem said the new Inflexible Offers Licence Condition (IOLC), which comes into effect on 26 October, would ban this practice and would apply to any generators that switched off their plant for more than an hour. Firms can be fined up to 10% of their revenues and forced to make redress to consumers under Ofgem’s existing licence conditions. Eleanor Warburton, the regulator’s acting director for energy systems management and security, said: “These new licence conditions show Ofgem will not tolerate electricity generators attempting to take advantage of the balancing mechanism system to make excessive profits through inflexible generation. “We believe the new licence condition strikes the right balance between protecting consumers and ensuring they pay a fair price for their energy while also enabling a competitive electricity market that provides fair returns for generators. We’ll be monitoring the effectiveness of it to ensure it’s doing what it was designed to do.” The actions Ofgem’s new rules are designed to prevent were not in breach of electricity generators’ licence conditions at the time they took place. The trade body Energy UK, which represents energy firms including electricity generators, said: “Balancing costs are ultimately paid by customers so it’s right that Ofgem looks at ways to reduce these costs through this measure and other changes to the balancing mechanism. “The best way to reduce balancing costs over the long term will be through enabling a more competitive and transparent market and an approach to balancing that capitalises on the increasing amounts of low-carbon flexible assets across the UK, from energy storage to demand-side response.” A spokesperson for the power company VPI said it was a “responsible participant” in the UK power market and would continue to abide by all relevant regulations. VPI was investing £500m to increase power generation capacity, it said. A spokesperson for SSE said: “As a responsible operator SSE fully complies with all relevant rules and regulations.” The Guardian has approached Uniper for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-02T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"‘Bristol is ready to give us power’: Greens hopeful of win in pivotal byelection","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/feb/02/bristol-is-ready-to-give-us-power-greens-hopeful-of-win-in-pivotal-byelection","fields":{"bodyText":"The issues that have been raised on the doorstep during the campaign have tended to be local ones – from concerns over new housing developments to the state of the pavements and plans to increase fees paid by people who live on boats in the harbour. But a council byelection taking place at Bristol city council on Thursday may have national implications should the Green party manage to pinch the ward from the Lib Dems. If the Greens do win – and they lost last time to the Lib Dems by only 26 votes – they would become the biggest party on Bristol city council, which they say would be a significant shift and one they believe would put them in pole position to eventually win power at city hall and a parliamentary seat at the next general election. “It does feel like an important moment,” said Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the Green party in England and Wales and herself a Bristol city councillor, speaking while out on the campaign trail in the ward, Hotwells and Harbourside. “For a start, it would be part of the trend of the Greens making gains here. The Greens are already the joint biggest group on Bristol city council with 24 councillors, the same as Labour. We know there’s a massive appetite for Green politics in Bristol.” Bristol is traditionally thought of as a Labour city but the Greens drew level, at least as far as the number of councillors was concerned, in May 2021. It means they already have more councillors in Bristol than in any other local authority. However, it did not lead to access to the levers of power as Bristol has a Labour directly elected mayor, Marvin Rees, and he resisted calls for Greens to be given cabinet posts. “He could have chosen to have a cross-party cabinet – he opted to have a 100% Labour cabinet,” said Denyer. She does not expect much to change immediately if the Greens win on Thursday. “I’m not holding my breath that he will hand over the keys of the city.” But major changes are afoot with the city voting last year to scrap the mayoral role, returning to a committee system from 2024. How this will work is being hammered out but a win at this byelection, followed by strong showings at the next council elections in May 2024, will help the Green cause. “I do think the direction of travel demonstrated by Green results in the last few elections shows Bristol is ready to give Greens power,” said Denyer. “There’s a change of the guard in the air.” Denyer is also the Green’s MP candidate for Bristol West. In the 2019 general election she came second, nearly doubling the Greens’ previous vote share. Of the 20 councillors in Bristol West, 16 are Greens and winning in Hotwells and Harbourside would make it 17. “It would a boost to our chances of winning the Bristol West seat,” said Denyer. She was out with the candidate for Hotwells and Harbourside, Patrick McAllister, who works locally in legal services, trying to persuade a few last “undecideds” that Green was the way to go. McAllister said he was determined to secure a fairer, greener future for his ward and the city. “People talk about those local issues – the housing developments, the boat charges and so on, but also about things like council tax going up and how they afford it at a time of a cost of living crisis.” The campaign has not been without controversies. The scandal of flammable cladding affects many residents in the ward, including the Labour candidate, Eileen Means, who has said resolving the issue will be her top priority. The Lib Dem’s Hotwells candidate, Stephen Williams, a former UK government junior minister in the Cameron-Clegg coalition, has accused the Greens of trying to “smear” him during the campaign by suggesting he could have done more to address fire safety issues when he was in power. “It shows how desperate they are.” Williams, who was Bristol West MP from 2005 to 2015 and has previously served as a city councillor, claimed the Greens had not really focused on important local issues during the campaign, such as plans to build hundreds of new harbourside homes and a controversial road scheme. “Almost the entire focus of their campaign has been: ‘Give us another councillor, then we’ll be really big’ and they’ve hardly been talking about local issues. There are 50 things they could have campaigned on. I’m puzzled. Ironically, they’ve been producing an avalanche of leaflets, a forest of them.” Thecandidates for the byelection are: Stephen Williams (Lib Dem), Patrick McAllister (Green), Eileen Means (Labour), Eliana Barbosa (Conservative), Martin Booth (Independent)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T11:00:39Z","webTitle":"Power tools are scary so it’s handheld pruners for my hedges | Alys Fowler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2022/dec/09/power-tools-are-scary-so-its-handheld-pruners-for-my-hedges","fields":{"bodyText":"I am drowning in prunings, tripping over the stuff every time I try to hang out the washing, and still I have yet to make even a dent in the hedge. If I were a different person I would either get someone else to do it, or at least buy myself the mother of all hedge trimmers and make light work of it all. But I am not that person. I am one who has a deep, and perhaps deeply un-lesbian, distrust of power tools. I just don’t like how fast they go. Thus, my only option is to spend the winter going at it bit by bit, by hand, until one day we can all see the light through the tangle of branches. I already own a Wolf-Garten multi-change tool with a telescopic handle that can reach up to three metres. I’ve got two heads for it: the adjustable anvil tree lopper that cuts through branches up to 40mm in diameter as if they are made of butter; and the professional pruning saw, which rips through anything big with such ease it is slightly terrifying. I can’t recommend these tools highly enough if you’ve got tall things to prune and no space or budget for a serious tripod ladder. You can also, if you have massive hands, take the pruning saw off and use it as a hand saw. If you don’t, I recommend the Silky Natanoko pruning saw from Japan, partly because its handle is smaller and made of rubber. This is a fixed-blade saw with coarse teeth, perfect for fresh wood. Like all Japanese saws, it cuts on the pull, which means it’s less effort, but you must make sure it doesn’t bend as you cut, otherwise it is liable to snap. If this does happen, at least you can replace the blades and, more importantly, you can sharpen them too. It’s an investment, at more than £60, but should last a lifetime if looked after well. If that’s too much, a Z pruning saw with coarse serrations is a very reasonable second choice, costing just over £20. On top of that you’ll need some loppers. I’ve tried many in my time and think most telescopic sorts are just not tough enough. Bypass loppers are great for smaller stuff (under 300mm diameter), but for bigger branches you need to buy the sturdiest anvil loppers you can find, such as a pair of Bulldog compound anvil lopping shears.

Ratcliffe-on-Soar had initially been pencilled in to shut in 2022, but last year said it would have an initial extension until 31 March 2023. The planned closure forms part of the government’s attempt to remove coal from Britain’s energy generation to cut carbon emissions. One of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was due to shut in September 2022, but it will now close in line with three other units at the station in September 2024. Coal-fired plants provided more than 40% of Britain’s electricity a decade ago, but that figure had fallen to 1.5% by last year. Ministers have set a goal for Britain to stop using coal altogether. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to countries boycotting Russian gas. Emergency contracts were drawn up between energy suppliers and National Grid to keep stations open as back-up options. So far none of the coal-fire powered stations asked to stay online this winter as a precaution have been asked to supply power, the Daily Telegraph reports. The power station and its distinctive eight concrete cooling towers can be seen next to the Midland mainline railway line between London and Leeds. The news comes as Britain generated a record amount of electricity from wind turbines on Tuesday. National Grid data showed that 21.6GW of electricity was supplied by wind early in the evening, about 50% of the power needed across Britain at 6pm and 6.30pm. This is a time of day where demand is traditionally high, as people return from work or start to prepare evening meals. It is the second time in two weeks that the wind record has been broken in Britain, after a previous best was set on 30 December. The German energy giant Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire plant, said: “As requested by the government, Uniper is now looking at whether we can make the unit available to run under standard market arrangements until the September 2024 coal phase-out date. “We have prequalified the unit to take part in the capacity market T-1 auction for 2023/24 [an auction for back-up power]. This means further investment to extend the life of the unit. The power station is set to close at the end of September 2024.” A government spokesman said: “The UK has a secure and diverse energy system, and we remain confident in our security of supply. “Working closely with Ofgem, National Grid Gas and other key industry organisations, we continuously monitor our energy supply and ensure we are ready for a range of scenarios. “In line with our net zero target, the government is planning to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation by the end of 2024.” • This article was amended on 12 January and 13 January 2023 to clarify in the text and headline that three of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar were already due to remain open until 2024."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T08:30:12Z","webTitle":"‘No chance’ of global heating below 1.5C but nuclear tech ‘promising’ in climate crisis, Bill Gates says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/jan/23/no-chance-of-global-heating-below-15c-but-nuclear-tech-promising-in-climate-crisis-bill-gates-says","fields":{"bodyText":"The world will be lucky to avoid 2.5C of heating, but emerging technology may help avert even worse, Bill Gates has told a Sydney audience. The US billionaire and philanthropist told the Lowy Institute on Monday that while malaria still killed more children – 400,000 a year – the climate crisis was “worth investing in massively because it will get worse and worse over time”. There was “no chance” of limiting warming to the Paris climate goal of 1.5C compared with pre-industrial levels, and it was “very unlikely” it could be kept to 2C, Gates said. “The key is to minimise the warming as much as possible,” he said. “At this point, to stay below 2.5C would be pretty fantastic. I do think that’s possible.” Gates remains among the world’s richest people, despite having donated $US35bn ($50bn) to mid-2022, with his former wife, Melinda Gates, and pledging another $US20bn. Asked about the policies of the government led by Anthony Albanese, whom Gates met over the weekend, the Microsoft founder said it was “great to have Australia on board on climate” after the country had been an “outlier until quite recently”. The country was “very blessed” with renewable energy resources and the minerals needed for a transition away from carbon. “Australia is rare in that the opportunities exceed what you have to give up,” he said. Gates said his investment in the Perth-based firm Rumin8, announced on Monday, was his 103rd foray into climate start-ups, from energy and aircraft to steel. Rumin8 aims to reduce methane emissions from cattle. Nuclear fission and fusion were both “very, very promising” energy sources not dependent on the weather for generation, he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Still, he said the government’s approach to wait 15 years for proof that the technology of small modular reactors was safe and cheap and the waste can be handled “was a very good attitude”. “I don’t know whether it will succeed,” he said. “I’ve put billions of dollars into [nuclear technology], so I must think there’s some chance.” “Even if nuclear succeeds, we’re still going to need 60-70% renewables,” Gates said. “I think the world is underinvested in those [nuclear] innovations because they could make a huge difference.” On other issues, Gates said there were still “huge factors pushing for global trade”, even with a “fear of dependency on China”. These include the cross-border need for copper, lithium and cobalt “as part of the green energy revolution”. “It is sad that we’re evolving into a world where [there’s] the willingness, certainly of the US, to be independent of things from China,” he said. “It will create significant inefficiencies if globalisation goes into reverse.” Still, Gates said he was hopeful that major advances were still possible to tackle many health and other issues. “We will cure obesity, we will cure cancer, we will eradicate polio,” he said. “I’m still very optimistic that it will be much better to be born 20, 40, 60 years from now than [at] any time in the past.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T14:00:19Z","webTitle":"Actors are still being put under pressure to perform intimate scenes – I see it happen | Adelaide Waldrop ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/11/actors-pressure-intimate-scenes-tv-film-romeo-and-juliet-consent","fields":{"bodyText":"Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting’s lawsuit against Paramount for child abuse in Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet highlights the myriad complexities involved in filming intimate scenes. Thanks to modern legislation on child sexual abuse, 55 years on some of the issues raised in this case are no longer risks; but many dangers remain in the television and film sector today. I have worked in the industry for almost as long as an intimacy coordinator can have, given that the role officially originated in 2017. In that time, I’ve choreographed a wide range of intimate scenes – from sci-fi orgies to medieval childbirth. I’ve worked with child actors (who are defined in the UK as those under school leaving age) in scenes where consent and boundaries are needed, for example where children are cuddled or kissed by adult actors playing their parents. Ensuring informed consent when working with an underaged actor is morally ambiguous at best, but there are some hard lines. Child actors cannot legally consent for themselves, nor can they legally perform nude on camera, especially not in a sexual context. Hussey and Whiting were 15 and 16, respectively, when they were filmed naked in Zeffirelli’s classic, ages that would exclude them from the same situation today. A child actor may be made aware of the full context of a scene or they may not be – depending on their age, parent/guardian’s guidance, and the recommendations of a child psychologist. Consent of a parent/guardian is always required, but depending on the age and maturity of a young actor, they may have a limited ability to understand what they are being asked to do, or the potential consequences of their performance living on in perpetuity. Even for adult actors who consent to onscreen nudity or simulated sex, there are complications. How can we be fully confident any actor won’t feel differently about their performance a day, a week or even 50 years down the line? The short answer: there are no guarantees. Part of the intimacy coordinator’s role is to help mitigate this risk as much as possible – not only to protect the actor, but to protect the production’s liability as well. Establishing clear, transparent communication around intimate content early in production is paramount. Ideally, an intimacy coordinator is brought on prior to the casting process, helping ensure that any actor accepting a role with scripted intimacy is doing so from a place of informed consent from the very start. However, I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been hired to aid in a casting process this way. In the case of Hussey and Whiting, it appears that in early conversations they were assured that they would not have to perform nude. Later in the shoot, Zeffirelli reportedly changed his mind. Here is where fraught dynamics embedded in the industry continue to permeate and create risk. Often, a director or producer will emphasise that they’ve spoken with an actor who is “fine” or “totally chill” about intimate content, but when the actor has the opportunity to speak with me, they may express significantly different comfort levels. Even with the best of intentions or the most trusting working relationship, the implicit power held by someone well-connected with reverential status who is perceived as a gatekeeper to a notoriously impenetrable industry – and who may have hiring and firing power over an actor who has probably jumped through countless hoops just to get in the room – is undeniable.The most frequent mishandlings of intimacy by productions seem to arise when time pressures and last-minute changes come into play. The job of a producer is to make a project achievable, however they can. The entire production team is composed of creative problem solvers, masters of the quick pivot. However, when these last-minute changes affect the timing or content of an intimate scene, this time pressure is suddenly transferred to an actor and their boundaries. Often it is presented as though there is no other option, no possible solution besides a change to the intimate scene. Productions can make this feel like a monolithic pressure for an actor – or even an intimacy coordinator – to push back on. Despite huge strides made in our understanding of consent, trauma and power since the Weinstein scandal and rise of #MeToo, the TV and film industry remains reluctant to change in some key ways. Many professionals still fail to see why the risks of psychological injury on set deserve the same attention as the risks of physical injury. For actors, who rely on their emotional capacity to do their jobs, a psychological trauma on set can be career-ending (see Last Tango in Paris for a harrowing example). We are going to have to learn to not only change the way we think and talk about consent, but consider what compromises we are willing to make to ensure it is maintained. In the US, Screen Actors Guild contracts are governed by a 48-hour rule: any changes to the content or scope of an intimate scene need to be submitted to an actor’s agent at least 48 hours in advance of filming. This is not yet a legal requirement in the UK, though it is generally considered best practice. I look forward to best practice becoming typical practice. Even with improved legislation, Hollywood has a power problem, and cases like Hussey and Whiting’s remind us that this is nothing new. Unfortunately, it is not, yet, entirely old either. The solution is not only for productions to hire specialists like intimacy coordinators (and access coordinators, and wellbeing coordinators), but to listen and consistently implement their expertise, instead of enlisting them solely as a tick-box exercise. As an industry we need to demonstrate our true willingness to upend some of the longstanding traditions of unhealthy working environments once affectionately written off as “showbiz, baby!”.

The plant in eastern Ukraine is under Russian occupation and was disconnected from the national power supply for several hours before a last remaining line supplying electricity that cools the reactors was reconnected. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. The death toll from Russia’s rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station has risen to 25 people. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its forces struck the railway station, prompting condemnation from the US and the EU. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the attack “fits a pattern of atrocities” while the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said those responsible would be held to account. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early on Thursday morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said “several” explosions were heard at about 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, was set to speak to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-24T01:16:10Z","webTitle":"BuzzFeed cooks up new AI-powered recipe generator, Botatouille","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2023/may/23/buzzfeed-ai-recipe-generator-botatouille","fields":{"bodyText":"As media companies sort through the ways artificial intelligence will impact their operations, BuzzFeed on Tuesday launched Botatouille, a personalized recipe generator powered by generative AI. In addition to Botatouille, which BuzzFeed describes as, “the first AI-powered culinary companion” that suggests recipes based on factors like what you already have in your refrigerator, there’s also a chatbot feature that allows people to ask culinary questions while they cook, according to a press release from the company. Botatouille, which doesn’t appear to be inspired by the Disney movie about the cartoon rat-chef, is part of a slew of AI-generated content like games and quizzes that BuzzFeed hopes will drive users back to their platform as the brand shut down its award-winning news division earlier this month. BuzzFeed, chief executive Jonah Peretti told investors on 11 May, will “focus on making the internet more fun”. “Readers are sick of all the negative news in their social media feeds,” Peretti told investors. “They will increasingly want social media platforms to provide an escape where they can find entertainment, joy and fun.” BuzzFeed had already told employees in January it had used AI to ‘enhance’ its content and quizzes. Peretti announced the end of BuzzFeed News last month, a move that came after several rounds of deep cuts. The division had won a Pulitzer prize in 2021 for an investigation into China’s mass detention of Muslims. Peretti cited a range of challenges, including the pandemic, declining stock market, a slowdown in digital advertising and changing audience habits. The move was met with deep disappointment from the company’s staff, sharp criticisms of Peretti’s leadership with managing the company and arguments that the layoffs were another example of corporate leadership’s devaluation of workers and eagerness to embrace AI as a replacement for humans. Other news sites that boomed during the 2010s, including Vice and Insider have also struggled as audiences and advertisers moved away from social media and towards video services such as YouTube and TikTok.

The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. “If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said Thursday’s incident represented the plant’s first complete disconnection in its nearly 40 years of operation. Electricity is used for cooling and safety systems. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after Joe Biden spoke to Zelenskiy on Thursday. The US state department also cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site. “The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,” spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. “No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. “We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Writing on Telegram, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, said satellite photos showed the local forest in flames. He said towns in the area lost power for several hours on Thursday. “This was caused by the disconnection of power lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station as a result of provocations by Zelenskiy’s fighters,” Rogov claimed. “The disconnection itself was triggered by a fire and short circuit on the power lines.” Nuclear experts have warned of the risk of damage to the plant’s spent nuclear fuel pools or its reactors. Cuts in the power needed to cool the pools could cause a disastrous meltdown. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The complex supplied more than 20% of Ukraine’s electricity needs and its loss would pile new strain on the government. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive.

The Generation Plan proposed a mix of renewable energy, gas-peaking plants and battery storage, some of which would be on or near Liddell’s site in the New South Wales Hunter Valley. Its sister coal-fired power station, Bayswater, would also get an upgrade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup AGL’s then chief executive, Andy Vesey, estimated the capital investment would total almost $1.4bn, with the new assets operating for as long as 30 years. By contrast, extending Liddell’s life beyond its planned 2022 closure would cost $920m and only add five years to a plant then almost 50 years old. As events transpired, the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Vesey both got rolled on the same day, 24 August 2018. “They lost their PM over energy and we lost a CEO,” one AGL insider says. With Liddell finally shutting on 28 April, business leaders and local officials are hopeful alternative generation projects and manufacturing will eventually fill the site even if few of AGL’s proposed ventures have progressed. “There was initially a level of ‘this is going to be a bit of a shock to the system’,” says Danny Eather, president of Business Singleton, which represents about 180 local businesses. “Liddell is really beyond its lifespan as a facility, and I think there’s a general acceptance within the community that this is what had to happen.” Mike Kelly, president of the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, further up the Hunter Valley, says it’s still unclear what will replace Liddell. “Despite the early notice [of Liddell’s demise], driven by government policy, there is still a lot of uncertainty and cynicism,” Kelly says. “You wouldn’t turn off the town water supply to your house if you were planning to put in big tanks next year,” he says. “And you wouldn’t turn off the grid main supply if you’re planning to put solar panels and wind turbines on your property in the next year or two or five.” Authorities, though, are confident Liddell’s shutdown won’t disrupt the power grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator forecasts the state “will maintain a reliable power supply”, says Penny Sharpe, the state’s new energy minister. “Liddell is now more than 50 years old. It’s been unreliable for many years, and not operating at its rated capacity,” Sharpe says. “In 2022, Liddell made around 1,260 megawatts available, a fraction of its 2,000MW rated capacity, and generated only around 7,000 gigawatt-hours across the year.” Vesey’s successor at AGL, Brett Redman, became much more cautious about the rush to invest in new renewables. Plans for a gas-peaker plant near Goulburn and one in the lower Hunter were scrapped altogether, while investments in new batteries and pumped hydro plants at Liddell or nearby have taken longer than expected, insiders say. Management wanted “no additional risk” for coal generation, one of them says. “What was happening in the background was that the business was haemorrhaging cash.” Also disrupting AGL’s intentions were interventions in the market by the Turnbull and then Morrison governments, not least Snowy Hydro’s giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and then its Kurri Kurri gas plant in NSW. These threw the whole Generation Plan “out of the window”, they say. Markus Brokhof, AGL’s chief operating officer, is keen to see people move on from that earlier plan. “Forget about this, it is history,” he said during a recent visit to Liddell. Brokhof is proud Bayswater has been able to absorb 100 of Liddell’s 140 staff, meaning AGL kept its promise there would be no forced redundancies. The rest will retire or leave the industry. Bayswater’s crew of 460 will swell to 560, with contractors and sub-contractors being cut to make way for the newcomers. AGL aims to make a final investment decision on a 500MW battery for Liddell “probably in the second half of this year”, Brokhof says. A second battery of the same size may be a future option for a site near the Tomago aluminium smelter, AGL’s biggest customer, also in the Hunter region. A 250MW pumped hydro project about 11km from Liddell that would use a deep coalmine void created by Japan’s Idemitsu Corporation remains at the feasibility study stage. “We are exploring double that [size],” Brokhof says. Hydrogen production is another option for a post-Liddell future. AGL last year expanded a feasibility study involving Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries and other partners to explore development of a green hydrogen and ammonia production facility. Luring other manufacturers to a site well-served with high voltage transmission, roads and railway is another aim of AGL’s. Agriculture may even feature, Brokhof says. A mining engineer by training, Brokhof hails from Dusseldorf, part of the Ruhr region of Germany that has been navigating a transition off mining and heavy industry for decades. “There are thousands of templates” about how to help communities adjust, he said, while walking near Lake Liddell. “Australia is not an island. It’s a bit annoying.” Another insider says locals should expect news of a “big deal” later this year about other companies willing to bring investments. AGL’s Liddell-Bayswater site, bought from the state government for $1.5bn in 2014, covers 10,000 hectares and also about 40% of the high-security water rights in the Hunter. The water licences, linked to the power stations, are among the largest in Australia and roughly equal the total water available to farms and mines in the valley. However, the area’s transition away from fossil fuels may need to speed up, particularly if Bayswater’s closure is brought forward and the mines start to shut. “The latest is 2033,” Brokhof says, referring to the shutdown timing of the 2,640MW plant. The end of a relatively low-cost coal contract in 2028, however, could challenge Bayswater’s economics before then. A reduced operation, such as retaining just one or more of the four units, may be the result, people familiar with the plant say. Steve Reynolds, mayor of Muswellbrook, worries the community won’t be ready for what is coming. “We’re in for a turbulent time, there’s no doubt, with the transformation that is going to happen across this region,” Reynolds says. “We really need that person from the state government, specifically, that’s going to assist us because there’s so many different departments that are siloed under environmental minister, the mining regulator [and so on],” he says. “If we miss this boat, it will be the generations to come that will pay for their failures.” Michele O’Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, says a national energy transition authority is required to improve coordination. “This is something we should have done at least a decade ago and we’ve left many communities without the support needed,” she says. Such a body could help diversify the economy “and create good secure long-term jobs well before closures happen”, O’Neil says. “It can’t just be left up to the market”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T07:00:19Z","webTitle":" Nationwide’s rules left me unable to use my power of attorney","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/nov/28/nationwides-rules-unable-use-power-of-attorney","fields":{"bodyText":"My mother has dementia and now lives in a care home, so I have a power of attorney (POA) to manage her finances. She had a cash Isa with Nationwide Building Society which matured in August and, despite my efforts, we have still not received the closure cheque for £15,240. This is my mother’s money and we need it to pay for her care in the medium term. At first, Nationwide would not speak to me or answer my letters and emails because they said I needed to register the POA with their specialist team. However, they could not do this because the account is closed and there are no others in her name. My mother’s post is redirected to my address and I need to know if a cheque was issued by Nationwide and, if it was, what has happened to it. My mother can’t sort this out herself. But like many organisations, Nationwide is difficult to deal with. They don’t answer letters and emails, take ages to answer the phone and do not publish useful information on their website. I have raised a formal complaint but can you help? JT, Cockermouth You found yourself in a catch-22 situation because you could not register your POA with Nationwide as your mother’s only account with it had been closed. The matter was complicated by the building society’s use of your mother’s old address and the mysterious disappearance of the cheque in the post. Nationwide says: “Unfortunately, the power of attorney and address changes weren’t actioned alongside the Isa maturity instructions. This meant that when the cheque didn’t arrive, our member’s daughter was unable to speak to us to resolve the matter. We have now cancelled the original cheque and sent the funds directly to the daughter’s account. We have also contacted her to apologise that her experience fell below our usual high standards and have offered her £200 compensation, which she has accepted.” You are relieved that this problem is resolved but point out that your mother is one of many whose affairs are being managed by a relative and complain that Nationwide failed to engage with you. You are glad not to have to deal with them again and will donate the £200 to charity. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Twelve years on Qatar 2022 has now concluded with the same phrase hanging in the air. Project Hard Football Power is complete. And it really could not have gone any better, a micromanaged power play, from the pharaonic-scale nation-building project, to the painted backdrop sets, to the regional visibility that helped see Qatar through the blockade years, to the chance at the death to parade Lionel Messi around the winners’ enclosure like a beaming Guy Fawkes dummy. The winner is ... Qatar! There were layers to that moment of ignition back in December 2010. Blatter’s strange tone spoke to the fact that he also knew he was reading out his own redundancy note, that Qatar’s victory indicated he, Blatter, had lost control of the show. Standing there stiff as a board, Blatter nudged Jérôme Valcke, who looked as if he was about to cry, and ordered him to smile. On the back of that moment the house of Blatter would fall, the regime of the more opaque and unknowable Gianni Infantino would rise. And that stage of the cycle is now done. The most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport is a wrap. But what does it mean? And what next? Qatar 2022 also signalled the end of a few other things. For starters, the end of the pretence, and it was always a pretence, that there is any kind of innocence about Fifa’s World Cup; that this is anything other than a marauding city state, out there circling the globe looking for the next compliant and complicit host to share in its gluttony. Qatar has transformed football: you also hear this a lot. In reality Qatar has simply supercharged what was already there, presented us with football’s standard corruption and hypocrisy stripped of artifice and gleamingly unapologetic. Qatar didn’t invent this world, didn’t invent migrant labour, didn’t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form, like the Beatles taking rock and roll to America. On a more micro level the end of this World Cup is also the end of a generation of great players, perhaps even an end to the age of the modern-day individualist, a lineage that runs though Ronaldinho to Messi. Football is more compressed, more systems-led, more controlled than ever. It seems possible the highest stage may never again see a baggy, strolling 35-year-old conjurer of patterns. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski, goodnight ladies, sweet ladies, good night. And for now, as the comedown starts to bite, there are probably three things worth saying about Qatar 2022. First, the football was excellent. The action on the pitch was luminous, packed with drama and topped with the greatest World Cup final ever staged. There is no meaning to this, no moral to be drawn. The World Cup was good because football is good. This is why Qatar paid $220bn to borrow its light. It is why Fifa will rake in $7bn revenue from the show. This thing is supernaturally resilient, no matter how hard we may try to bend it out of shape. There has been a lot of talk about the breadth and reach of this World Cup, the idea of new powers, a new world order. It is a good propaganda line for the organisers and host broadcasters. In reality eight of the last 16, five of the last eight, two of the final four were European nations. We did get Morocco and the thrill of a first African semi-finalist but even this is more complex. This was also a diaspora triumph, a triumph of expert management and fine domestic facilities, combined with multiculturalism. Seven starting players were products of European club academies and European childhoods, gelled into place with a Moroccan sense of togetherness that seemed to offer a model of how to live these many identities. This story is more nuanced, more interesting than simple parping regionalism. Otherwise the entertainment was derived from dramatic finishes and in-game tension as much as high quality. Take away Messi and there were no really exceptional teams outside France and Argentina. England, Croatia and Morocco were the second rank here. This is some pretty functional football. But they produced great games, plenty of goals, good refereeing and a welcome absence of red cards. Fernando Santos single-handedly saved football by dropping Ronaldo and playing a 21-year-old who scored a hat-trick, one of the great managerial flexes of all time. Croatia were a captivating bunch of super-smart dinosaurs. Brazil did Brazil. And it was all a good job too because a bad World Cup on the pitch might just have fatally wounded the whole idea of international football given the backdrop to this thing. Otherwise Messi wrote the story of Qatar 2022 and did so while manifesting the key paradox of Big Football. Here is a player whose talent expresses freedom, beauty, love, imagination, uplifting human qualities. Messi is basically a sporting unicorn – and a highly unusual unicorn, the kind of unicorn even other unicorns look at and say: ‘That unicorn, he’s a bit special.’ Often the word “player” can feel like a ludicrous anachronism. Play is fun, joy, gratuitous things. Modern football, meanwhile, is a suffocating matrix, all constriction and physicality. Somehow Messi, the greatest footballer of the age, is also a player. At the same time his professional existence is still lived out as a tool of despotic regimes, pegged out around the commoditised global game. Messi is the face of Qatar’s propaganda World Cup. Messi is Saudi Arabia’s tourism ambassador. It is almost an act of unintended rebellion to be all these things and to perform the way he does, the rebel heart to Argentinian football expressed not through any conscious act of will, not through guns and cops and drugs, but through a way of playing, the whisper of a free spirit. Aside from all this, we still have the death. Not to mention suffering, corruption and grotesque monarchical vanity. So many things at this World Cup have seemed to be screaming in horror, from the open mouths of the gleaming stadium roofs, to the frightening cartoon avatars of the Bein Sports graphics, to the mind-numbing universal public address system. The stage was haunted by ghosts. The People’s World Cup was also the dead people’s World Cup. We can argue over the final tally, which is also part of the horror, the lack of care, death as part of life, in the words of the dear old Supreme Delivery Committee. But this has been football as an accessory of the overclass world, football as VVIP product. There are other costs. An otherworldly chill settled over Lusail Iconic Stadium an hour before kick-off in the World Cup final. Rain? Guilt? No, this was the giant-scale air-conditioning, brainchild of Qatar’s famous “Dr Cool”, whose indirect carbon footprint must be one of the most terrifyingly vast on earth. Hopefully Dr Cool also recycles and rides a bike. But we all pay for this in the end. Otherwise this was also a World Cup of illusion and fakery, football in the age of populism and post-truth. Concerns about a lack of care by the hosts have been routinely dismissed with useful, dead-end moral relativism; even described, absurdly, as racism (reality: few things are as racist as a structurally racist state carelessly harming migrant workers). Fifa introduced the idea of “unnatural lost time” at this World Cup and Qatar 2022 has often felt like this, from the artful fakery of Stadium 974, which pretended to be an ecological triumph, to the strange dance of the conscience-laundering armbands, presumably long since burnt on the Al-Wakrah docks like the 1970 squad’s van full of corned beef; to the malleable quality of Infantino who believes in revisiting European oppression from 3,000 years ago, but maintains he can’t be held responsible for what happened at Fifa five years before he became president. Feeling dizzy yet? And this is the final thing worth saying about Qatar 2022, which in the end is simply a mirror to the world. Qatar is not an aberration. Qatar is the way the world works, presented to you with brutal, unapologetic clarity. Other nations may have checks and balances, trades unions, democracy, free speech, ways of mitigating the brutality of rule by an overclass. Doha may also have wilfully neglected its duty of care to migrant workers, explicitly targeting nations suffering most from climate change to build its World Cup, because desperate people are cheap people. This does not have to happen. But in the end the real question about migrant workers is why are migrant workers so poor they are willing to do this, and who benefits from that world? Qatar 2022 may be a bloodstained thing but it is also a light and a lens, a crib-sheet on how the world works. Not to mention its superheated carbon centre. Qatar is the power source. Qatar is the winner: this was not an aberration, but a prophecy. A final note on what might happen next, beyond the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026 and our newly opened book on the morality of World Cup hosts. It was interesting that Michel Platini declined Emmanuel Macron’s invitation to attend the World Cup final. Platini is said to be unwilling to meet Infantino and his circle, whom he sees as malevolent architects of his own downfall. There is genuine enmity here. Platini is also free now of criminal charges. Infantino, newly re-elected, cosying up to world leaders, looks bulletproof. But if anyone knows anything about the things no one knows about, it is perhaps Platini, who doesn’t seem to be done just yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T13:00:38Z","webTitle":"Piano forte: Cate Blanchett’s Tár costumes set power chic crescendo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2023/jan/20/cate-blanchett-tar-costumes-power-chic-crescendo","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s the zeitgeist film that has split opinion. Critically adored, awards contender and praised by Martin Scorsese. On the other hand, slated by the prominent conductor Marin Alsop for being “anti-women” and scoffed at as patronising by younger audiences for belittling cancel culture. But there’s one area in which everybody agrees that Tár, Todd Field’s epic about the reputational downfall of a fictional maestro, excels: the clothes. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) embodies the power-lesbian ideal. Crisp, pale blue button-downs. A cashmere sweater slung over her shoulders when curled up in her gigantic, book-lined brutalist apartment. She marches down the streets of Charlottenburg in a luxe, virgin wool coat with padded shoulders, a silk shirt underneath. Clean lines and sharp silhouettes dominate. It’s the kind of aspirational wardrobe that has made people of all genders swoon – and generated fashion world approval. It was not a reaction that costumer designer, Bina Daigeler – who has worked with Blanchett before on the TV series Mrs America – expected. Usually, her aim is that “nobody should notice the clothes, although they are part of the language of the film … it was a big surprise to me”. But Daigeler knew from her first read of Field’s script that Tár’s sartorial choices were – as with all of us, but perhaps especially in Tár’s case with her self-mythologising – key to her character. Daigeler approached the task with the same level of research as she would a period film. The main theme was clear: power dressing. “I think we all do this – when we need to project strength, we dress in a certain way. [Lydia] Tár is a lot about power and strength.” In response to Alsop’s criticism, Blanchett has said Tár was “not a film about gender but about power”; but her silhouette is often a masculine one. Tár is a wealthy woman. Daigeler mentions Margaret Howell, Max Mara and Dries van Noten, among other high-end labels featured. Studio Nicholson and Lemaire supplied many of the staple pieces. The film’s budget was just $35m, which sometimes proved challenging, with Blanchett at one point joking that they had spent most of it on the Diana coat from The Row (which retails at around £3,000). Tár carries the iconic Hermes Birkin (from £7,000), and, for a woman who talks of controlling time, wears a Rolex (approximately £4,000) with the face turned inwards. Daigeler created an entire wardrobe for Tár, as though she were a real person. Some things were specified by Field in the script – Tár’s baseball cap when travelling incognito. Others were Blanchett’s ideas during fittings: the shirts worn over turtlenecks, for instance, a styling trick seen also at the recent Brioni presentation, one of the most luxe brands in the world. As well as haute designers, Daigeler brought in vintage blouses from stores in Berlin and New York, and a lot of custom pieces: “It was a complete mixture”. Tones were mostly muted to reflect Tár’s severe nature and to “match the grey Berlin skies”. It is also about lifestyle – there is little chance for Tár’s beige and pastel Oxford shirts and knitwear to pick up dirt when doing the school run in her electric Porsche and flying first class. Most important to perfect was Tár’s high-collared penguin tuxedo when conducting. They looked to the Austrian maestro Herbert von Karajan, and mostly other past male conductors, for inspiration. “I realised also when I watched Cate in rehearsal [conducting], that it was very important for her to be able to move. But also to have strength in the core. So I made these high-waisted pants to support her,” says Daigeler. There is an extended scene in which Tár visits the tailors and is measured up. As Tár’s world unravels, her put-together look becomes somewhat less put together. Tár is never going to wear jogging bottoms, Daigeler points out, but the outfits become looser, the collars less pressed. The sweaters hang untucked (all in the film are Margaret Howell, which cost about £300). Even trainers and a leather jacket make an appearance. It is about as shabby as the assiduous Tár allows. Given how nice the clothes are, I ask Daigeler if she took any pieces home. She didn’t. For her, “once a job is done it’s done” – but Blanchett did. “There was a very nice Dries van Noten suit which I have seen her in a few times since.” Is there anything accessible for Tár fans who might not have quite the income of a globally famous cultural icon? Try the New York Rangers baseball cap. Yours for £16.50. • This article was amended on 23 January 2023.

England have no divine right to beat the world champions every time they face them in London but as this contest drifted to its inevitable conclusion there were distinct echoes of the 2019 Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. England were not good enough then and they were similarly outplayed here. South Africa, at the end of a tough old year, fully deserved their first victory over England on this ground since 2014. Their forwards were as flinty as ever but their game-splitting try was a beauty, starting life in the visitors’ own 22 and ending with wing Kurt-Lee Arendse diving into the right corner some 80 metres away. The Springboks have been looking to expand their horizons slightly and here was further proof they have the players to do so. But whither England? Their autumn has been a curious mix of elation and exasperation but it has concluded with boos from the stands and many of the same old questions unanswered. Their calendar year return for 2022 also now makes for pretty uncomfortable reading. P12 W5 D1 L6 is statistically their worst return since 2008. The theory is that England should be judged purely on the World Cup and everything else is mere froth on the pricy Twickenham cappuccino. Which is fine if they go on and lift the Webb Ellis Cup next year. But, for whatever reason, this is a team that only seems to start playing when it has absolutely nothing to lose. Without the 60th-minute red card shown to South Africa’s Thomas du Toit, the final scoreline might have been even more lop-sided. Considering South Africa have also been beaten by both Ireland and France in recent weeks, it leaves Eddie Jones with much to ponder. If the idea is to blast past South Africa’s ‘Bomb Squad’ in the second half, the starters need to give them some kind of platform. A penny, too, for the thoughts of Rassie Erasmus, banned from matchday duties for his social media posts about referees. How he would have loved to have been on the field at the end, lapping up a result that will sooth a lot of green and gold angst. In terms of power and dynamism England’s pack finished a distant second even after Du Toit’s departure and, as a direct result, there was little cohesion behind the scrum either. From the moment Freddie Steward dropped a routine early high ball and his captain Owen Farrell tugged two of his first three penalties wide it felt like a hard day’s night from a home perspective. The Springboks were significantly more alert from early on. A smart variation to the front of the lineout almost yielded a try for Siya Kolisi only for the visiting skipper to be held up over the line, and England were soon spending an ominous amount of time in their own half. Manu Tuilagi, on his 50th England appearance, had a couple of early rumbles but was otherwise mostly a spectator. Tactically the Boks were also spot on. Midfield space was so scarce initially that it made complete sense for the quietly impressive Damian Willemse to slip back into the pocket and drop a goal to make it 6-3. England, by contrast, stuck to a playbook that was bearing little fruit. Marcus Smith kept launching predictable high balls and, with just over half an hour gone, the Springboks burst into counterattacking life. Willemse nipped away from Steward, linked nicely with Faf de Klerk and Willie le Roux and the nippy Arendse scooted away for his seventh try in as many Tests. Twickenham, the only disco in the world where drum and bass interchanges with Jerusalem, fell quiet. When De Klerk chipped over another penalty to make it 14-3 just before the interval it also left England with another second half mountain to climb. To be well behind at half-time to strong southern hemisphere opposition is unfortunate. To do so twice in eight days, as Oscar Wilde might have concluded, felt like carelessness. Inside two minutes of the restart England’s task became even harder courtesy of Willemse’s second drop goal, this time from 40 metres. It revived memories of Jannie de Beer’s fusillade of drop goals in the quarter-finals of the 1999 World Cup and prompted a midfield dust up between the increasingly upbeat South African forwards and their frustrated opposite numbers. By now things were threatening to unravel completely for the reshuffled hosts. With Tom Curry in the sin bin, the giant Eben Etzebeth crashed over for his side’s second try and De Klerk’s conversion and subsequent penalty made it 27-6. Despite Henry Slade’s 72nd minute consolation score there was to be no All Black-style resurrection. So add up England’s November efforts and what do you have? The angst against Argentina, the jaunt against Japan, the near miss against New Zealand and now this blitz to the Boks. Nine months remain until next year’s World Cup but the English public are not currently expecting much. Jones has rotated his starting XV to little obvious effect and other nations have England’s number. For a team with lofty ambitions in 2023, a solitary win over a below-par Japan from four autumn Tests is simply not good enough."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-20T18:16:40Z","webTitle":"Ukraine plans power cuts after Russian strikes on plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/20/ukraine-plans-power-cuts-after-russian-strikes-on-plants","fields":{"bodyText":"Ukraine has introduced an emergency schedule of power cuts to help stabilise the country’s energy supply, which has been badly damaged by more than 300 Russian drone and missile attacks over the past 10 days as the weather turns cooler. The country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said people needed to be “especially conscious of electricity consumption” from 7am and avoid using unnecessary appliances as he warned of local “stabilisation blackouts”. Three energy facilities were destroyed by Russia on Wednesday, the president said, with a further strike reported in the region of the southern city of Kryvyi Rih overnight amid growing official alarm over the impact of the Russian campaign. In video remarks to an EU summit on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia hoped to provoke a new wave of migration to European countries. “Russian terror against our energy facilities is aimed at creating as many problems with electricity and heat as possible for Ukraine this autumn and winter, so that more Ukrainians go to European countries,” he said. In response, he said, allied nations should provide more anti-aircraft systems and impose additional sanctions on Iran, which produces some of the drones Moscow is using. Kyiv and other parts of the country had enjoyed an unseasonably warm spell in mid-October, but on Thursday the weather was markedly cooler. The capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced the start of the “heating season”, where municipal boilers are turned on to heat apartment blocks. Earlier this week the president said 30% of Ukraine’s power plants had been destroyed in eight days, prompting pleas from the country for air defence systems from the west, which appeared to have been caught by surprise. There have been more than 300 strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities since 10 October, when the Russian campaign started, said Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister. To help cope, the government was seeking a 20% reduction in energy use. Some strikes have caused relatively minor damage, which engineers have been able to repair, but government insiders have acknowledged the destruction of some facilities is significant and could take more than a year to repair. A Russian airstrike hit a major thermal power station in the city of Burshtyn, in western Ukraine, on Wednesday. It caused “quite serious” damage, the governor of the Ivano-Frankivsk region, Svitlana Onyshchuk, said on Ukrainian television. Ukraine’s electricity transmission company, Ukrenergo, warned local blackouts of up to four hours may take place around the country at times between 7am and 10pm, because the energy system had suffered an “attack of the enemy greater than in eight months of war”. The public were told to charge phones and other batteries overnight, while street lighting would be limited in cities. All regions of the country would be affected, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the presidential office. The whole north-east region of Sumy, which borders Russia, said it would go the entire day without electric transport, street lighting and water, from 7am to 11pm. A wave of drone strikes hit Kyiv on Monday morning in the district around the airport, killing five when a residential building was hit, but on Wednesday further attacks aimed at the capital were successfully intercepted. The president said 10 Iranian-made drones were destroyed in the Kyiv area that day – and a total of 233 had been shot down during all of October, although the figures cannot be independently verified. The relatively cheap drones are frequently inaccurate, causing civilian casualties, as they explode near power plants around the country. Iran denies supplying the drones to Russia, while Moscow has claimed the Shahed-136 drones, rebranded as Geran-2, are made locally. But experts say there is little doubt about the origin of the drones, which have a distinctive delta wing shape – and that position was boosted by a slip on Russian television. Ruslan Pukhov, from the Moscow-based thinktank Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, asked journalists before a television interview not to question him on the origin of the drones, unaware that he was live on air. “We all know that they are Iranian-made, but authorities haven’t acknowledged that,” he said. The German chancellor said Russia was using energy and hunger as weapons. “Scorched earth tactics will not help Russia win the war. They will only strengthen the unity and resolve of Ukraine and its partners,” Olaf Scholz told the German parliament. But the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said Scholz had forgotten the lessons of history, referring to the second world war: “The German chancellor has clearly forgotten the Nazi past of his country and the 30 million Soviet people who were killed or died of hunger and cold during the war.” British intelligence said comments made by Russia’s principal commander, Gen Sergei Surovikin, on Tuesday that “a difficult situation has emerged” in the Kherson area meant it was likely the Kremlin was “seriously considering a major withdrawal of their forces” from west of the Dnieper River. Their position “looks shaky”, Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, later told MPs. Ukrainian troops are trying to advance on the city and are believed to be making progress, although their efforts are shrouded in operational secrecy. Oleksiy Hromov, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff, said Russia may leave only newly conscripted troops west of the river as it tries to evacuate up to 20,000 more-experienced soldiers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"‘Putin has gone mad from power’: Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin speaks out from Russian prison","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/04/ilya-yashin-kremlin-critic-speaks-out-from-russian-prison-putin-ukraine","fields":{"bodyText":"Writing from a cell in a Russian jail known as the Bear, Ilya Yashin remained as defiant as ever. In neat, blue-ink lettering, the opposition politician was able to express himself candidly despite his incarceration. Removing Vladimir Putin from power, he wrote, was a prerequisite to “avoiding the risks of a new world war”. “As long as Putin retains power, war, or at least the threat of war, will be permanent,” Yashin said in written answers to questions from the Guardian, delivered by his lawyers this week. “This man has gone mad from unlimited power and impunity, he has become a slave to his maniacal ambitions.” Yashin was sentenced last year to eight and a half years in prison for a broadcast on his popular YouTube channel in which he accused the Russian army of a massacre of civilians in Bucha. It may take regime change before Yashin, 39, tastes freedom again. Some Russians have taken to coining the jail terms handed down to activists and dissidents as PPZh, an acronym for “while Putin is alive”. In Yashin’s case, he admits that his release date is “difficult to predict”. “Obviously, I will have a chance to get out of prison if the government changes in Russia,” he said. But this is “not a question of today or tomorrow. It is clear that Putin’s goodwill cannot be counted on. He hates people who have publicly opposed military aggression in Ukraine and considers them enemies.” Long before Yashin’s arrest last summer, he knew he was in danger. Police had told a girlfriend he was a “step away from prison”, while a lawyer had told him bluntly that “if I did not leave Russia in the coming days, I would end up behind bars”, he said. Friends and family spoke to him about emigrating. “But none of my family manipulated me with a feeling of guilt and urged me to run away,” he said. “And I am very grateful for that.” Yashin appears at peace with his decision to follow the arduous path of a modern Russian dissident. A veteran of the protest scene that turned out on Bolotnaya Square alongside Alexei Navalny and Boris Nemtsov in 2011, he has evolved from a whiz-kid of the Russian opposition to something like its grizzled wartime conscience. And he seems hellbent – through his own example now – to prove there is a solid bedrock of Russians who oppose the war against Ukraine. “Why did I refuse to emigrate?” he wrote. “Because from the first day of the fighting, I understood that an anti-war voice should be speaking in Russia. It should speak as loudly as possible under the circumstances. Putin has done everything to silence the opponents of the attack on Ukraine. He intimidated Russians, he established military censorship, forced his critics abroad under threat of arrest. The Kremlin did its best to create the illusion of mass, total support for military aggression in Russian society. And I live here and I know that there is no total support, that many are against the war.” It is a thesis to which Yashin will return as he descends deeper into Russia’s vast network of holding cells, jails and prisons. He has already been moved five times in the past eight months, including a trip to Udmurtia, more than 600 miles from Moscow. In the Bear, his fellow prisoners include generals, deputy ministers, wealthy businessmen and a few political prisoners. But his cellmates were all arrested on drug charges. “Strangely enough, I very rarely meet sincere supporters of the war and Putin’s aggressive policy behind bars,” he wrote. “People here don’t really trust the Russian state at all, have faced injustice and are offended by the authorities.” Those imprisoned for “economic” crimes are more likely to be vocal opponents of the war, he wrote, including businessmen, lawyers and other professionals. “The rhetoric of such prisoners is usually very radical: they have seen the system from the inside, know how rotten and corroded it is by corruption, consider themselves victims of this system.” But there are others ready to go to fight despite rumours, Yashin said, of overwhelming losses and outrage that prisoners are being used as cannon fodder. As a rule, he said, they are either the very poor or the very desperate, those who have been given long prison terms for serious crimes and see war as “their only chance to gain freedom”. On a prison train to Udmurtia, he said, he met a 48-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for murder and robberies. He compared his decision to enlist as a mercenary to playing Russian roulette. “The stake in this game is life and freedom,” he said. “Moreover, with whom to fight and whom to kill, it does not matter to him … It’s like an animal instinct: just to break out of the cage, just to survive, just to get the sentence overturned.” What were sometimes called the “vegetarian” years of Putin’s rule, the days before political assassinations, mass crackdowns and full-scale invasions, are over. Russia’s democratic opposition is deep in the weeds. Navalny, its most prominent figure, was nearly poisoned to death and has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison. Yashin, for his part, suggested that with “empty hands” Russia’s opposition would be powerless to enact change from within. “There will be no opposition under Putin’s regime,” he wrote. “For the formation of a normal democratic system, its dismantling is required.” Asked what the west could do to help, he said he thought it could “send a clear signal to the Russian people that it does not consider them an enemy”. Russians needed an alternative to Putin’s imperialism, which brought death and poverty, isolation, corruption, arbitrariness, he added. “It would be a big mistake if the rhetoric and sanctions policy of the west degenerate into Russophobia.” Remarks like these have put Yashin at odds with some of Ukraine’s most ardent supporters abroad. They have said millions of Russians are to blame just as much as Putin for the war. Yashin has always argued the opposite, that “our society has also become a victim of Putin”. “Don’t get me wrong, I don’t idealise my people,” he wrote. “Yes, unfortunately we have allowed this criminal power into the Kremlin. People believed the propaganda, allowed themselves to be manipulated, did not control officials and security forces. All this is our responsibility. But this does not mean that the Russian people deserve to be defamed.” In prison, Yashin said, he devotes his time to reading, answering letters from supporters and journalists, and recording his observations for a book. He makes small sketches that “are not very skilled from an artistic point of view but reflect the atmosphere of Russian captivity”. Yashin has called the killing of Nemtsov in 2015 one of the two worst nights of his life. The other was Putin’s announcement of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Asked whether he thought his own life was at risk, he replied: “It is difficult to talk about this topic. After Nemtsov’s shooting at the Kremlin walls, Navalny’s poisoning, mass killings in Ukraine, you can expect anything from this government. “But, to be honest, I try not to think about it. Just to keep from going crazy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/aug/30/eu-fossil-fuel-burning-for-electricity-fell-to-lowest-on-record-in-2023-data-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-30T05:00:07Z","webTitle":"EU fossil fuel burning for electricity fell to lowest on record in 2023, data shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/30/eu-fossil-fuel-burning-for-electricity-fell-to-lowest-on-record-in-2023-data-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/aug/30/eu-fossil-fuel-burning-for-electricity-fell-to-lowest-on-record-in-2023-data-shows","fields":{"bodyText":"The European Union is stoking its power plants with fewer lumps of coal and barrels of oil and gas than it has ever recorded, data shows. The 27 member states burned 17% less fossil fuel to make electricity between January and June 2023 than over the same period the year before, a study from the clean energy thinktank Ember found. The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 – the first year for which they have monthly data – and “very likely” since 2000. The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found. “We’re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,” said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. “We have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.” To try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels. The report found that fossil generation in the first half of 2023 fell more than 20% in 11 EU countries and more than 30% in five of them. Fourteen countries saw their lowest total fossil generation on record for the period. In seven countries – Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Poland and Slovenia – fossil fuel burning hit its lowest levels this century. The findings back up analysis in June from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a nonprofit research organisation, which showed “a clear shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation in the EU”. But even as high energy prices have brought down demand, “the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels persists”, said Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at CREA and co-author of the report. He said: “This dependence extends to external sources as well. Given that a significant portion of the EU’s fossil fuel needs are met through imports from third countries, a vulnerability exists. Even a minor disruption in the supply chain could lead to price hikes and potential energy shortages.” The Ember report found growth in solar power continued in the first half of the year, making 13% more electricity than it did in the same period in 2022. Wind generation rose by 5%, while hydropower grew 11% after a shortfall from widespread drought last year. Nuclear generation fell 4%, but is set to climb during the year. Several countries broke records for the share of their power that came from renewable sources of energy, the report found. Greece and Romania passed 50% for the first time and Denmark and Portugal broke 75%. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, gas prices shot up and the EU introduced emergency measures to cut demand. With winter also unexpectedly mild, demand for electricity fell 5% in the first half of 2023 compared with 2022. The Ember report found some of the drop in demand was down to changes such as using energy more efficiently, but much of the shift was “not sustainable or desirable”. The report called on governments to build wind turbines and solar panels faster. It also said they should “urgently” expand the electricity grid, build more batteries to store electricity and streamline the process to get permits for clean energy infrastructure. “We shouldn’t be complacent about the winter ahead,” said Ewen. “You need to keep pushing.” This article was updated on 30 August 2023 to correct the EU’s emissions targets; they are a cut of 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050, not 65% by 2030 and net zero by 2045."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T00:53:21Z","webTitle":"Nuclear attack in Ukraine should spark ‘devastating’ Nato response, says Poland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/28/ukraine-nato-russia-nuclear-weapons-devastating-poland-foreign-minister","fields":{"bodyText":"Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, has said Nato’s response to any use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine should be non-nuclear but “devastating”. Speaking on a visit to Washington, Rau said the alliance was in the process of delivering that message to Moscow. The Russian military debacle in Ukraine, where its forces are being pushed back in the east of the country, has increased concerns that a desperate Vladimir Putin could resort to using a nuclear weapon, possibly a lower-yield tactical warhead, in a bid to shock Ukraine into halting its resistance to his invasion. “To the best of our knowledge, Putin is threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, not to attack Nato, which means that Nato should respond in a conventional way,” Rau told the NBC News program Meet the Press NOW. “But the response should be devastating. And I suppose this is the clear message that the Nato alliance is sending to Russia right now.” The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, warned on Sunday that any nuclear use by the Kremlin would have “catastrophic consequences for Russia”, which had been “spelled out” in private conversations with Russian officials. The Russian military has expanded conscription with the official aim of sending 300,000 more soldiers into Ukraine, though there are reports the real goal is considerably more. The mobilisation has triggered unrest and an exodus across Russia’s borders, particularly of draft-age men. “Obviously, President Putin is losing the war in Ukraine,” Rau said. “So his reaction to it is to launch mobilisation. But the mobilisation doesn’t seem to help him win the war.” The Polish foreign minister said Ukraine’s armed forces had already defeated Russia’s professional soldiers, so the new conscripts who were “poorly trained and poorly equipped” were unlikely to change the course of the war. Rau said that if the mobilisation did lead to a breakthrough, it would be in Russian public opinion. “So far, the war was popular, at least for the majority of the Russian population, up to 80%,” he said. “And now, every Russian family will have to take their own position towards the war, knowing that their loved ones can be sent there and they can be killed there.” During his trip to Washington, Rau is not meeting any members of the Biden administration, but will see congressional leaders, Sullivan’s predecessor as national security adviser, John Bolton, and will visit a new museum in the US capital dedicated to the victims of communism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2023/jul/12/aryna-sabalenka-powers-past-madison-keys-to-reach-wimbledon-semi-final-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-12T17:59:31Z","webTitle":"Aryna Sabalenka powers past Madison Keys to set up semi-final with Jabeur","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/12/aryna-sabalenka-powers-past-madison-keys-to-reach-wimbledon-semi-final-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2023/jul/12/aryna-sabalenka-powers-past-madison-keys-to-reach-wimbledon-semi-final-tennis","fields":{"bodyText":"Sometimes a rest is even better than a change. For Aryna Sabalenka, missing Wimbledon last year because of the ban on Russian and Belarusian players meant she had an opportunity to breathe, to reset. After reaching the semi-finals here in 2021, her career had been in danger of going off the rails, her serve collapsing, her mind imploding. On Wednesday, having already won her first grand slam title this year at the Australian Open, the Belarusian overpowered Madison Keys 6-2, 6-4 to reach a grand slam semi-final for the fourth consecutive time. “I was really sad that I couldn’t play here last year. But at the same time I was thinking: ‘OK, it’s a good time to kind of like reset and start everything over again,’” Sabalenka said after setting up a semi-final against Ons Jabeur, who gained revenge on Elena Rybakina for her defeat by the Kazakhstani player the final last year. “Before grass season [in 2022] I didn’t play my best tennis. I was struggling a lot with my serve, with these emotions, with a lot of stuff. I just took that time as a good preparation, as a good little switch. Everything started working better. I think in those probably three or four weeks, I did really good work, and it helped me at the US Open. “Then I kind of started believing in myself more, I started playing better, I started feeling better on court, emotionally I started feeling better. I think this period gave me so much belief in myself. I was very sad but at same time I was like, OK, this is probably something I really needed.” Against Keys, Sabalenka began well, breaking serve in a six-minute opening game thanks to some thunderous hitting. Keys got on the board for to trail 2-1 but after being broken again for 4-1, the American consulted the doctor and took some tablets. Sabalenka, the No 2 seed, wrapped up the set soon after but Keys, in her second quarter-final here, hit back well and when she broke serve and led 4-2, 40-0 in the second, it looked like she would take it to a decider. But Sabalenka found her groove again, winning 12 successive points to take control. A horrible volley over the baseline by Keys gave her another break for 5-4 and, though the American saved one match point, Sabalenka sealed the win with an unreturnable serve. “Obviously a very tough day,” Keys said. “I mean, I think Aryna played really well. I had chances in the second set and didn’t capitalise on them. Sometimes that’s how things go. Overall still a really good tournament for me.” Should Sabalenka beat Jabeur she will become world No 1 for the first time, fulfilling one of her lifelong dreams. The other one is to lift the Wimbledon title, something she has visualised since she was young. “I remember myself, I don’t know, 14 or 15 years old going on my practice with the headphones listening to music and dreaming of becoming one of the best players in the world, dreaming about lifting this beautiful trophy,” she said. “That’s something that really motivates me a lot, that I was able to become one of the best. I’m competing on the high level. I’m going to do everything I can to lift this beautiful trophy.” Perhaps the best thing Sabalenka has done in the past year is to calm her mind. Where once the tension was visible on her face after every missed shot, now, when things get tight and the pressure rises, more often than not she will smile. And even if she screams, it’s under control. Now it’s just about calming the thoughts of becoming No 1 or lifting the title. “I want both but I’m trying to focus on myself because I know if I’ll start thinking about all this stuff I’m going to lose my focus on court, my game. So I’m trying to make sure that every time I’m on the court I bring my best tennis. Then later on we’ll see if I’m ready to become world No 1 or if I’m ready to play another final.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T10:00:39Z","webTitle":"Will the ‘cool, calm, collected’ Hakeem Jeffries change when in power?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/05/hakeem-jeffries-rise-to-power-change-him","fields":{"bodyText":"Democratic congressman Hakeem Jeffries first emerged in the mid-2000s as a former corporate lawyer homegrown from central Brooklyn. With his focus on criminal justice reform and housing affordability, he was seen as a progressive of the moment who took on the existing Democratic machine in New York. Now, as the newly elected successor to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Jeffries has graduated from state politics to the national stage with the opportunity to make an impression on American politics for years to come. Last week Jeffries, 52, became the first Black leader of either party in Congress. Under the incoming Congress, Jeffries will be House minority leader, making him the most powerful Democrat in the House. His ascension, paired with the departures of longtime and elderly Democratic leaders like Pelosi, Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, signals a shift for Democrats toward a younger, more diverse generation of leaders that will undoubtedly face tension with a new Republican House majority on the horizon. But will Jeffries change? Some political historians argue that Jeffries’ rise fits into a pattern of Black lawmakers who, as they climb the party leadership ranks, become more moderate, raising questions as to how Jeffries will navigate the post differently from his predecessor, Nancy Pelosi. Katherine Tate, a political science professor at Brown University and author of several books including Concordance: Black Lawmaking in the US Congress from Carter to Obama, said it was “wise to elevate younger members right now” to energize young voters but questioned whether Jeffries would accomplish anything “radical or significant off the bat”. She noted that Jeffries will have to navigate competing ideologies not just within his own party, but with a seriously fractured Republican party controlling the House in the next Congress. Faced with his own party’s divisions – including a highly visible progressive wing influenced by fellow New Yorker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her “Squad” – and the chaos of the Republican party’s emboldened extremists, the next two years are likely to be messy. Jeffries “is not going to have his own agenda. He’s going to shepherd other people’s agendas through”, Tate said. Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents the south Bronx, told the Guardian that Jeffries’ rise reflected the strength of his ability to work as an insider and outsider. He described the fellow New York Democrat as “highly cerebral” and “cool, calm, and collected” – capable of talking about the intricacies of policy while quoting Biggie Smalls during former president Donald Trump’s impeachment proceedings. Torres expected, under Jeffries’ leadership, the Democratic party would be more committed to issues of racial equity, ensuring people of color a seat at the table, even as Jeffries manages and responds to the ideological forces within his party. Jennifer Garcia, an assistant professor of politics at Oberlin College, agreed, noting that Jeffries’ platform can be an empowering force for not just lawmakers of color but also voters. “Racial identity does matter and because of that, he will behave in a distinct way than past speakers,” said Garcia, who is writing a book on how Black Congress members use legislation to advance policy priorities for Black Americans. Torres said Jeffries is also “willing to reach across the aisle in the service of progressive change”, pointing to his colleague’s efforts in negotiating the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed in the House but failed to make movement in the Senate. “He knows how to build coalition and consensus over the caucus, and he’s the best communicator in the House Democratic caucus,” he said. Analysis by Voteview, a database of congressional votes from the University of California, Los Angeles’ political science department, shows that Jeffries, a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and of the Congressional Black Caucus, has a more moderate voting record than some older, more liberal Black legislators such as congresswomen Barbara Lee and Maxine Waters. Still, according to Voteview, his voting record remains more liberal than 85% of the Democratic party. Torres resisted any idea that Black lawmakers become more moderate as they rose in the ranks, pointing to Black leaders like Elijah Cummings, John Lewis and Jim Clyburn, who is expected to let go of his long-held position as the number three Democrat. “These people are not only progressive but they are also effective at advancing progressive agenda, which Hakeem has done,” he said, adding: “Neither the new guard nor the old guard are a monolith. The House Democratic caucus is by and large unified around a progressive agenda.” Tate said Jeffries came up at a time when the Democratic party was more open to Black leaders, enabling him to develop the mindset of working across the party and compromising rather than working outside the party. Garcia cautioned that the Voteview numbers were imperfect because they focused on roll call votes on legislation that makes it through hurdles to a vote. “Regardless of race and gender, as you rise in the ranks of party leadership, there’s adapting you have to do to attain that power,” Garcia said. *** Lupe Todd-Medina, a longtime adviser who worked on Jeffries’ campaigns, described Jeffries as a loving parent with a strong work ethic, and also spoke of his ability to work across the aisle. Jeffries, who has been described as “Brooklyn’s Barack Obama”, grew up in Crown Heights, now a rapidly changing neighborhood in Brooklyn, at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic and escalating crime in New York City. One of the few Black attorneys at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Jeffries was part of a class of eventual Black power brokers in the mid-2000s – alongside New York attorney general Letitia James, state senator Kevin Parker, and now Mayor Eric Adams – who were then considered young progressives out of central Brooklyn. “Those guys were not waiting for their turn,” Todd-Medina said. “It brought a liveliness and rebirth to local politics.” As a member of the New York state assembly, Jeffries worked with then-state senator Eric Adams to pass legislation to force the New York police department to stop adding the names of everyone who was stopped and frisked to a database used in criminal investigations. In 2018, six years after he was elected to Congress, Jeffries, despite opposition from fellow Democrats, worked with the Trump administration to write and pass the First Step Act, a federal prison reform bill. “He’s pragmatic. There’s nothing wrong with being pragmatic. There’s no purity test in being that,” Medina said. “You have to be realistic and work across the aisle and he’s always been one to know how to maneuver that well.” When Black lawmakers first entered a segregated Congress in the 1950s, their policy priorities were ignored by the Democratic establishment, Garcia and Tate said. Adam Clayton Powell Jr, a Black pastor who represented Harlem in the House from 1945 to 1971, was outspoken about how the Democratic establishment silenced him. He would introduce what was known as the Powell amendment to legislation to effectively stop federal funding toward initiatives that perpetuated segregation, Garcia said. “The Democratic party of the time won’t take up his agenda item. He continues to add it to everything he can. He can’t go through the traditional structure, he had to be a disruptor. People got pissed at him,” Garcia said. “They had to agitate to make themselves the force to be listened to or else they were easily ignored.” During the Reagan era, as more Black lawmakers ascended to political power, they were concerned Democrats were moving “too far to the right”. During the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s, when Republicans took control of the House, “this put pressure on Blacks to be more unified for the party,” Tate said. Today’s Democratic party is more liberal and diverse than before, and Jeffries’ ascension to House leader, along with Massachusetts congresswoman Katherine Clark and California congressman Pete Aguilar, reflected a significant generational shift in leadership ahead of a Republican-controlled House for women and people of color. “We will have to collaborate with Republicans to pass legislation for the good of the country and at the same time, we have to resist the worst of the Republican congress. There’s no contradiction to the two goals,” Torres said. “We will collaborate with Republicans when it benefits the country and we will resist Republicans when Republicans seek to do harm to the country.” In this atmosphere, Garcia said Jeffries’ impending leadership is “clearly a positive step and important symbolically to empower Black and brown communities”, adding: “I’m optimistic that there’s something about him that will take the responsibilities differently than past legislators.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T16:32:00Z","webTitle":"Attack on Ukraine nuclear plant ‘suicidal’, says UN chief as he urges access to site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-nuclear-plant-attack-suicidal-un-chief-zaporizhzhia-russia","fields":{"bodyText":"The UN secretary general has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” António Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Guterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency needed access to the plant. “We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilisation of the plant,” he said. Ukraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the second hit in consecutive days on the site. Ukraine’s ambassador to the IAEA, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, echoed the call for international inspectors and said Russian forces were attempting to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the plant, which was captured by Russian forces in early March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. He said Zaporizhzhia staff were “working under the barrels of Russian guns”. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom, said the creation of a demilitarised zone around the site and the presence of peacekeepers “would resolve this problem”. He warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster. “Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,” Kotin said. In a televised address on Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of waging “nuclear terror” that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow’s nuclear sector. “There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,” Zelenskiy said. Russian-installed authorities in the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility. The Russian embassy in Washington also released a statement itemising the damage. “Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on 5 August. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,” the embassy said. The head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. It has not been possible to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. The IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned on Saturday that the latest attack “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. In other developments on Monday: The Russian-installed leader of the Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree allowing for a referendum on joining Russia to take place. The Russian state news agency Ria Novosti reported that the declaration was signed at a conference of 700 regional officials where all present unanimously raised their hands in support of the referendum. In his video address on Sunday night Zelenskiy warned about “pseudo referendums” in the occupied south of Ukraine. He told Russia that choosing that path would close down “any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world”. Ukrainian forces again shelled Antonivskyi Bridge in the Russian-controlled city of Kherson, damaging construction equipment and delaying its reopening, Interfax news agency quoted a local Russian-appointed official as saying. Two more ships, carrying corn and soya beans, departed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, Turkey and Ukraine said, taking the total to 10 since the first ship sailed last week under a deal with Russia to unblock Ukrainian grain exports. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the agreement last month after warnings the halt in grain shipments caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, invade and take its territory, “then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world”. One of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies has claimed the west wants to destroy Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, who is now the virulently anti-western deputy head of the country’s security council, was speaking to the news agency Tass on the 14th anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. He linked the wars in Georgia and Ukraine as “one conspiracy aimed against Russia”.

It’s not unusual, unfortunately, for the victims of sexual attacks to find themselves distrusted and even accused. What rankles in the film’s approach is that the audience is also encouraged to question her story, with director Jean-Paul Salomé seeding the picture with doubts about the veracity of Maureen’s initial version of the events, even as it shows her vindicated in the end. It feels crass and manipulative to cast aspersions on the tale of a real-life rape victim in service of a narrative twist in a movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T21:16:43Z","webTitle":"Georgia governor signs bill that allows removal of district attorneys ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/05/georgia-brian-kemp-bill-remove-local-prosecutors","fields":{"bodyText":"Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, signed a bill on Friday that makes it possible to oust elected district attorneys from office if they are believed to not be adequately enforcing the law. It’s a move that is seen a thinly veiled power grab to push out Democratic prosecutors, include some who said they would not prosecute abortion-related crimes. The new law sets up a statewide Prosecuting Attorneys Statewide Qualifications Commission with the power to investigate complaints against district attorneys and remove them if they have sufficient cause. The law outlines a series of offenses for which a prosecutor can be removed, including “willful and persistent failure” to carry out their duties and categorically refusing to prosecute crimes they are required by law to pursue. “I am not gonna stand idly by as rogue or incompetent prosecutors refuse to uphold the law,” Kemp said at an event before he signed the bill on Friday in Savannah. “Today we are sending a message that we will not forfeit public safety for prosecutors who let criminals off the hook.” The measure comes as Fani Willis, a Democrat serving as the Fulton county district attorney, investigates Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. A special purpose grand jury has already recommended indictments in the matter and Willis has said if there are charges, they would be announced this summer. Willis has criticized the measure as “racist”, noting earlier this year that Republicans were pushing the measure after the number of minority district attorneys increased from five to 14 in 2020. ““I’m tired and I’m just going to call it how I see it,” she said. “I, quite frankly, think the legislation is racist. I don’t know what other thing to call it,” she told a senate panel earlier this year, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The eight-person commission will consist of a five-member committee that can investigate district attorneys and a three-member hearing panel. The commissioners’ terms will formally begin in July 2024, the same month complaints can start to be filed. The commission’s members would be appointed by the governor, lieutenant governor and legislature in Georgia, which are all Republican-led. The new law is widely believed to target Deborah Gonzalez, a Democrat who was elected the prosecutor in Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties in 2020. Gonzalez has adopted a number of criminal justice reforms, including not charging for simple possession of marijuana. She was also one of several district attorneys in Georgia who announced last year that she would not prosecute abortion-related crimes. “This is not an oversight bill. It’s an overstep on the part of the legislature to undermine the voice and vote of the people who elected us as DAs based on our approach and what they felt they wanted, in terms of the way that justice should be done in their community. This just takes all of that away,” Gonzalez told Bolts, an online newsmagazine. Houston Gaines, a state lawmaker from Athens who supports the bill, said the point of it “is to restore public safety in places where you have rogue district attorneys who simply are not doing their job”, according to the Associated Press. The bill comes as Republicans elsewhere have moved to remove elected progressive prosecutors from office. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis suspended Andrew Warren, a Democrat, after Warren said he would not enforce crimes around abortion and gender therapy. In St. Louis, Republicans were moving to oust Kim Gardner, the circuit attorney for St Louis county, before she announced she was resigning on Thursday. Georgia lawmakers also previously passed a measure that allowed for a takeover of local election boards for poor performance. A panel reviewing the elections operations in Fulton county, the most populous in the state, recommended not taking over the board earlier this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2023/jun/10/the-sister-by-sung-yoon-lee-review-north-koreas-propaganda-queen","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-10T11:00:21Z","webTitle":"The Sister by Sung-Yoon Lee review – North Korea’s propaganda queen ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/10/the-sister-by-sung-yoon-lee-review-north-koreas-propaganda-queen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2023/jun/10/the-sister-by-sung-yoon-lee-review-north-koreas-propaganda-queen","fields":{"bodyText":"How to make sense of North Korea? It is not only the world’s loosest nuclear cannon, but a hereditary communist dictatorship, a patch of darkness in east Asia’s night‑time sea of light, one-third of George W Bush’s “axis of evil”, a state little larger than Ohio with the world’s fourth-largest military, a so-called hermit kingdom where less than 1% of its exploited and terrorised population has access to the internet. The west has often gone for the easiest answer: to mock it. It’s hard to imagine another human rights-abusing, nuclear-enabled regime being the backdrop for crass Hollywood comedies. But the ruling Kim dynasty has provided a reliable laughing stock for big-budget films from Team America: World Police, in which a screaming alien cockroach bursts from the corpse of a puppet Kim Jong-il, to The Interview, where hapless journalist James Franco is sent on a CIA mission to assassinate Kim Jong-un but ends up partying with him to a Katy Perry CD. The Sister, a detailed, insightful study by the US-based scholar Sung‑Yoon Lee, sets out to debunk this “profound condescension bordering on racism”. It uses the rise of the newest star in the Kim family business – the current supreme leader Kim Jong-un’s younger sister, Kim Yo-jong – to parse her country’s strange present and possible future, beyond the grotesque headlines. Over the past decade, Kim Yo-jong, now in her mid-30s, has become second only to her brother in terms of power and influence, and – controversially in a rigidly patriarchal society – his possible successor. As the head of the regime’s propaganda arm and a highly visible lead on its foreign policy, the “princess” has inevitably been portrayed with sexist overtones as somewhere between a charming, charismatic pop star and a sadistic power behind the throne. But rather than simply recycling the Kims’ cult of personality, The Sister underlines its roots in the trauma inflicted on Korea by the US and the USSR as they divided up its territory in the closing days of the second world war. On 11 August 1945, three American officers “poring over a small National Geographic map of east Asia … less-than-methodically determined that the 38th parallel running east-west across the peninsula was likely to be the northernmost line acceptable to Stalin”. The hastily drawn border between north and south sparked the devastating Korean war and sealed the peninsula’s fate as a permanent proxy battleground for rival superpowers. When the Soviets chose Kim Il-sung – a Russian‑speaking former guerrilla leader and Red Army major – to lead the new Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, its future became entwined with that of the “Mount Paektu bloodline” today headed by his grandson. The myth-building needed to create a semi-divine dynasty from scratch was extreme, and Lee is excellent on the regime’s reliance on suppressing, distorting and manipulating information – “North Korea is a state built on bold and blatant falsehoods,” he writes. Unmentionable truths include the fact that Kim Il-sung’s parents were Christian, that Kim Jong-un’s mother was born in Japan and that his aunt defected to the US – all “crimes” that would have entire ordinary North Korean families executed or sent to the gulags. And then there’s the famously decadent lifestyle enjoyed by the ruling family while the majority of its people endure poverty and hunger. (Lee mentions in passing the eye-popping fact that he attended an international school in Switzerland with the current leader’s elder half-brother.) While propaganda, now often overseen by Kim Yo-jong, is the regime’s favoured weapon of internal repression and external attack, its nuclear arsenal – which Kim Jong-un calls his “treasure sword” – is its ultimate guarantor. Over the past 18 months, the regime has dramatically escalated both its aggressive rhetoric and its testing of banned weapons, tools of blackmail and extortion familiar from an exhausting carousel of failed diplomatic initiatives that Lee, who has advised successive US administrations, describes in detail. His vivid account of surreal, intractable negotiations with the Kim siblings underlines The Sister’s central insight: Kim Yo-jong is very much part of the family. Even if she steps into the role of the first female supreme leader, change will not come at her hands. • The Sister by Sung-Yoon Lee is published by Macmillan (£20).

After leading a team of inspectors to the Russian-occupied plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, Rafael Grossi said that two IAEA experts would stay on permanently to provide constant monitoring and an uninterrupted flow of information to IAEA headquarters in Vienna. Grossi hoped the agency’s presence would help “stabilise” the situation there, after recent instances of shelling of the plant. But he said he remained very concerned about safety. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” Grossi told reporters. “Irrespective of the kinetic power of whatever you are throwing at the plant, it’s unacceptable under any safety and security criteria.” He said his other two main concerns were the external power supply which had been interrupted recently triggering the emergency diesel generators to switch on to keep cooling and other systems going, and the condition of the staff. Once back in Vienna, Grossi said it was “admirable” that Ukrainian technical staff were continuing to work to keep the plant going (two of the six reactors are still functioning) and maintaining professional relations with their Russian counterparts, but he added: “There is a latent tension there because of the obvious reasons of the war.” Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, Energoatom, had claimed that the IAEA was not shown certain areas of the site, and instead had witnessed a staged “show”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of intimidating residents in the nearby town of Enerhodar to lie to the IAEA representatives about events at the plant and “sign things”. Grossi insisted he and his team had seen “everything I request to see”, but he conceded he was not able to talk to any of the Russian soldiers who have commandeered the plant’s crisis centre as their headquarters. “The military presence there did not approach us in any way and were not available when I asked for a couple of occasions to talk to one of them,” he said. The IAEA chief said an alternative crisis centre has been set up but added that he will be requesting the military to hand back the purpose built facility they are occupying. Grossi left six of his staff behind at the site, but four of them will leave next week, leaving two IAEA experts there permanently. The IAEA is there to stay for as long as it is needed. We are not leaving. We’re not going anywhere,” Grossi said. “For those who may have intentions on the plant, knowing that international inspectors are there, witnessing and informing immediately what is happening, has an inherently very important stabilising effect.” Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over attacks on and near the plant, with Ukraine claiming they are false-flag operations carried out by Russia. Zelenskiy also voiced concerns over Ukrainian and international journalists not being allowed to travel with the delegation, as previously agreed. He said the occupying forces did not allow the journalists to cross the frontlines. “Unfortunately, IAEA representatives did not protect representatives of independent media,” said Zelenskiy, who said only Russian propagandists were present. Zelenskiy said the key thing for Ukraine and the international community was the demilitarisation of the plant. He said it was “bad that we have not yet heard the appropriate calls [for demilitarisation] from the IAEA”. Russian state media have published videos of Russian officials from Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear agency, giving the mission a tour of the plant. Grossi said his agency would complete a full report on the visit by early next week and he would brief the UN security council on the visit next Tuesday. The Ukrainian energy minister, German Galushchenko, told Ukraine’s 1+1 television channel that “it is important for us that the station must be under national control, meaning that the station must be returned to the control of Ukraine”. Grossi said the security situation was “pretty difficult” during his visit. “There were moments where fire was obvious, heavy machine gun, artillery, mortars two or three times – we were very concerned.” But he said the mission received “splendid support from the UN security team”. “I think we showed that the international community is there, could be there and we will be continuing this,” Grossi said. Zaporizhzhia, has faced repeated shelling in recent weeks, with Kyiv and Moscow blaming each other for the attacks, raising concerns of a possible disaster. On Thursday, a dawn shelling attack on the area forced one of the plant’s six reactors to shut down. On Friday afternoon the electricity supply to a reactor was reconnected after it was cut for the second time in 10 days because of shelling, according to Energoatom. The plant needs electricity for its cooling and security systems. In the event all supply lines are cut, the plant’s workers would have 90 minutes to avoid dangerous overheating. In a video address late on Thursday, Zelenskiy reiterated his frequent calls that all troops be removed from the plant. “The main thing that must happen is the demilitarisation of the station’s territory,” he said. “Demilitarisation and full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-27T17:19:35Z","webTitle":"What is the Stormont brake and will it help restore power sharing in Northern Ireland?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/feb/27/what-is-the-stormont-brake-restore-power-sharing-northern-ireland","fields":{"bodyText":"The most interesting part of the press conference between the UK prime minister and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, was probably what Rishi Sunak said about the deal including a “Stormont brake”, which will allow the Northern Ireland assembly to stop new EU single market rules from applying in the region. He said the agreement “safeguards sovereignty” for Northern Ireland as a result. It had been reported that the agreement – known as the Windsor framework – would give the Northern Ireland assembly a right to be consulted on new single market rules; but this goes further, because the assembly would be able to block new rules applying in Northern Ireland. Sunak said: The only EU law that applies in Northern Ireland under the framework is the minimum necessary to avoid a hard border with Ireland and allow Northern Ireland business to continue accessing the EU market. But I know many people in Northern Ireland are worried about being subject to changes in EU goods law. To address that, today’s agreement introduces a new Stormont brake. Many have called for Stormont to have a say over these laws, but the Stormont brake goes further and means that Stormont can in fact stop them from applying in Northern Ireland. This will establish a clear process for which the democratically elected assembly can pull an emergency brake for changes to EU goods rules that would have significant and lasting effects on everyday lives. If the brake is pulled, the UK government will have a veto. This feature of the deal – assuming Sunak has described it accurately, and that critics do not find a catch when they get to inspect the small print of the deal – will make it hard for the DUP to oppose the deal. That is because, for the brake to apply, power sharing at Stormont would have to be restored. That would require the DUP to allow the assembly to start sitting (by backing the election of a speaker) and to lift its boycott on participating in the power-sharing executive. The DUP has said it will only do this if it gets a deal it finds acceptable. If the DUP were to continue to boycott the executive, the “Stormont brake” would not apply. And the alternative would not be no protocol; it would be Northern Ireland still being in the single market but not having the veto as described by Sunak. Unlike the DUP, Sinn Féin is not ideologically opposed to Northern Ireland being subject to EU laws. Its main political goal is for Irish reunification, which would probably involve Northern Ireland fully rejoining the EU. Sinn Féin has broadly welcomed the deal. Mary Lou McDonald, its president, said: “We are now at a turning point and that is good news for business and wider society. People in the north want and deserve certainty and stability. The economic possibilities the protocol opens up must be seized to benefit people in the north.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-528-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-05T01:10:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 528 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-528-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/aug/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-528-of-the-invasion","fields":{"bodyText":"An “extremely fierce battle is going on” in the long-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, has said, with Ukrainian forces advancing “slowly but confidently” south of the city while securing control of positions north of it. “The Russians are throwing huge numbers of forces into the Bakhmut area,” she said on national TV. “It has been important for us to establish ourselves on dominant heights in these areas.” Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had made air and artillery strikes on the key village of Klishchiivka south of Bakhmut and surrounding towns, knocking out Ukrainian vehicles and equipment. Residents of Russian-occupied Crimea reported an explosion near the bridge linking the peninsula to the Russian mainland early on Saturday, but a Russia-installed official in the region denied the bridge had come under attack. Other pro-Russian officials in occupied areas of Ukraine said the explosions were linked to an attack by Ukrainian drones. A Russian landing ship was struck and disabled in the country’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk by an unmanned Ukrainian boat, known as a sea drone, Kyiv said. The 112-metre Olenegorsky Gornyak from Russia’s Northern Fleet, which has been used to transport troops and military hardware into occupied Ukrainian ports, was said to have been sufficiently damaged to have been put out of combat action. Onboard camera footage appeared to confirm the success of the night attack on the ship. Images of a Russian warship tilting to its side emerged shortly after the strike and footage was published by the Unian news agency from the head of the marine drone appearing to show it moving stealthily across the Black Sea towards the ship and hitting it at its centre. Satellite imagery also appeared to show a Russian landing ship leaking oil while docked at a Black Sea port. US bank JP Morgan this week stopped processing payments for the Russian Agricultural Bank, Russia said on Friday. JP Morgan had handled some Russian grain export payments for the past few months with reassurances from Washington. However, that cooperation stopped this week, Russia’s foreign ministry said on Friday. “The direct channel between the Russian Agricultural Bank and JP Morgan … was closed on 2 August,” foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian media as saying. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, visited a combat zone in Ukraine to inspect a command post and meet senior military officers, the army said on Friday. Shoigu got an update on the situation on the front and “thanked commanders and soldiers … for successful offensive operations” in Lyman in eastern Ukraine, it said, without mentioning when the visit took place. At the Russia-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, the UN nuclear watchdog said it had “finally” been granted access requested a month ago and that it had found no explosives after claims of mines being planted around the infrastructure. A court in Russia has extended Alexei Navalny’s prison sentence by 19 years and sentenced him to a special regime with the harshest prison conditions in the country. Navalny was found guilty on six counts, including inciting and financing extremism, creating an illegal NGO, the rehabilitation of nazism and inciting children to dangerous acts. He and his supporters have rejected the charges as being politically motivated. An associate of Navalny who worked for his YouTube channel also stood trial in a Moscow court on Friday. Daniel Kholodny, a TV technician, was found guilty of organising an extremist group and sentenced to eight years in prison, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-08T18:16:17Z","webTitle":"Canada hopes to join Aukus defence pact, says report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/08/canada-aukus-defence-pact","fields":{"bodyText":"Canada’s defence minister has said the country is “highly interested” working closer on defence technology with Australia, Britain and the US, after reports that the country wants to join the Aukus defence pact. The Globe and Mail reported on Monday that Canada was making efforts to join the group, amid fears that the country could be excluded from valuable intelligence and technology sharing between a smaller circle of nations. Both the foreign affairs ministry and Privy Council are working to have Canada included, the Globe reported. Asked whether Canada had made a formal application to join the deal, defence minister, Anita Anand, told reporters: “Canada is highly interested in furthering cooperation on AI, quantum computing and other advanced technologies with a defence nexus with our closest allies.” Anand said: “Our ties with our Five Eyes allies are strong, and indeed we remain interested in furthering cooperation in AI and other innovation efforts with our allies.” The Aukus agreement was seen as an effort by the three signatory nations to build up a greater presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and included an agreement to supply nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. At the time, officials in Ottawa downplayed the deal’s relevance to Canada. “This is a deal for nuclear submarines, which Canada is not currently or any time soon in the market for. Australia is,” Justin Trudeau told reporters at the time. But Canada’s exclusion from the alliance was seen as something of a snub for the country, and the prime minister faced sharp domestic criticism over Canada’s exclusion, with his Conservative rival suggesting the prime minister was “not taken seriously by our friends and allies around the world”. Canada has since announced its own Indo-Pacific strategy, to “promote and defend” its national interests in a region where nations are jockeying for influence and power. Thomas Juneau, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa, said: “There was a lot of hand wringing in Canada at the time, as there always is when we’re not part of something. But Canada does not want nuclear submarines. We don’t have the money for nuclear submarines at this point.” Canada already shares intelligence with Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand – an agreement known as the Five Eyes. But in the months since Aukus was formed, a number of working groups have formed to deal with emerging and disruptive technologies, said Juneau, who is working on a paper about the future of Canada’s relations with Aukus with Stephanie Carvin, an associate professor of international relations at Carleton University. Juneau said it was “definitely in Canada’s interest” to try to be in those working groups, though it is unclear how closely they will be tied to the nuclear submarine technology dimension. “The door is not shut for Canada to be involved, but Canada will have to show what it can bring to the table,” he said, adding Canada has emerged as a leader in artificial and signals intelligence. But amid growing criticism that the governing Liberals have neglected defence and intelligence investments, Canada faces stiff competition to gain access to the group as other nations, such as Japan and South Korea, also make a case for inclusion. “We’re not going to be brought into these groups, just because we’re a traditional ally,” said Juneau. “We’re going to be brought into these groups, because we can make the case that we have something to contribute, which in some cases, is a case that we can make.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-26T16:16:11Z","webTitle":"More than 14,000 in Washington state lose power after energy station attacked","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/dec/26/washington-state-energy-station-attacked-christmas-day","fields":{"bodyText":"More than 14,000 people suffered power outages in Washington state on Christmas Day following burglaries and a series of vandalisms at different power stations. The Pierce county sheriff said in two statements that no suspects had yet been identified for the incidents. The Christmas Day outages add to an alarming and increasing list of similar incidents in the US. There were six attacks across power stations in Oregon and Washington earlier this month, following a similar attack on a power grid in North Carolina at the beginning of December. In the attack in North Carolina, assailants shot gunfire into two stations, with some claiming that it was done in order to halt a local drag show. While there are no suspects in the string of attacks, there are concerns that at least some of these assaults are carried out by extremists, motivated by online conspiracy theories and pursuing a far-right agenda. The most recent incident in Washington unfolded on Christmas evening with a fire on the premises of Puget Sound Energy substation following a burglary. “The suspect(s) gained access to the fenced area and vandalized the equipment which caused the fire,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement on Sunday. Early on Christmas morning, around 2.30am, an energy utility company Puget Sound Energy experienced a power outage “where the fenced area was broken into and the equipment vandalized”, said another statement from the sheriff’s office. At about 5.30am, a break-in and vandalism in a Tacoma Public Utilities facility about 10 miles away, led to a power outage. Following that, just a couple of miles away, there was a “forced entry” at a substation where nothing was stolen. Tacoma Public Utilities said in a statement on Sunday that the issue was much more severe than they had initially thought. “Unfortunately, the impacts to our system from today’s deliberate damage are more severe in some places than initial testing indicated,” they said on Sunday evening in an update in a live feed on Facebook. Sgt Darren Moss of Pierce county sheriff’s department has said it was likely the incidents are related. “There’s a good possibility they are related, we are going to be investigating to see if this was coordinated by a specific group or people,” he told news station KING 5, “but at this time all we know is that we have burglaries where the power was purposefully knocked out.” Of those affected, more than 7,000 customers were out of power before the sun was up on Christmas morning, KING 5 reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-23T15:00:43Z","webTitle":"The elephant artworks interrogating Korean life: ‘When we get rid of the power structure, what will we see?’ ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2023/apr/24/the-elephant-artworks-interrogating-korean-life-when-we-get-rid-of-the-power-structure-what-will-we-see","fields":{"bodyText":"It’s a strange sight at an art exhibition. While people mill around, respectfully observing works from a distance, some walk towards a white sculpture with their arms outstretched. Then they put their hands directly on to it: the cardinal art sin. But this artwork doesn’t just invite touch – it depends on it. Wool and fabric cover a 3m x 3m, 500kg iron skeleton. The figure looks at once familiar and alien: its large ears and thick legs are instantly recognisable but there is no tail, trunk or face. Touching the elephant, something stirs. On display at the 14th Gwangju Biennale, the South Korean artist Oum Jeongsoon’s Elephant Without Trunk is the inaugural winner of the art show’s $100,000 Park Seo-Bo art prize. It’s the latest instalment in her ongoing project, Another Way of Seeing, which draws from experiences of difference to suggest new modes of understanding the world. “In my art career, I usually deal with the topic of what it means to see,” Oum says from Kote, an art space in Seoul’s bustling Insa-dong district. It’s days after the prize announcement, and the artist, who was born in the central province of Chungju in 1961, speaks mostly through an interpreter, Ho Bin Kim. “It was a natural process for me to also question what it means to not see.” Oum launched Another Way of Seeing in 1996, beginning as an art teacher for blind school students before starting her own workshops. Since 2008, she has been fascinated by elephants, after reading about the first elephant to arrive on the Korean peninsula via Indonesia 600 years ago as a gift from Japan. After the creature trampled a government official who mocked its appearance, it was exiled to the southern Jangdo Island. There’s a loneliness in this story that comes across in Oum’s works. Her award-winning piece, she says, “represents the current situation of minorities in Korea … I’m looking at the similarities between oppressed groups and the elephant, who was going around as a stranger”. Oum’s first elephant workshop took place at Gwangju’s Uchi Park zoo, giving the biennale prize additional significance. The blind students touched the elephants and shared what they felt through art. A workshop in Chiang Mai, Thailand, with disabled or ill elephants, offered a new depth. “We spent four days in the sanctuary, cleaning the animals’ poop and eating together. During that time, not only did they touch, but they also had the ability to hear and smell,” Oum says. “Because both the animals and the students had a disability, when the students were asked to create a narrative, they could really sympathise with the elephants and create products that are phenomenal.” Oum’s works inspired by these workshops have included paintings and mixed media, depicting elephants at various stages of their journeys. Commissioned for the Gwangju Biennale, Elephant Without Trunk includes three related works – some older that have been newly covered in wool. The trunk’s absence forces a new perspective of a familiar form. “When we visualise an elephant, the first thing we think about is its nose,” Oum says. “It represents power and hierarchy, and I wanted to make a connection to our society: when we get rid of the power structure, what will we see?” The work’s tactility invites the audience to experience the animal through different senses. I’m awash in childlike wonder as I feel the wool beneath my fingers, closing my eyes to immerse myself fully. “When you touch the wool, you get an immediate sense of something inside of you,” Oum says. Of course, works are usually not to be touched for preservation’s sake. Was there concern about degradation? “When I made this piece, I assumed that there would be damages,” Oum says. “I was quite surprised to see some damage already happening but I was also happy, because it means that a lot of people came to see my work.” The artwork will require regular maintenance as it continues its life at the biennale. Winning the Park Seo-Bo prize – named after one of Korea’s preeminent contemporary artists – is a boon for Oum after a long career that has gone largely unrecognised. “It was a cheer for what I have done for quite some time,” she says. “Community art involving non-artists is quite a new form of art and, in the eyes of a very conventional field in Korea, it has been underestimated. “Winning this prize gave me assurance, because many very well-established judges were involved. One [piece of] feedback from the judges was that it was visually satisfying, as well as portraying our current society and era very well.” The prize money will allow the artist to further investigate the possibilities of her dual projects. “What it means to see is a very fundamental question that artists have been asking for ages,” she says. “Because it doesn’t have a clear answer, I can use it as a pivot point to explore many other fields. As a person who works with images, asking these questions is what drives me to continue.” Oum and Kim laugh, before the interpreter turns to me: “She said that if I know the answer, please don’t tell.” The 14th Gwangju Biennale, Soft and Weak Like Water, is on at the Gwangju Biennale Exhibition Hall and various sites throughout the city until 9 July Guardian Australia travelled to South Korea courtesy of the Gwangju Biennale"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2023/aug/07/compassionate-spy-documentary-ted-hall","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-08-07T18:06:46Z","webTitle":"‘What people accused Oppenheimer of doing’: the untold story of spy Ted Hall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/07/compassionate-spy-documentary-ted-hall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/aug/07/compassionate-spy-documentary-ted-hall","fields":{"bodyText":"Nearly 80 years after it rattled the New Mexico desert, the Trinity test is top of mind for many this summer. Thanks to Oppenheimer, director Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster film on the leader of the Manhattan Project, millions have relived the queasy aftermath of the first nuclear bomb detonation in July 1945 – a scientific achievement of terrible power greeted with jubilation at Los Alamos. In a pivotal scene set during post-test celebrations, J Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist played by Cillian Murphy, stokes the flames of triumphalism while seeing the ashes of future destruction. At Los Alamos that day was a young physicist named Ted Hall, whose concerns outpaced Oppenheimer’s. Peeved by the celebrations and disturbed by the gleeful reaction to a weapon of mass destruction, he isolated himself in the army barracks. Oppenheimer would go on to hold grave misgivings about the US government’s handling of atomic weapons and the expansion of its nuclear program. But Hall, at all of 19, had already acted. Unsettled by the US government’s refusal to share atomic intelligence with its allies and the prospect of a US monopoly on the bomb, Hall shared aspects of the project at Los Alamos with Soviet intelligence – a secret that went largely unknown for nearly 50 years, and is left out of the hit movie. “What Ted did is what people accused Oppenheimer of doing,” said the documentarian Steve James, whose latest film, A Compassionate Spy, explores Hall’s prescient skepticism, his fraught espionage and his loyal marriage of nearly half a century to his wife, Joan. (Nolan’s film makes a point of Oppenheimer’s later political rivals who twisted his longstanding leftist sympathies into career-ending suspicions of Soviet ties; “I like to think Christopher Nolan copied us – he heard we were doing this, and decided he wanted in on it,” James joked of the film, which has brought the heated debates of Los Alamos to the masses this summer.) It’s part love story, part espionage thriller, part re-contextualization of national PR for the atomic bomb (bullish, sanitized) and the USSR (hailed, then demonized). Hall was not alone in his concerns over US handling of the nascent nuclear weapons program. Seventy scientists tied to the Manhattan Project signed a petition protesting the use of the bomb on Japan that was never delivered to the president, Harry S Truman (not that it likely would have made a difference). “There were a lot of scientists who began to really question what they were doing and questioning the fact that the Soviet Union was excluded from this effort, and were of course extremely worried about what we were going to do with the bomb,” said James. There were other physicists at Los Alamos who shared intelligence with the Soviet Union, including the German scientist Klaus Fuchs, who merits a mention in Oppenheimer. But Hall was the youngest to act, and to the most significant degree. “Ted is just this impetuous young 19-year-old who decided he was going to do something,” said James. Not that Hall regarded his potentially life-threatening treason as dire, at least at the time. In archival interviews from the years before his death in 1999 from renal cancer (likely the result of his work with plutonium at Los Alamos), Hall recalls his mindset at 19, freshly recruited from Harvard, as one of idealism aided at least in part by youth. “I was a young person,” he said. “I saw the world, I guess you might say, through rather pinkishly colored glasses.” “In my mind, this was a question of protecting the Soviet people, as well as all people, from attack,” he said. His fears were not unfounded; shortly after the war ended, Truman reportedly threatened to deploy a nuclear bomb on the USSR, lest they agree to remove troops from occupied Iran. The actual transmission of information, captured in archival interviews and re-enactments, was careful, though not the work of elite subterfuge. Hall relied on Saville “Savy” Sax, a close friend from Harvard and a devoted Communist, to actually make contact with Soviet representatives; the two communicated via messages encoded in books and letters and in less artfully staged secret meetings – methods Hall later remembered as more “comedy” than thriller. Nevertheless, the two managed to communicate rough plans for the implosion bomb to Soviet intelligence, which likely accelerated Soviet progress on their own weapons – they, too, had a deployable bomb by 1949 – by about five years, estimates the historian Joseph Albright, co-author of a book on Hall. The arms-driven cold war, and the USSR’s trajectory under Stalin, never sat easily with Hall, according to Joan – the emotional heart of the film and, it’s revealed, the steel behind Hall’s convictions, silence and conscience. James first met Joan, a “dynamo” who was “brilliant in her own right”, in 2019, when she was 91. “She was a woman out of her time, in a way,” he said. An intellectual and leftist who was briefly a member of the Communist party, she was politically active until heat from the FBI on Hall’s past forced her to recede from any organizing. (She and Hall eventually moved to Cambridge, England, with their three daughters; Joan died this past June, aged 94.) “She had an extraordinary life in her own right, and as much as anything, I wanted to tell her story as much as Ted’s,” said James. Translating their love story to screen marked a departure for James, a documentarian primarily known for his verité work exploring the fault lines of race and class in his home base of Chicago – the acclaimed film Hoop Dreams, as well as the excellent docuseries America to Me and City So Real. A Compassionate Spy relies on full recreations of Ted’s time at Los Alamos and Ted and Joan’s romance – tussling on the quad at the University of Chicago, revealing his secret while entwined on his office floor, barely dodging the FBI’s intimidation tactics. “I knew there would be no way to visualize [Joan’s stories] unless we did it ourselves,” James said of his decision to stage re-enactments. That, and to bring Ted and Joan’s youth at the time of their consequential decisions to the fore. “I figured it would be easy to forget that when you’re looking at a 91-year-old woman telling you stories, or Ted in the 1990s when he was in his 70s telling these stories, to forget how young they were and how brave they were in doing what they did.” “He was for his age incredibly knowledgeable and sophisticated in terms of understanding the way the world works,” said James of Hall’s time at Los Alamos, where he was the youngest scientist. “Without having access to classified documents or the president or the decision makers, he gleaned that it [could be] dangerous for the US to have this all to themselves.” “The film tries to make the case that whether you agree with him ultimately or not, those fears were not out to lunch,” he added. Late in the film, Joan recounts with scorn how the media did not take too kindly to the reveal of Hall’s secret late in his life, regarded by many as a betrayal of his country. A Compassionate Spy serves as a moving rebuke, both personal and sweeping. History may not judge Hall’s distrust of nuclear stewardship quite so harshly. • This article was amended on 8 and 15 August 2023 to clarify that Joan Hall was briefly a member of, though not an organizer for, the Communist party; and to correct the number of years that have now passed since the Trinity test (80 years, not 70).

Kim, who last month said the North’s transformation into a nuclear power was “irreversible,” said the drills were “an obvious warning and clear demonstration” to the country’s enemies. The regime’s short-range tactical nuclear missiles would be unable to reach its nemesis – the US – but could theoretically be used against the South and Japan. In a report carried on Monday, the state news agency KCNA said that Kim had ordered the test launches in response to large-scale navy drills by South Korean and US forces. Tokyo and Washington recently resumed the exercises, including the deployment of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan to waters off the east coast of South Korea – a move that infuriated Pyongyang, where the drills are seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. In response, North Korea “decided to organise military drills under the simulation of an actual war,” KCNA reported. Army units involved in “the operation of tactical nukes, staged military drills from 25 September to 9 October in order to check and assess the war deterrent and nuclear counterattack capability of the country,” the report said, confirming that Kim had personally directed the exercises. Official photographs showed Kim at all of the missile launches and exercises, giving orders and posing with smiling soldiers. “They’re pursuing a tactical nuclear weapon for sure,” said US-based security analyst Ankit Panda. “I suspect they’ll gradually nuclearise many of their new short-range missiles, including the manoeuvring missiles.” The fact that North Korea has described all seven of its recent missile launches as being linked to “tactical nuclear operations units” is significant, he added, since the inventory includes everything from short-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, to a new short-range missile designed to be launched from a submarine. Kim, who has presided over dramatic improvements in missile and nuclear development despite years of UN sanctions, has long wanted to acquire tactical nuclear weapons – smaller, lighter weapons designed for battlefield use – and made it a top priority at a key party congress in January 2021. Last month, North Korea revised its nuclear laws to enable it to conduct preemptive nuclear strikes, including in response to conventional attacks. Kim guided exercises by the country’s nuclear tactical operation units over the past two weeks, involving ballistic missiles with mock nuclear warheads, KCNA said, adding that they were meant to deliver a strong deterrent message. “The effectiveness and practical combat capability of our nuclear combat force were fully demonstrated as it stands completely ready to hit and destroy targets at any time from any location,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying. “Even though the enemy continues to talk about dialogue and negotiations, we do not have anything to talk about nor do we feel the need to do so.” The various tests simulated targeting military command facilities, striking main ports, and neutralising airports in the South. Tactical nuclear weapons South Korean and US officials say there are signs North Korea could soon detonate a new nuclear device in underground tunnels at its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, which was officially closed in 2018. Analysts say putting small warheads on short-range missiles could represent a dangerous change in the way North Korea deploys and plans to use nuclear weapons. On 4 October, the North test-fired a ballistic missile farther than ever before, flying what it said was a new intermediate-range ballistic missile over Japan for the first time since 2017. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said North Korea had “multiple motivations” for publicising the launches. “Kim Jong-un’s public appearance after a month-long absence provides a patriotic headline to mark (Monday’s) founding anniversary of the ruling Workers’ party,” Easley said. “Pyongyang has been concerned about military exercises by the US, South Korea and Japan, so to strengthen its self-proclaimed deterrent, it is making explicit the nuclear threat behind its recent missile launches,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T17:02:41Z","webTitle":"Queen’s stirring funeral shows the power of pageantry  | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/sep/20/queens-stirring-funeral-shows-the-power-of-pageantry","fields":{"bodyText":"No country other than the UK could put on such a spectacle (Queen Elizabeth II: from public pomp to a private family farewell, 19 September). Not a single person out of step. Trumpets, drums, bagpipes, all heralding the end of an era. Cannons firing, bells ringing, Big Ben chiming, choirboys singing. Row upon row of servicemen and servicewomen, faces etched in solemn regard. Columns of guardsmen, helmets gleaming, plumes wafting, bearskins bobbing. Line after line passes soberly by – a river of scarlet and gold in an ocean of black. The crowds bear witness to it all, a nation joined as one in solidarity for a queen the like of which we will never see again. Unforgettable. Jon Goldney Gawler, South Australia • I am on vacation from the US in the UK. While not normally a royal follower, I decided that I had to do the British thing and watch the Queen’s funeral. It was impressive. I am glad I live in a world that still has pageantry. I am glad I live in a world that can still have things that serve no practical purpose, such as kings and queens, and soldiers who have swords on their belts, fur on their hats, and move like trained dancers. I hope that there will always be room in this world for soldiers who aren’t carrying guns. Emily Anne Lyons Annandale, New Jersey, US • Charlotte Higgins (It was a gilded royal funeral, an event that will only heighten our self-delusion, 20 September) pretty much said what I feel, and the historical details she added – about the disastrous funeral of George IV, for example – were fascinating. Let us hope that there will be far fewer feathers the next time. I was particularly impressed by her careful use of the word “fulsome” to describe the BBC’s commentary. A shame she felt that she had to add the words “and mawkish” after it in order not to be misunderstood. Michael Bulley Chalon-sur-Saône, France • If Charlotte Higgins was reminded of RSC productions of Shakespeare’s history plays, the image may have been reinforced by the BBC camera picking out the portrait of one king in the abbey: Richard II. John Pelling Coddenham, Suffolk • The mood of gritty realism that describes life in modern Britain (unemployment, food bank visits, unplanned pregnancies) was briefly punctured in Ambridge on Monday when a funeral was briefly mentioned in The Archers, after the actual event had taken place in a parallel unreal world. At least the whole of the BBC did not succumb to royal overkill. John Petrie Leeds • How do you explain to granddaughters aged 10 and eight why not a single girl chorister was included in the three choirs represented at the Queen’s obsequies? There was one woman among the altos at St George’s chapel in Windsor, presumably brought in to beef up that line a bit. Girls sing the treble line just as beautifully as boys do, and it is high time we scrapped this ridiculous Anglican cathedral tradition, as they have already done at a few cathedrals. Tully Potter Tonbridge, Kent • Farewell to the Queen. The funeral was emotional; it made us proud of our country. It also felt like the last hurrah of the British empire. The last hurrah of a former world power. Hubert Schmitz Brighton, East Sussex • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Ryan Murphy – once renowned as the very Midas of soapy, campy television – has had a stock market crash this year on a par with the streaming giant’s own plummet. (Who’s working on the Venn diagram?) Murphy would once make hit after hit that hooked us without fail. This year, his output has gone from the outright tedious to the truly sickening. The worst offender was Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, which despite being grisly, nauseating and fetishistic about a serial killer who ate some of his victims, rode high in the Netflix charts for weeks on end. The other Murphian show that nearly made the cut here was The Watcher, which starred Jennifer Coolidge but was ultimately a duff thriller about a typewriter. Let’s hope Murphy’s next series of Feud – in which Truman Capote makes delicious rifts in New York high society – makes up for all this awfulness. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power Given the horrific racism that swirled around this show’s casting of non-white actors, as well as the glorious stand that Lord of the Rings stars past and present took against it, it’s not easy to say unkind things about this fantasy drama. But the fact remains that the show was a masterclass in mediocrity. Visually, it was stunning – but it needed to be, given that its reported billion dollar production budget supposedly made it the most expensive TV show ever created. However, its storylines were glacially tedious, its acting – with the exception of Morfydd Clark’s Galadriel – comically po-faced, and in the maddeningly twee harfoots and their Oirish accents, it created a set of characters that were like Jar Jar Binks for a new milennium – if Jar Jar Binks had been so offensively stereotypical he was borderline xenophobic. Given the amount of money this burned through for a show that launched during a cost of living crisis, it’s tempting to ask whether this series was the worst value TV ever created – and hard not to respond with a resounding “yes”. Conversations With Friends After the huge success of Normal People, this adaptation of Sally Rooney’s debut novel should have also been a hit. As the story of an affair unravelled, all the Rooneyisms were there: tightly packed dialogue, observations on class, growth and identity, a lot of longing stares, and endless space for intimacy. But what it lacked was a screen couple worth investing in – Nick and Frances were drips, and you had to sit through what felt like 27 hours to get to the real relationship of the story (Frances and Bobbi). Brilliant book; absolute snoozefest of a series. Chivalry With comedy giants Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani at the helm, and guest stars including Sienna Miller, Lolly Adefope and Wanda Sykes, this should have been a searing swipe at Hollywood in the #MeToo era. As Coogan’s character – a top producer terrified of being cancelled – meets the indie director (Solemani) he’s enlisted to help with his problematic new film, the sex scene they work on initially made it look as though we were in for a nuanced series with some sharp gags, which was never too on-the-nose. But it quickly drifted off and became confused about what it was, with the comedy faltering as the show went on. And the romcom-style ending was just bewildering – at no point were you rooting for them to get together. For a project that could have said so much about the state of things, it’s hard to remember what was said in it at all. Ten Percent In a world that seems to be populated by a new streaming service every few weeks, there should be no end of thrilling new stories to binge watch at will. So it was a curious and misguided decision by the ravine-deep pocketed Prime Video to commission an entirely pointless remake of the French hit Call My Agent. That show – about a bunch of chic, zingy agents to the stars – steadily became a word-of-mouth smash, snaring more A-listers to play their clients by the day. In the end, Juliette Binoche and Sigourney Weaver were banging the door down to be “represented” by the Agence Samuel Kerr. So why did Prime bother to make a lazy reproduction that was essentially a shot-for-shot knock-off? Even having the likes of John Morton of W1A fame as the writer didn’t lend this its own witty or satirical voice. Some of the British stars were worth a watch (Dominic West, in particular). But fans of the original knew exactly what we were letting ourselves in for – a British cast bringing a rehashed storyline absolutely no je ne sais quoi. Peaky Blinders There was much to love about this last season, from the tense opening barfight to the finale shootout with the IRA, which was so disorientingly murky and gas-filled it felt otherworldly. But it struggled to ever quite get going, with the first five episodes dragging their feet in a way that began to frustrate. No season of a show as good as this will ever be genuinely bad TV, but compared to previous outings, it lacked zing – not exactly what you’d expect for a series that was meant to be Tommy Shelby’s televisual swansong. In the end, the final scenes stopped short of offering any solid explanation for this being the end of the gang leader’s small-screen journey, serving only as setup for the forthcoming film. Not quite the definitive farewell we hoped for. The Witchfinder Given the stellar roster of comic talent involved in this sitcom, you’d expect it to be topping lists of the year’s best shows. Tim Key starred as a hapless witchfinder taking suspected witch Daisy May Cooper to trial, in a script written by the Gibbon brothers, the brains behind Alan Partridge’s renaissance. Despite seemingly every minor part being filled by a comic luminary – Ghosts’ Kiell Smith-Bynoe as hired muscle here, Julian Barratt as a fellow witchfinder there – it lacked the solid gags its pedigree demanded. No question that the stars shone in their roles, but it struggled to ever make you genuinely laugh. Midwich Cuckoos You’re usually on to a good thing when Keeley Hawes is involved. That said, last year’s Finding Alice was awful, as was this year’s Crossfire, and this adaptation of John Wyndham’s 1957 sci-fi book completes her terrible TV trifecta (although Hawes’s turn as psychotherapist Dr Susannah Zellaby is probably the only good thing about it). As Hawes embarked on her mission to get to the bottom of what all the freaky children of Midwich are up to, the parents’ glacial realisation that they’d spawned little creeps was borderline comical – given their terrifyingly stony stares and 1970s haircuts. The acting was mostly bad, the budget felt very low and the story offered nothing new in the context of women’s reproductive rights in 2022, which – as the women all become pregnant at once without realising – felt like a wasted opportunity. Killing Eve This adaptation of the Villanelle novels has long been on the slide, but this series reached new lows. A far cry from the days when Phoebe Waller-Bridge was involved and it was one of TV’s finest shows, its plot was increasingly nonsensical, it inexplicably lacked the fabulous couture outfits it was once feted for and it wrapped up with an ending containing such a disappointingly anti-LGBTQ trope that the author of the original books felt compelled to write a whole article disclaiming it. What a shame. Pistol National treasure Danny Boyle directs the iconic tale of Sex Pistols, as depicted in guitarist Steve Jones’s moving and funny autobiography: a guarantee of success, you might think. But this six-part Disney+ adaptation fell flat, with cartoonish characters that made the show feel like pantomime. What should have been absolutely spectacular TV instead felt tonally odd – and it never quite landed its attempt to bridge nihilism and sentimentality."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"}]}}
